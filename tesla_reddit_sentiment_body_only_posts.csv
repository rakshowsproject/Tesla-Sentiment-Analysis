TeslaMotors,feature,mz2cjc,"I made a Tesla app for iOS/Android, Bestla, which provides most of the features of all of the top Tesla apps but at a fraction of the price and with modern design, such as data graphs over time, Siri/Assistant support, widgets, tiles, scheduled actions, and more","I've gotten some really positive feedback on the app in the month it's been out, and I've made sure to frequently update the app to support the most requested features, such as adding Homelink support [this week](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestla/comments/mwxulf/v120_is_out_with_homelink_support_close_windows/).

[iOS app store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bestla-tesla-companion/id1551088174)

[Android app store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appuccino.bestla)

My goal here is for Bestla to be a companion to the main Tesla app, providing as much functionality as possible that the main app doesn't support. And, as the title says, I'm always going to keep it much more affordable (the main two Tesla apps that have a somewhat similar feature set are $45 or $10/**yr** \- this is $10/one-time or $1/mon), and *I will continue to work on it to keep adding more features, with 5 updates shipped this month already*.

I made the app free to try for 7 days, and any support it gets will let me work on Bestla more often by taking more time off from my job (software engineer at a search engine you may have heard of).

**Some key features:**

* View vehicle data over time, such as battery degradation, odometer, and temperatures
* Many ways to use actions (ex. lock the doors, open trunk) without opening an app
   * \[Android\] Google Assistant support, such as ‚ÄúHey Google, open the trunk‚Äù, with custom phrases
   * \[iOS\] Siri support, such as ""Siri, open the trunk"", with custom phrases,
   * \[iOS\] Shortcuts support w/ home screen widgets and automation (""lock the doors when I leave the house"")
   * App Shortcuts: long press on the home screen icon to perform actions, or press and hold to drag actions to their own home screen icons
   * \[Android\] Quick Settings tiles, for quick access next to other tiles such as WiFi and Bluetooth
   * \[Android\] Persistent notification with customizable actions
* Schedule actions (ex. warm the car at 8am on weekdays, or lock the doors in 5 minutes)
* Homelink support
* More in the full list on the app store

**App privacy**: The app does **not** store any login information. You can log in either with your Tesla account, or your Tesla account refresh token - the app will use the credentials one time to talk to the Tesla servers to get the token so that the app can communicate with the vehicle, and the login information is thrown away. The token is then stored encrypted so the app can continue talking to the vehicle.

TeslaMotors,feature,celh2h,Can Tesla Add Feature To Start Recording Inside Camera On Model 3 After Being Pulled Over By Police?,"I read [this](https://news.wfsu.org/post/ex-jackson-county-deputy-gets-bond-drug-planting-case-study-found-arresting-cops-isnt-rare) terrible article about a dirty cop in Florida planting drugs in people‚Äôs cars during traffic stops. It took a while to catch him, but they finally did. 

I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs possible to somehow have a software update that allows you to ‚Äúrecord all cameras‚Äù if you‚Äôre being pulled over by police...even the inside camera on the Model 3. 

I assume we could hit a button on the screen if the car senses that you‚Äôre stopped off the side of the highway or road. You hit that button to start recording with all cameras.

TeslaMotors,feature,eixy7d,Feature Request: Creep mode when in Reverse,"I absolutely love Hold mode and single pedal driving. But moving in reverse is still a little awkward. Back when I was an ICE driver I got used to creeping backwards and using the brake to control movement speed. 

I think it would be cool to have Creep turned on when in R, but then switch back to Hold mode when in D.

Edit: To be clear, I am aware that Creep currently works in reverse. The feature request is asking for Creep to be activated when in reverse, and switched into Hold when in drive automatically without having to go into the settings to change it every single time.

Edit 2: To be even clearer, this is NOT an anti-Hold mode post. The first sentence of the post says: ""I absolutely love Hold mode...""

Edit 3: A HUGE THANK YOU to whomever gifted me the Cybergift and 100 coins! Also, thank you to everyone who has contributed to this thread (whether for or against). It's clear that regardless of the creep issue, we ALL love Hold Mode. The Creep part is, at the end of the day, QoL stuff, and I think everyone agrees that if it were to ever happen it should DEFINITELY be optional.

TL;DR Tesla pls make a software patch to let the car switch automatically to creep when in reverse and Hold when in drive (as an option, of course)",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/eixy7d/feature_request_creep_mode_when_in_reverse/,Phatty8888,3012.0,0.9931

TeslaMotors,feature,nblfgg,"After the last post for the Bestla app for Tesla got a lot of attention, I've been working on adding all of the most-requested features. Today I released the 2.0 for the app, including Dark Mode, multiple Routines/Shortcuts, updated icon, foreground fetch, and much more","After the [last post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/mz2cjc/i_made_a_tesla_app_for_iosandroid_bestla_which/) blew up, I got a **ton** of feedback on features that should be added and bugs that should be fixed. I put a lot of work in the last few releases (this thing has been a ton of fun to work on, so it at least hasn't felt like work), and have added many of the top upvoted requests to the app. 

Between that last post, r/Bestla, and my app's feature tracker, I've been able to address things in priority order. Though I've added all of the most-requested features, there's still plenty for me to work on, and I'm already working on the next update. There's too many individual features/fixes added to post here, so here's the latest release posts from r/Bestla if you want to check them out:

**Releases since the last post**

* [v1.2.4/v1.2.5](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestla/comments/n42hns/bestla_has_been_updated_to_v124_with_a_new_app/)
* [v2.0.0](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestla/comments/nax8gy/v200_is_now_out_including_dark_mode_multiple/)

It's pretty awesome to see the support this app has received, and that last post sent the app store ranking (when typing in ""tesla"") from **#85** to **#13**.

**If you haven't yet had a chance to check the app**

*Here's the store links:*

* [iOS app store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bestla-tesla-companion/id1551088174)
* [Android app store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appuccino.bestla)

The app positions itself as one that is cross-platform (your database will always work, even if you switch devices), supports features that the vast majority of apps don't, and for those that do support some of these features, this is MUCH cheaper ($10 one-time or $1/mon, rather than competitors at $45 or $10/yr).

*Here's an outline of some of the things the app does:*

* View vehicle data over time, such as battery degradation, odometer, and temperatures
* Many ways to use actions (ex. lock the doors, open trunk) without opening an app
   * \[Android\] Google Assistant support, such as ‚ÄúHey Google, open the trunk‚Äù, with custom phrases
   * \[iOS\] Siri support, such as ""Siri, open the trunk"", with custom phrases,
   * \[iOS\] Shortcuts support w/ home screen widgets and automation (""lock the doors when I leave the house"")
   * App Shortcuts: long press on the home screen icon to perform actions, or press and hold to drag actions to their own home screen icons
   * \[Android\] Quick Settings tiles, for quick access next to other tiles such as WiFi and Bluetooth
   * \[Android\] Persistent notification with customizable actions
* Schedule actions (ex. warm the car at 8am on weekdays, or lock the doors in 5 minutes)
* Homelink support
* More in the full list on the app store

*And here's a quick outline on how the app handles privacy:*

The app does **not** store any login information. You can log in either with your Tesla account, or your Tesla account refresh token - the app will use the credentials one time to talk to the Tesla servers to get the token so that the app can communicate with the vehicle, and the login information is thrown away.

TeslaMotors,feature,nzu1zh,I feel like Tesla's communication around the Model S Plaid has been extremely dishonest.,"I feel like Tesla's communication around the Model S plaid has been extremely dishonest and I want to give some examples.

**0-60times LR vs Plaid**

 On tesla.com the 0-60 times are given as 3.1s for the LR and 1.99s for Plaid. *However* when you look at the fine print (and that only shows when clicking on feature details) you see that Tesla has ""With first foot of rollout subtracted"" but *only* for the Plaid making this an apples to oranges comparison.

If you were to also subtract rollout from the LR times the two numbers would actually be much closer, so Tesla is intentionally making the performance gap seem bigger than it is.

**The screen tilt**

Tesla advertises on the Model S pages that the center screen tilts but now it has come to light that this is something that is not available right now and supposedly comes in a software update. You cannot actually move the screen even manually. There was no mention anywhere that this feature will come later. 

And by knowing Tesla's timelines this might as well be 2 years away.

**""The car shifts by itself""**

Elon has tweeted a lot about how the car shifts itself and many news outlets reported on how you don't have to shift manually anymore. Now we know the car can only shift out of park by itself and this is also a **beta** feature, which is arguably one of Tesla's tricks to not have to claim liability.

You still have to shift gears to do 3 way turns or to park, using the onscreen shifter.

**The gaming capabilities**

The product page of the Model S shows the Witcher 3 and the event they demoed Cyberpunk. None of these games are in the car and there is no communication if or when they will be available.

The Product page also shows a game loaded on the rear screen. It is not possible to start games on the rear screen as of now.

**The Plaid+ cancelation**

""Plaid+ was canceled because Plaid is too good"", ""No one needs more than 400 miles"".

Both of these statements are quite dubious and it is clear that Tesla is hiding *something* here, maybe not enough orders or maybe problems with manufacturing the new cells.

TeslaMotors,feature,76kwo4,PSA: It's been 18 weeks since Tesla added a feature to AP2.,"Tesla announced AP2 to the public with the FSD demo video 361 days ago, and has been shipping hardware in cars for over a year.

Last AP2 feature was perpendicular parking on June 11th. In just 10 days, they will have gone longer with no updates than the time they went between the first AP2 feature and the last.

Missing AP1 features:

* Rain sensing wipers
* Reading speed limit signs
* Identifying different vehicle types on instrument cluster

TeslaMotors,feature,j88ffd,Feels like Tesla lacks several drivers assistance features other brands have had for years,"First of all, I love my Model 3 and would never buy another ICE car after owning it. But every time I am driving in friends vehicles, I am jealous of the inclusion of obvious safety features Tesla completely refuses to add. For such a technically advanced vehicle, it shocks me that there is no option for the following features:

\- REAL blind spot assist. My favorite implementation of this is Mercedes/Maserati with a bright red triangle in the mirror when a car is in your blind spot. Toyota and others with the orange icon are also solid. Tesla used to have an option for this to display on screen, but it was silently removed because it was implemented so poorly. Nobody wants to look at a screen while lane changing, put the indicator on the mirror where we're already looking. I know proper hardware for this (nor the mirror LED) don't exist so this can't really be added OTA.

\- Rear cross traffic alert. Warns when cars are driving perpendicular behind you when backing up. Again, no rear radars so it couldn't easily be added OTA.

\- 360 camera(!). Teslas have so many cameras it feels like this would be a no brainer. I realize there are licensing requirements for this, but come on. If Hundai can add it on their mid $20k vehicles, Tesla has no excuse.

Does anyone else feel annoyed by this? I know people have been driving for decades just fine without this safety tech, but it's a shame that not even the most expensive Teslas have ANY of these features. It bums me out to see how much development time Tesla uses to add new games but doesn't address any of these basic drivers assistance features that have existed for well over a decade.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/j88ffd/feels_like_tesla_lacks_several_drivers_assistance/,IBTRDIA,521.0,-0.7071

TeslaMotors,feature,4efscb,[Official Thread] Model S refresh and new features,"Updates:

Everything new about the updated Model S:

The front fascia and headlights of Model S now have a design similar to that found on Model X.

* Official picture: http://i.imgur.com/461fBKW.jpg

* The Tesla HEPA air filtration system which was previously only available on Model X is now available on Model S too. The filter is 100 times more effective than all other premium automotive filters removing at least 99.97% of particulate exhaust pollution and effectively all allergens, bacteria and other contaminants from cabin air.
* The standard charger in Model S is upgraded from 40 amps to 48 amps enabling faster charging when connected to higher amperage charging sources.
* Two new interior d√©cor choices: Figured Ash Wood D√©cor and Dark Ash Wood D√©cor.
* The [design studio is up](https://www.teslamotors.com/models/design?source=models-features1&redirect=no) if you want to explore it yourself.

* The price increased by $1,500 across the board. The base Model S 70 now starts at $71,500.

* It looks like the redesign increased the range without having to introduce bigger battery packs. The Model S 90D, Tesla‚Äôs vehicle with the best range, is now advertised with a range of 294 miles ‚Äì up from 288 miles.

* [New canvas going up in Richmond, Australia](https://imgur.com/MZIifXt). - [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/4efifr/new_canvas_going_up_in_richmond_australia/)

There's currently another thread up, but since it doesn't mention the redesing in the headline it's not really practical. 

I'll try to update the thread through out the day, but I feel like it's probably going to be busy at work today...

TeslaMotors,feature,58dprx,Tesla announces full autonomy hardware (AP 2.0) on all production vehicles starting now [Official Thread - Please keep all posts in here],"**All Tesla Vehicles Being Produced Now Have Full Self-Driving Hardware**
 
Self-driving vehicles will play a crucial role in improving transportation safety and accelerating the world‚Äôs transition to a sustainable future. Full autonomy will enable a Tesla to be substantially safer than a human driver, lower the financial cost of transportation for those who own a car and provide low-cost on-demand mobility for those who do not.
 
We are excited to announce that, as of today, all Tesla vehicles produced in our factory ‚Äì including Model 3 ‚Äì will have the hardware needed for full self-driving capability at a safety level substantially greater than that of a human driver. Eight surround cameras provide 360 degree visibility around the car at up to 250 meters of range. Twelve updated ultrasonic sensors complement this vision, allowing for detection of both hard and soft objects at nearly twice the distance of the prior system. A forward-facing radar with enhanced processing provides additional data about the world on a redundant wavelength, capable of seeing through heavy rain, fog, dust and even the car ahead. 

To make sense of all of this data, a new onboard computer with more than 40 times the computing power of the previous generation runs the new Tesla-developed neural net for vision, sonar and radar processing software. Together, this system provides a view of the world that a driver alone cannot access, seeing in every direction simultaneously and on wavelengths that go far beyond the human senses. 
 
Model S and Model X vehicles with this new hardware are already in production, and customers can purchase one today: https://www.tesla.com/autopilot 
 
Before activating the features enabled by the new hardware, we will further calibrate the system using millions of miles of real-world driving to ensure significant improvements to safety and convenience. While this is occurring, Teslas with new hardware will temporarily lack certain features currently available on Teslas with first-generation Autopilot hardware, including some standard safety features such as automatic emergency breaking, collision warning, lane holding and active cruise control. As these features are robustly validated we will enable them over-the-air, together with a rapidly expanding set of entirely new features. As always, our over-the-air software updates will keep customers at the forefront of technology and continue to make every Tesla, including those equipped with first-generation Autopilot and earlier cars, more capable over time.

TeslaMotors,feature,bww9zj,"Attacked by motorcyclist today, and used the Model 3 dashcam feature for first time","Today I was driving on I-880 North using the Autopilot, and I was attacked by a motorcyclist.

&#x200B;

Tesla Model 3 Dashcam feature captured the entire incident, but I found the resolution to be very low and I couldn't really read the license plate from it. I think Tesla Dashcam might not be sufficient to capture Hit & Run situation as currently is.

It was very dangerous to drive without back-mirror, so I had to open Windows, lean over, and pull the mirror back to original position. while the car in Auto-pilot.

After I got back home, I found that I can't to report it online to Highway Patrol. It is required me to go to their office physically to file any report, which is very time consuming and likely not worth it. I guess this is how those people got away with their actions.

&#x200B;

Video when the attack happen.

&#x200B;

Edit:  
I was primary want to show the video quality of Tesla Dashcam not sufficient to catch bad people, but it's pretty surprising how much people can make assumption on what happened out of nothing. I was in Auto-Pilot going straight in Carpool lane for a while. The motorcyclist just mad because his bike is very wide and have little space to pass. I also want to point that if I get into accident without rare mirror who is going to be responsible for the accident? It's an attack for me since my safety is being threatened.

Possibly activated by saying something like: ""I'm being pulled over"" in order to turn all cameras and microphones in the car, as well as put a warning on the car's display to let cops know they're being recorded from every angle","Requesting this from Tesla to protect their drivers from police abuse in traffic stops. A mode that can be activated through a voice command by saying something like: ""I'm being pulled over"", or even auto activated when the car detects it's being pulled over, all in order to activate all cameras and microphones in the car, and put a warning on the car's display to let the cops know that the car is filming them from every angle. That way they know to act like they're on camera.

This would help all drivers from abuse, not just us minority drivers. But it would aslo greatly help minority drivers like myself from abuse. Because the first time I was pulled over I had a gun pulled on me, and the officer tried to get me out of my car to search it by lying that we were on a private road, as well as threatening to shoot me for reaching for my registration like he asked me to do. Thankfully my cousin who was in the car with me called out the cops lie about the road being a private road by stating that his private school would use the road to drive to their golf practice all the time. As soon as the cop heard that, he put his gun away and ceased from his attempts to search my vehicle. Had my cousin not been there, then I would've been further harassed, or worse. 

But from watching other videos online, every race, even white people, even white lawyers can get harrased, even when filming with their phones. Filming with our phones often agitates cops, and further escalates traffic stop situations when cops often-times ask people to stop filming them, and the people filming do not comply in stopping their filming with their phones for the very well reason of their own safety. 
[Here's an example of a lawyer who was further harassed by police for filming with his phone for his own safety.](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CBKO_NgAl64/?igshid=1vwmx4rr3ao5m)


If our cars can film the cops for us, then we can say that that is just what our cars activate automatically when we're pulled over for our own safety, leading the cops to believe we have no control over the car filming them, preventing further escalation of the situation since the cops can't then ask us to stop filming them since it's the car doing it and not us. 

This would significantly drive sales too with people knowing these cars can greatly increase the chances of them not being abused, or worse, killed by police in traffic stop situations.

At least that's what I, and many others would recommend, and would feel safe with. Especiallyif your at the point of getting tortured for the shutoff pin. Of course, if it is not able to be stopped unless the traffic stop if over, then the car can just tell the cop that on the display, then the former situation is avoided.

I have tried - I really, honestly have tried to get used to the ""beta"" auto windshield wiper ""feature"" on my Model S and I have finally just turned it off and kept it that way.


I read someplace awhile ago that it was supposed to be self-adjusting and self-compensating via the ""neural net"", but I've arrived at the conclusion that it's more Elon-speak for ""vaporware"". When I activated it, the wipers turned on when there were just 3 or 4 drops of water on the windshield and it would cycle about one wiper pass every 2 or 3 seconds; but even encountering light mist they would suddenly go from an occasional wipe to full tilt, hurricane drenching speed and stayed that way.


Frankly I'm surprised that one of the enterprising young Turks out there specializing in hacking into everything electronic hasn't come up with a mod that eliminates that useless beta and replaces it with an on-screen slider that allows the driver to select his or her own appropriate windshield wiper speed.


It's obvious by now that Tesla won't do anything about this, the only thing about the car that I *really don't like* because it is **completely useless**. **TESLA**: either fix the algorithm that ""sees"" rain density on the video cameras, or drop the beta feature altogether - it's an embarrassment for an otherwise amazingly well-designed product.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ulaenv/the_beta_intermittent_wiper_feature/,anakai1,8841.0,-0.8582

TeslaMotors,feature,fapb5d,"I'll remain a fan, but as of today I'm out as an owner.","The Grand Experiment is over. After 20 months, 50,000 miles driven, a media control unit replacement, a battery replacement, and an engine replacement, last Saturday my 2015 Tesla Model S 60 gave me yet another ""battery can not charge to maximum capacity"" error (u_0018, I think) and basically left me without a working vehicle until next Friday. Couple that fried battery with yet another MCU replacement being needed (yellow banding this time, was told that no replacement unit was available for the foreseeable future), and by my estimate that is close to 30 or 40 thousand dollars in replacement parts to date, all of which have thankfully been covered under the original warranty. Additionally, having to drive to either Rockville, MD or Tysons Corner, VA to get any service done is a huge drain on time and resources, and Tesla's recent cancellation of their loaner car program along with the total inability now to actually speak to a human being on the phone for service just compounds the issue. Mobile repair is also not a thing in my area (WV), though I always get scheduled for it initially and then am rescheduled for a service center at a later date when using the app.

20 months of ownership seems like a short span for this many issues (bought it as a certified pre-owned with 30k miles), so today I called a lemon a lemon, hung up my cute little Model S key fobs, and traded that sucker in for a brand new 2020 Chevy Bolt EV. I still love Tesla and have nothing but respect for Elon Musk, but it's apparent to me that at this juncture in my life, my lifestyle and Tesla's way of doing business just aren't a good fit. Another time, perhaps.

My first EV was a 2012 Chevy Volt so I'm accustomed to that ecosystem and it won't be too much of a shock, especially given that I never paid to ""unlock"" the free for life supercharging or the autopilot features on my Tesla(the Bolt actually has way more bells and whistles than what I had previously). I commute 135 miles a day round trip and this was meant to be my daily driver, which it did admirably well when things weren't breaking. Honestly getting the S 60 was probably just too much for my range requirements; that's awfully taxing on the battery but I didn't really think about that until later and after a lot of reading but here and on the forums (full charge left me with 12-40 miles of range left after commuting home, depending on weather and driving conditions).

If it's ok with you all, I'll stick around the forum as I still love reading up on what's going on in the community. I'm a quiet lurker, I promise.

TeslaMotors,feature,djatmv,I freed my Tesla from a locked garage with Smart Summon!,"The other day I parked my Model 3 with Full Self Driving in a free shopping-tenants-only garage in San Diego while attending a work event at a space on the same block. There was nothing to say who the garage belonged to. Just a big PARK sign, a warning that parking is for customers and tenants only, and a sign on the gate saying: ""Gates locked between 11 PM - 7 AM."" There were about 30 stalls and only a few were used. It seemed legit and safe so I left it there for the day.

When I returned around 10 PM, I found the garage to be locked with sliding, full-length chain-link gates. All my co-workers were gone. Actually everyone was gone. There was absolutely no way in. All pedestrian doors were locked. I could see my car through the gate parked perpendicular and about fifty feet from the exit. I frantically searched for a security guard that might let me in, pacing around the garage for about 15 minutes. Insanity! I was losing hope and figured my only solution was to Lyft it home and back in the morning‚Äìa 60 mile round trip‚Äìif I could find one.

Then it hit me: Smart Summon.

I'd played with it a bit in parking lots and understood how it worked. Maybe if I could summon the car to the gate, the electronic sensor would open it? But would that work? And could I get the car to the sensor? And what if I couldn't? Would the car be left in some weird position in the middle of the garage, or blocking the exit? Would I end up leaving it in an even worse position where it would surely be towed first-thing in the morning?

I knew Smart Summon isn't like a remote‚ÄìI couldn‚Äôt steer it left or right, I could only make it come to me. From my experience, it didn't always come exactly where you expected, and sometimes chose a strange route to get there. But I also knew that if I could get it lined up, I could use the regular summon controls: Forward and Reverse. I would be putting a lot of trust in the car, the GPS in my phone and in the car which was indoors.

My heart was pounding, but I was desperate‚Äìand more than a little crazy.

I said a quick prayer to Elon, and launched the Smart Summon feature on my iPhone. I positioned myself directly in front of the exit gate, hoping to get a good GPS lock. It wasn't perfect, so stepped back to get a clearer satellite signal. Finally I felt it had me locked. The computed path showed how the car would back out of the stall, turn to face me, then drive straight towards me. About 50 feet of travel. It looked right.

I took a deep breath and hit summon. The car woke up. Headlights on. Reverse and brake lights on. It slowly and confidently performed the reverse-turn to face me, just like it said it would. It shifted into drive and creeped toward me. It was perfectly aligned with the exit and about three feet from the magnetic loop switch in the concrete that I hoped would trigger the gate. I couldn't believe it. This might work! I decided to switch to the regular summon feature just to make sure the car wouldn't decide to do something crazy. I pressed the FORWARD button. The car continued to inch towards me, silently, like I was gently coaxing some tentative animal to eat food from my hands. The headlights were in my eyes. It was surreal. Slowly the car reached the sensor. Would it work? It rolled further and the gate sprung to life, sliding noisily to my left! I didn't wait, I sprinted through and grabbed the drivers-side door handle. A moment later I was in the car, gate open in front of me. Sweet freedom!

I wish I had video footage. I obviously couldn't record with my phone. I checked my Teslacam feature and found the  recording feature wasn't working (a common ""595 byte file"" bug) and didn't think to hit the record button while making my escape. I'm hoping somewhere a security guard is reviewing footage of this miracle wondering what the hell they're looking at.

Thank you Tesla for this incredible feature! This isn't just about picking you up in the rain, it can legit save you from perilous situations. I never would have thought of this. I took a big gamble and it payed off big time. This car is incredible.

EDIT: Here‚Äôs a [photo of the garage](https://imgur.com/a/4pI8XKn) from the next day. The tenant I was at was on the same block and the signage was ambiguous.

However I do not for a minute believe that's where all the savings will come from.  Some of those savings will come from things like reduced features, services, quality, materials‚Ä¶etc.  We already know what some of those are, like no free supercharging, however I think there's going to be a lot more which we're going to be missing out on.

TeslaMotors,improve,helf89,"MASSIVE UPDATE! 2020.24.6 Release Notes ‚Äì No-Confirmation Green Lights, Backup Camera Improvements, & More!","A small rollout has occured for the first ""public"" release of some much-anticipated updates including No-Confirmation Green Light Control (FSD), Backup Camera Improvements, and far more. This is seemingly one of the most feature-packed updates we've gotten so far this year. You can view the full release notes [here](https://teslascope.com/teslapedia/software/2020.24.6).

Please note, many of these features are only for specific models or regions.

**Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control (Beta)**

The Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control feature no longer requires explicit driver confirmation of pushing down the gear selector to continue straight through an intersection for green traffic lights when there is a lead vehicle ahead of you and Autopilot is confident that you are not in a turn-only lane. The stop line in the driving visualization will now turn green to indicate that the car will continue through an intersection.

Please continue to pay attention and be ready to take immediate action, including braking because this feature may not stop for all traffic controls. This feature will not attempt to turn through intersections but over time, as we continue to learn from the fleet, the feature will control more naturally.

**Range Display**

Your car will now display a slightly higher range to more accurately reflect the capacity of the battery.

**Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control (Beta), (Australia, Canada, New Zealand)**

Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control is designed to recognize and respond to traffic lights and stop signs, slowing your car to a stop when using Traffic-Aware Cruise Control or Autosteer. This feature will slow the car for all detected traffic lights, including green, blinking yellow, and off lights. As your car approaches an intersection, your car will indicate the intention to slow down via a notification, slow down, and stop at the red line shown on the driving visualization.

To continue through the stop line, push down the gear selector once or briefly press the accelerator pedal to confirm that it is safe to proceed. As with all Autopilot features, you must continue to pay attention and be ready to take immediate action, including braking because this feature may not stop for all traffic controls. This feature will be conservative, slowdown often at first, and will not attempt to turn through intersections. Over time, as we learn from the fleet, the feature will control more naturally.

To enable, shift your car into PARK and tap Controls > Autopilot > Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control (Beta).

Note: When this feature is enabled, the maximum set speed while using Autosteer off highway is limited to the speed limit of the road. Before this feature can be enabled, camera calibration may be required, and the latest version of Navigation maps must be downloaded via Wi-Fi. Please refer to the Owner‚Äôs Manual for additional details about this feature.

**Driving Visualization Improvements (China)**

The driving visualization can now display additional objects which include stop lights, stop signs and select road markings. The stop sign and stop light visualizations are not a substitute for an attentive driver and will not stop the car. To see these additional objects in your driving visualization, tap Controls > Autopilot > Full Self-Driving Visualization Preview.

**Backup Camera Improvements**

You can now view video streams coming from your side repeater cameras for added visibility around the vehicle.

When the backup camera is visible, simply swipe to display the repeater camera video feeds.

**Supercharger Improvements (Model S/X, specific battery)**

Your car is now able to charge at V3 Superchargers at up to 225kW peak rates. As usual, when you navigate to a Supercharger, your car will condition its battery during the drive, so it can charge faster.

**Dashcam Viewer Improvements**

To make Sentry Mode videos easier to review, we have added a red dot along the video scrubber to indicate the moment when a Sentry Mode event was triggered. When playing a Sentry Mode video, the Dashcam Viewer will skip ahead and begin playback right before this point.

**Pay Per Use Supercharging (Korea)**

This release supports pay per use Supercharging. As usual, charging status information can be viewed by tapping the Application Launcher > Charging.

**TuneIn Improvements**

With this update, we've improved the usability and discoverability of TuneIn stations and podcasts so that it's easier to browse content. We've also added the ability to adjust playback speed of podcasts (up to 2x). As usual, to use TuneIn, tap on the media icon and select TuneIn on the source selector.

**Walk-Away Door Lock Improvements**

You now have the option to disable Walk-Away Door Lock when your vehicle is parked at Home. Tap Controls > Locks and select ""Exclude Home"".

Note: To save a home location, tap Navigate > Set Home.

**On-Route Battery Warmup**

Your vehicle will now precondition the battery when navigating to third party fast charging stations, in addition to Superchargers. As usual, you can find a list of nearby third party charging locations by tapping on the lightning bolt icon on the bottom of your touchscreen.

**Cabin Camera (Model 3/Y)**

Help Tesla continue to develop safer vehicles by sharing camera data from your vehicle. This update will allow you to enable the built-in cabin camera above the rearview mirror. If enabled, Tesla will automatically capture images and a short video clip just prior to a collision or safety event to help engineers develop safety features and enhancements in the future. As usual, you can adjust your data sharing preferences by tapping Controls > Safety & Security > DATA SHARING > Allow Cabin Camera Analytics.

Note: Cabin camera images and video clips will not be associated with your VIN to protect your privacy.

TeslaMotors,improve,q3g7uf,Flowcharts for Safety Score Beta and notes on improving Safety Score,"I've created a few flowcharts (below) to distill the information provided in the Safety Score [FAQ](https://www.tesla.com/support/safety-score) page to help understand when and where a driving event is counted for or against the Safety Score. A few notes on how to improve your score based on these diagrams and my own personal experience:

* **Forward collision warning:** All miles traveled (including on autopilot) are counted in the denominator. However, FCW events occurring while on autopilot do NOT count. I can personally verify this because I had an FCW event a few days ago while on autopilot (someone cut me off) that did not show up in my Safety Score. Like the FAQ mentions, its best to keep a safe distance to minimize the frequency of FCW events.
* **Hard braking:** Note that autopilot braking events are not counted in this metric, so it means that it's best to manually brake for traffic lights/slow traffic. I've been using an accelerometer app on my phone to better understand what it physically feels like to be slowing down at different rates. The goal is to stay in the sweet spot between 0.1 g and 0.3 g for as long as possible. It is possible to game the system by periodically slowing down while cruising along the highway but this is considered a dick move in bird culture (especially if cars are behind you), so please don't do that.
* **Aggresive turning:** This has a similar flow chart as for hard braking. Again, I've been using an accelerometer app to get a feel for cornering G forces. I've been able to use that information to calibrate how quickly I should take certain turns that I regularly encounter on my daily commute (most notably, curved highway on/off ramps). The goal is to stay in the sweet spot between 0.2 g and 0.4 g for as long as possible.
* **Unsafe following:** Again, note that autopilot following distances DO NOT COUNT. It doesn't matter what following distance you set for your autopilot. I've seen some folks set their following distances all the way to 7 after Safety Score got introduced. Just keep it where you normally would because it doesn't matter anyways. During manual driving, the goal is to stay in the sweet spot between 1 second and 3 seconds of headway for as long as possible. To game the system, I've been driving manually and following cars at a safe distance on certain stretches of highway where I would normally be using autopilot so that I can boost the denominator as much as possible. To avoid an excessive amount of cars merging/changing lanes that result in unsafe following distances, it's advisable to drive on the inner lanes as much as possible. That said, I often get dinged for unsafe following when merging into a highway via on-ramp or when I need to change into lanes with a lot of cars. If you have EAP/FSD like I do, then theoretically you can avoid these situations by using the automatic lane change functionality but I personally think that the auto lane change algorithm is overly cautious and buggy in heavy traffic and would cause me to miss my exit more than half the time.
* **Forced autopilot disengagements:** This one is pretty obvious, so there's not much to say here. Just pay attention while on autopilot.

TeslaMotors,improve,l8q4vj,"As an owner, I don't see how any owner can think Level 5 is anywhere close","Got my Model 3 in December. Paid for FSD and I don't regret it (yet). I love the car, better than anything I've driven in recent memory. Like the center screen, like the driving dynamics. Even like watching Netflix while waiting at the supercharger.

I was motivated to post this because the design of the new Model S/X seems to clearly indicate they don't actually think you'll need the steering wheel most of the time. That seems really really premature.

The existing Autopilot is not great, and I'm even starting to avoid using it out of fear of unexpected behavior. The FSD videos show similar behavior, even more unrefined, and applied in even more scenarios. Projecting forward, it's not getting better at a rate that will reach Level 5 anytime soon. At least 5 to 10 years I'd guess. ""FSD"" might get us to Level 3 if we're really lucky.

Problems:

- Phantom braking. So much of it. I drive mainly at night these days, and it now happens about once, sometimes twice every 20-40 minute drive. In the same very general section of highway, but not related to specific cars, bridges, or trucks as far as I can see. Could be any of those, or none, in some cases. Slamming on the brakes at 120 km/h in traffic is not great.
- Had it disengage mid off-ramp a few times and I had to grab the wheel to keep from slamming into a concrete barrier.
- It seems to deliberately and sometimes dramatically slow while overtaking cars in parallel lanes, causing the people behind me to slam on their brakes.
- Fast moving, but dense traffic seems to be the worst. It's not aggressive enough and confuses the people around me. Then will suddenly disengage or change speed, making the situation worse.
- Any time a lane closes or opens on a boulevard, it can't figure out where to go and swerves before disengaging.
- In moderate snow, without the Autopilot even engaged, the sensors go crazy, detecting every lump of snow on the road as an obstacle and sounding alarms constantly at speeds under 20km/h.
- Fully automated lane change is dangerous, usually wrong, erratic, and pointless.
- Not moving at the speed of traffic. Holding at 70km/h on long on-ramps for way too long, then attempting to get to 120km/h right at the end of the onramp.

If you watch FSD videos, some of this is improved, but a lot of it is not. It's mostly just the same kind of unreliable behavior in a wider array of situations.

The point of all of this is that it is not getting better very fast. And is bad enough now that I only really feel comfortable using it where I would have used cruise control in the past. Open highways, in a nearly straight line, with little traffic, and good weather. It's basically $10k cruise control. And when you add the nags, less automated than cruise control in some ways.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/l8q4vj/as_an_owner_i_dont_see_how_any_owner_can_think/,static416,16796.0,-0.9738
TeslaMotors,improve,58dprx,Tesla announces full autonomy hardware (AP 2.0) on all production vehicles starting now [Official Thread - Please keep all posts in here],"**All Tesla Vehicles Being Produced Now Have Full Self-Driving Hardware**
 
Self-driving vehicles will play a crucial role in improving transportation safety and accelerating the world‚Äôs transition to a sustainable future. Full autonomy will enable a Tesla to be substantially safer than a human driver, lower the financial cost of transportation for those who own a car and provide low-cost on-demand mobility for those who do not.
 
We are excited to announce that, as of today, all Tesla vehicles produced in our factory ‚Äì including Model 3 ‚Äì will have the hardware needed for full self-driving capability at a safety level substantially greater than that of a human driver. Eight surround cameras provide 360 degree visibility around the car at up to 250 meters of range. Twelve updated ultrasonic sensors complement this vision, allowing for detection of both hard and soft objects at nearly twice the distance of the prior system. A forward-facing radar with enhanced processing provides additional data about the world on a redundant wavelength, capable of seeing through heavy rain, fog, dust and even the car ahead. 

To make sense of all of this data, a new onboard computer with more than 40 times the computing power of the previous generation runs the new Tesla-developed neural net for vision, sonar and radar processing software. Together, this system provides a view of the world that a driver alone cannot access, seeing in every direction simultaneously and on wavelengths that go far beyond the human senses. 
 
Model S and Model X vehicles with this new hardware are already in production, and customers can purchase one today: https://www.tesla.com/autopilot 
 
Before activating the features enabled by the new hardware, we will further calibrate the system using millions of miles of real-world driving to ensure significant improvements to safety and convenience. While this is occurring, Teslas with new hardware will temporarily lack certain features currently available on Teslas with first-generation Autopilot hardware, including some standard safety features such as automatic emergency breaking, collision warning, lane holding and active cruise control. As these features are robustly validated we will enable them over-the-air, together with a rapidly expanding set of entirely new features. As always, our over-the-air software updates will keep customers at the forefront of technology and continue to make every Tesla, including those equipped with first-generation Autopilot and earlier cars, more capable over time.

TeslaMotors,improve,r2iuqb,Model 3 Fact-Finding ‚Äì Testing the Cold Weather Improvements in 2021.40.x,"The phrase ""*cold weather improvements*"" has become somewhat of a [running](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/p17rvx/software_update_beamed_from_2024/h8bqctg/) [gag](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/om4mf3/tesla_has_delivered_zero_new_software_features_in/h5izbbd/) around here ever since it appeared in [2021.4.12](https://www.notateslaapp.com/software-updates/version/2021.4.12/release-notes) and continued showing up in 2021.4.x release notes well into June/July.  If you don't know what it entailed, the biggest change was observed starting in [2021.4.11](https://www.notateslaapp.com/software-updates/version/2021.4.11/release-notes) as [increased regen in cold weather](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ly0rso/2021411_allowing_full_regen_in_cold_weather/gps5rvc/).  Compared to the [cold weather data I'd collected](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/kq39dy/model_3_factfinding_winter_edition_effects_of/gi1nq0b/?context=10000) on 2020.x firmware at the start of last winter, the changes in 2021.4.11 resulted in about [50% more regen](https://imgur.com/JY1s82K) at any given temperature & SoC, and a reduction in battery temperature required for peak regen by as much as 6¬∞C.  This combined with the [battery heating cutoffs](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/kq39dy/model_3_factfinding_winter_edition_effects_of/gi1ne0k/?context=10000) at the time meant that preconditioning your cold car simply by charging it would be enough to net you at least half regen at around 80% SoC, while preconditioning the cabin for an (albeit ample) amount of time all but guaranteed full regen was available at the start of your drive during even the coldest winter day.  Glorious times were bestowed upon all winter owners.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago and the cold temperatures are starting to creep in at nights again.  I'd started to notice the seasonal pattern of the regen bar showing dots again at the beginning of drives despite my usual charging to 80% and preconditioning habits.  A new feature in the upcoming [2021.40 release notes](https://www.notateslaapp.com/software-updates/version/2021.40/release-notes) caught my eye:

> Cold Weather Improvements
> 
> You can now enable front defrost and maintain your climate settings when clearing ice and snow. As usual, tap the fan icon and select Keep Climate On when parked.
> 
> **Additionally, when using climate controls on the Tesla App, automatic battery pre-conditioning has been optimized to consume less energy.**

Optimized to consume less energy?.  But my car's the 2018 version of Model 3 without the heatpump, it generates [waste heat in the stators](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/kq39dy/model_3_factfinding_winter_edition_effects_of/gi1n9sq/) to heat the coolant loop and then run the warm coolant through the battery.  Surely no such means of optimization exists beyond just lowering the heater cutoff temperature, I pondered.  So I set out to measure the change, and that's exactly what they did.

[For reference, here's the heating curve from late last year on 2020.44.10](https://i.imgur.com/1V6a0YZ.png) (before the regen increase).  Heating the battery by preconditioning the cabin resulted in a battery heater cutoff temperature of around 19-20¬∞C and a final stabilized pack temperature of about 22-23¬∞C.  In addition to the power consumed heating in the cabin, the battery heating mechanism in the stators consumes 7 kW in my dual-motor car and, after an initial few minutes of warming up motors and coolant loop, heats my [480 kg](https://cleantechnica.com/2018/07/08/tesla-model-3-chevy-bolt-battery-packs-examined/) LR battery pack at a steady 9.75¬∞C every 15 minutes.  This means that a car left to cold-soak at around the freezing point used to take about 30-35 minutes to precondition the battery and consume 3.5-4.1 kWh in the process (not including the power to heat the cabin).

[When measured a couple weeks ago on 2021.36 firmware](https://i.imgur.com/8ytMcKW.png), the heating curve cutoff temperature had dropped to around 13-14¬∞C and final average pack temperature stabilized around 17-18¬∞C, approximately 5¬∞C lower than it was on last year's firmware, but owing to the increased regen profile from 2021.4.11 this optimization shaves about 7.5 minutes and 0.9 kWh off of the previous battery preconditioning energy consumption behavior from a year ago (assuming you let your car fully precondition) with no noticeable decrease in regen availability.  

[When measured again on 2021.40.6 firmware](https://i.imgur.com/90xftKt.png), the heating curve cutoff temperature is now around 7-8¬∞C and stabilizes at around 10-11¬∞C.  This further optimization is an additional 6-7¬∞C drop in cutoff temperature and roughly saves an additional 9 minutes and 1.1 kWh for the car to consider the battery fully conditioned, however this time it results in noticeably less available regen for the battery to be capable of accepting.  Heating speed and power consumption of the PTC cabin heater remains unchanged.  

Anecdotally, in testing immediately after applying the latest firmware I observed noticeably weakened regen when slowing down from highway speeds the first time, with the regen bar dots indicating I was still only getting around half of maximum regen even after 15 minutes of preconditioning and 30 minutes of highway driving.  It was still a manageable experience but required unanticipated application of physical brakes since my estimation of stopping distance was not yet calibrated to the new behavior.  

Reliably strong and consistent regen braking behavior is the utopia of the one-pedal driving experience, and with the previous preconditioning curves of 2021.36 I feel that Tesla had it just right for cold weather optimization.  With this latest optimization I believe they shot a little too low in the name of saving energy and we've lost some of that consistency that came with preconditioning your car in cold weather.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/r2iuqb/model_3_factfinding_testing_the_cold_weather/,Wugz,28950.0,0.9934

[**New Tesla Model S Now the Quickest Production Car in the World**](https://www.tesla.com/blog/new-tesla-model-s-now-quickest-production-car-world)
 
The Model S P100D with Ludicrous mode is the third fastest accelerating production car ever produced, with a 0-60 mph time of 2.5* seconds. However, both the LaFerrari and the Porsche 918 Spyder were limited run, million dollar vehicles and cannot be bought new. While those cars are small two seaters with very little luggage space, the pure electric, all-wheel drive Model S P100D has four doors, seats up to 5 adults plus 2 children and has exceptional cargo capacity. 
 
The 100 kWh battery also increases range substantially to an estimated 315 miles on the EPA cycle and 613 km on the EU cycle, making it the first to go beyond 300 miles and the longest range production electric vehicle by far. 
 
The larger battery pack is also available on the Model X, making the world‚Äôs quickest SUV even faster. Model X P100D with Ludicrous mode accelerates to 60 mph in 2.9* seconds and travels up to 289 miles EPA and 542 km EU on a single charge. Model X is also a pure electric SUV and can seat up to seven adults. 
 
Model S and Model X are engineered to be the safest cars on the road and to have the highest ratings from NHTSA. Both have access to the Tesla Supercharger network for the freedom to travel long distance for free. And every Tesla will improve over time with free over the air upgrades.

Tesla customers who have ordered a P90D Ludicrous, but not taken delivery, can upgrade to the 100 kWh pack for $10,000. Existing P90D Ludicrous owners can also upgrade to a 100 kWh pack, but for $20,000, as their used 90 kWh pack will have to be recycled. 

While the P100D Ludicrous is obviously an expensive vehicle, we want to emphasize that every sale helps pay for the smaller and much more affordable Tesla Model 3 that is in development. Without customers willing to buy the expensive Model S and X, we would be unable to fund the smaller, more affordable Model 3 development.

TeslaMotors,improve,cbj6ws,I bought a Tesla at 24 and it‚Äôs improved my quality of life tremendously. Best investment I‚Äôve made so far.,"I‚Äôm curious to hear other people‚Äôs stories about why they got a Tesla. Here‚Äôs mine:

A couple months ago, I landed a new job with great growth potential and much better pay - with the downside that my commute would now be 2 hours each way. (Now before some of you ask me why I didn‚Äôt just move closer for the job, it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm already committed to my current living situation so I have no plans to move this year.) I thought I could handle the commute because my old job had a one hour commute so I thought, hey what‚Äôs another hour? But nope, that second hour really puts a toll on you mentally and physically. Do not recommend. 

For the first month of the job, I was driving an old 2009 Mercedes that was a total gas guzzler. (This was only a temporary situation though because I was just borrowing my sisters car while she was away, since my lease had just ended and I was debating what my next car should be.) Anyways, I had to fill up twice a week and with the crazy gas prices in California, it was costing me over $500 for just gas expenses alone.

On top of that, I felt like my quality of life was just going down. I would be sitting in bumper to bumper traffic at like 8 pm when all I wanted to do was go home and relax. I started to feel so defeated because it was like my entire day was over by the time I got back. I could only muster the energy to eat dinner, shower, and go straight to bed. 

So I finally had enough and I decided to start looking into new cars. I had a vague idea of what I wanted, ideally an EV because:
A. I‚Äôve been getting more environmentally conscious lately
B. Gas prices are insane and I hate going to get it tbh, it‚Äôs my least favorite chore
C. Lots of incentives for EV drivers which would make my commute easier (like the carpool stickers)
D. Rebates and the tax incentive

I first started looking at other cars actually, because I didn‚Äôt think I could realistically own a Tesla. But after researching and finding out that the other electric cars out there just couldn‚Äôt compare with the superior features and performance of a Tesla, and the price gap wasn‚Äôt significantly huge, I decided to take the leap and start the ordering process. 

So fast forward to today, I‚Äôve had my Tesla for about two months now and I‚Äôve been loving every single minute of it. The autopilot does wonders for me. It takes like 90% of the stress and exhaustion out of my drive. I feel a lot happier now and feel more motivated to do other things after work.

TeslaMotors,improve,cxhh9y,M3 Blind Side Detection is dissapointing and should be improved with a software update,"Is it just me or has anybody else actually started to shoulder check **more** after getting the Model 3?

The side mirror is too small to put a mini mirror on, and the screen has too much delay for it to be a replacement to shoulder checking.

This seems like an extremely easy to fix with a software update that turns on blind side cameras and show them on the screen as soon as you turn a blinker on. Kind of how it does it with the reverse camera already when you got into reverse. There are already many cars out there with that feature.

What do you guys think? TBH this has been my only issue with the M3. Everything else has been exceeding my expectations

TeslaMotors,improve,raatcy,FSD 10.6 improvements,"Definite improvement over 10.5. Some notable updates in driving on my regular routes:

1. On a 4 lane highway where center divider becomes the left turn lane both directions: Unprotected left with oncoming car also making an unprotected left. Waited appropriately and correctly tracked the velocities of the oncoming cars as they disappeared behind behind the vehicles waiting to take their left turns. I had a tough time personally keeping track of all the oncoming cars, but FSD did so correctly. This was a scenario where 10.4 and 10.5 would either wait too long or try to jump infront of oncoming traffic. 

2. Right hand turn onto the same highway where the ‚Äúcurb‚Äù is a painted white line with cross hatching to denote ‚Äúno man‚Äôs land‚Äù. 10.4 and 10.5 would be very indecisive about where to drive and would weave into the hatching. Turn wasn‚Äôt very smooth, but it picked the correct line this time. 

3. Reduced spouse/passenger nag triggers: Micro braking is still happening, but this version it is a slight/momentary lift off of the accelerator instead of a full lift/regen brake. 

4. Stopping at the stop signs actually stops in the right place. Even on assertive in residential areas it still waits too long to actually make the go determination when things are clear.

5. Unmapped and recent road reconfigurations are a challenge for it. It didn‚Äôt know how to do the controlled left across 3 lanes, despite some markings being present.

I tried using Tasker to automatically toggle my phone Bluetooth off and on twice a day. That didn't seem to make a difference. Then I tried something a couple of days ago, and I haven't had a failure in the dozen or so times I opened the car since. 

Here is what I did: go to Settings->Battery. On the three vertical dots in the top right corner, pick Battery optimization. In the dropdown on top, pick All apps. Find your Tesla app and click on it. Select ""Don't optimize"" and click Done. 

It looks like the phone key fails if the Tesla app is killed by the OS. This prevents that -- and so far it looks like it works!

TeslaMotors,improve,wsl6fg,MCU2 upgrade improves audio quality for bass heads,"2016 S P90D finally pulled the trigger on the MCU1 to MCU2 upgrade as a treat for myself.

I'd never read anywhere that the MCU2 upgrade included new audio processing. Bass response is better all around IMO, and appreciate the new slider for ""immersive sound"" replacing the old Dolby audio. The equalizer now has a slider for ""sub"" which, by the sound of rough testing on the highway, has the most influence over <35Hz frequencies. I'll update later when I'm not cruising at 70mph

Wanted to post this info for any other bass enthusiasts who might be considering the upgrade. Dropped car off at 8AM, was done by about noon

Edit: had some time to play. Over Bluetooth with the latest updates, the ""sub"" slider functions as an additional gain or attenuation for frequencies under about 50Hz. My sub only responds down to 27Hz so couldn't test below that.

TeslaMotors,improve,gymbb3,Things in the UI (Model 3) that annoys me or could be improved on,"This is just a short list of things that I feel could be improved. All of it in the UI so it could be done over the air. Maybe some of them I am just using wrongly? If so, please tell me how to use it correctly. 

##Autopilot speed limit

Whenever it ""knows"" the speed limit, it limits itself to being used at that speed. I can also change it to +10 in the settings on ""relative"" and 200++ on absolute. However, most of the time, it's still limiting itself to the speed limit (+10). 

It's all nice and well when that is the correct limit, but often, it is not. There are huge parts of the roads in my country that have been under construction for a long time. So the limit, from map data, was set to 70. But now it's complete and should be 90. But the car wont let me do 90. So for really long parts of the roads, I just can't use the full features. What is weird, is that sometimes it allows me to set whatever value I want, no matter the speed limit. But most of the time, it refuses to do more than the speed limit (+10).

_Simply let me set whatever I want, and the problem would be gone._


##Setting a lower cruise speed

As far as I know, the only way to set the cruise speed at something _lower_ than the speed limit, is to set it, and then scroll down to whatever I want. But that's just not doable when it thinks speed limit is 80++, but it actually is 50--. It's just too much to scroll, and the car goes into a weird accelerate then break motion. 

I have noted that if I keep applying the throttle while setting the speed, it won't do anything before I release the throttle. But I just feel that is a hard/overly complex way to do it.

_Simply allow me to scroll down the cruise speed before applying._


##Navigation box 

Whenever I am using the navigation, a ""small"" information box will appear in the top left part of the map part of the screen. And I mean, part of the point of using navigation, is to have that information there. But I feel it is often more in the way than actually helpful. I don't need to know that in 30-60 minutes, I am to turn left. 

It becomes a small ""problem"" when the road I am to follow, banks to the left. It becomes hidden behind the information box. I mean, it's not too much of a ""problem"", but it would be nice to have the option to just hide it without turning of navigation. Or maybe move it to the lower part of the screen. I wouldn't mind if it covered parts of the road that are now behind me. 

##Auto screen colours

As far as I am aware, the screen changes from day to night mode on a certain time of day, not with the current ambient lighting. In my country, _a lot_ of driving happens underneath the sea or inside the mountain. And the sun has no effect on anything. It would be nice to have it enter night mode when entering tunnels. And even more important, turning into day mode when exiting. 

I can set it manually to night mode when going trough tunnels, however, if I don't set it to day mode before exiting, I will find myself in the situation where there is so much sunlight, the screen will just look entirely black. 

Just have the light sensors trigger day/night mode on the screen. It already triggers the front lights nicely, just make it work on the screen too. 

##Using available information from radio channels

Radio stations don't just broadcast audio. They also send other data like text and images. My VW Golf from 2013 would display this information. Loads of other cars probably do too. But not Tesla. Just take the information and display it.

And while talking about radio, it would be nice if the channel list would show what type of radio a station is. Is it AM, FM or DAB+ ? (I don't think Model 3 can receive AM, but still).

##General customization

It would just be nice to be able to customize the UI a bit for personal preference. Maybe I want to have a small graph of the power usage? Maybe someone wants to have the reverse camera available all the time? Maybe you have weird setups that would fit you better? Other cars have the option to select from different setups, or customize their own. 
And it kinda feels lacking in Tesla. 

##Current SoC range map

I noted that on the VW electric cars, there is a nice little feature where it will show you every part of the map you could possibly hope to reach with the current SoC. It would just be a cool little app to have.

##Clickable status icons

Clicking the battery brings you into the charger menu. That is nice. 

But why not just implement some other clickable icons too? Need to manually change the lights? Just press the position of the light status icons. To activate fog lights. Or turn on the driving lights. 

Or if you want to swap between % and km range, kmh/mph, C/F. Just make it a double tap command. No need to enter the menu to change things when there are only 2 options. ON/OFF...

TeslaMotors,improve,bz3mpu,The company won't survive if they don't improve delivery.,"This subreddit is pro-Tesla. I used to be one of them. I get this post will be met with downvotes, but this needs to be said. I loved Nikola and what he stood for back in his war vs Edison. I love Elon and his vision. But actually buying a Tesla made me lose faith in the company, here is why:

Sales, sleazy like the rest:

Show gallery was painless. Driving the car was cool (I knew I was going to buy so I made their job easy). The sales advisor gave me a quote for my trade in before I bought. But the delivery advisor won't honor it. So basically sales advisor mislead me to get me to buy, reminds me of any sleazy used car salesman.

Delivery advisor turnover:

With the frequency my delivery advisors get back to me, you'd think I'm collecting their credit card debt, not trying to give them money. I had to switch advisors because I changed delivery locations. The second advisor literally returned 0 of my 10 calls or emails. 4 weeks later I found out that he no longer works with the company. I had to call the sales gallery to move forward on my delivery. If this guy quits. Shouldn't be email get forwarded to someone else?? A 38Billion (lowered recently) market cap company doesn't have a process in place to return my emails about delivery if there is a delivery advisor turnover?!?!? I wonder how many people they aren't delivering to because of delivery advisor turnover.

Lack of training for new delivery advisors:

I get they are pushing for a Q2 goal. They probably hired a tons of new help for just meeting that goal. One of the reasons I took delivery a little later was because I wanted HW3 on my build. So when I was assigned my VIN for my delivery, I called to verify my car had HW3 installed. ""I haven't heard anything about a hardware 3 or FSD computer on the Tesla intranet. We don't have that"". ""We don't give you your purchase agreement until you take delivery"" (I need a purchase agreement for my financial institution to transfer funds, so I can pay for the car before delivery‚Ä¶ catch 22 huh??) It took me 3 hours and 5 calls to get through to him that I wasn't lying about hardware 3 or the purchase agreement.

Sales computer system stuck in the 90s:

I still haven't paid for my car. The reason the purchase agreement didn't generate is that their online portal where I entered the financial institution info DOES NOT communicate with their internal sales portal. I called 3 times today just to repeat the financial institution information that I filled out 3 days ago. However, the delivery advisors can't access their own sales portal either. So I STILL do not have a purchase agreement or guarantee of title. I called them again 6 hours later and they stated that I won't be getting a purchase agreement despite giving them all the info for the 2nd time today.

I am determined to get my model 3, I will buy another Y or the truck in a few years for my parents. But how many are left that are willing to churn through bad experiences to get a car? Any one of the above points is enough to push a qualified buyer towards a competitor. The average American doesn't have the will/expertise/patience to churn through these experiences. ~~The frustrating part is that it will cost trivial amount from Tesla to fix these problems.~~ This company won't survive if they don't fix the problems.

&#x200B;

Edit: as someone below points out, the cost is not trivial.

Edit 2: I had the email of the sales advisor telling me my trade in would be $1k higher than the official trade in. I'm not making this up as what i think i deserve. I was quoted a price by Tesla sales. To those of you that say I should have used the official trade in system: the sales advisor sat me down on his computer and showed me a number. On top of that, he emailed me the number again!! All this happened BEFORE I placed my deposit!! He mislead me on purpose to get the sale. And I did not know there was a trade in system until after I placed my deposit. 

Edit 3: Truth be told. I think the company will survive. I sincerely hope it does. I am asking officially for the mods to rename the thread to ""Delivery issues are not helping persuade new buyers"" or else Tesla will die.

Update: I have obtained the Guarantee of Title and MVPA. I could totally see how this process would be super easy if I didn't have the above issues.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/bz3mpu/the_company_wont_survive_if_they_dont_improve/,DavidChenghz,7075.0,0.9956

TeslaMotors,improve,d85a1o,A Pilot‚Äôs Thoughts on Tesla‚Äôs Autopilot,"After months of hemming and hawing on whether or not I should sell my existing ride to get a Tesla, I finally made the leap to the modern era.  I purchased a P3D-, and while I didn‚Äôt need FSD for my daily commute, I sprung for the option for the sake of being a part of the Tesla autonomy experience.  To christen the vehicle, we decided to take it on a family road trip to the mountains, crossing through a few cities on the way.  While driving, I noticed many similarities to air travel and figured it would be fun to make some comparisons here for those who were interested.  More specifically, I‚Äôd like to discuss autopilot methods, human factors, and traffic deconfliction.    

Autopilot uses modes that guide a modern aircraft along lateral (LNAV) and vertical (VNAV) navigation paths, defined by either ground based navigation aids or Global Navigation Satellite Systems.   LNAV and Tesla‚Äôs autopilot are pretty similar in function.  LNAV by itself can be used to direct an aircraft left and right using assigned/desired headings or to follow planned courses of flight, whereas Tesla‚Äôs autopilot uses the vehicle‚Äôs sensors to follow the highways along its route of travel. 

It‚Äôs essential in both cases to monitor the autopilot system, especially in challenging conditions. These conditions can be either environmental (weather, road conditions) or involve human factors (fatigue, activities other than strictly steering the vehicle).  Generally speaking, in aircraft with a crew, there‚Äôs a pilot flying (PF) and a pilot monitoring (PM), and the PM‚Äôs job is to back up the PF.  Both are watching and listening for the annunciators that might indicate a fault or failure with the system, in which case they would work together to troubleshoot and restore function or resort to hand-flying the aircraft.  In cases where the PF transfers PF duties to the current PM, it‚Äôs important to confirm the level of automation so that both pilots are on the same sheet of music.  I‚Äôve seen instances where a PF is hand-flying the aircraft and has it trimmed so well that it feels like autopilot is engaged.  The other pilot might assume automation is hooked up until the aircraft starts to list to the side or lose a little bit of altitude‚Ä¶and by this point, they‚Äôd hopefully recognize the error, rectify the situation, and discuss it during debrief.  

I observed something similar to this on our road trip.  The Tesla was approaching an area where the highway gained another lane.  What I had repeatedly observed already was that the Model 3 would recognize the single lane widening, try to stay evenly spaced between the edges of the widening road, suddenly recognize a dashed line in front of it as the two-lane section began, and then swerve to the left (towards oncoming traffic) to establish itself in the inside lane.  As we approached this scenario, I disengaged autopilot and made the transition myself.  The tone sounded, the visuals changed, and I was ‚Äúhand driving‚Äù - a natural transition I‚Äôd experience in an airplane.  However, it was late in the day, I was a little fatigued, and I was enjoying some mountain scenery‚Ä¶so after the transition, my brain went back to ‚Äúautopilot mode‚Äù, but the Model 3 didn‚Äôt.  The car started drifting, and I could feel the lane departure safety feature gently steer my car away from the edge.  When I sensed this occurring, I recognized my error, returned the car to the center of the lane, and switched autopilot back on.  My wife was asleep so I had nobody to chide me except myself!  I appreciate the automatic safety features the car has, since many travelers won‚Äôt have a ‚ÄúPM‚Äù to back them up if they‚Äôre ever fatigued or distracted.  

Speaking of fatigue, autopilot greatly reduces fatigue and can extend the working day of pilots significantly.  When I travel with a full crew, we‚Äôre capable of a 24-hour flying work day (rotating pilots through the bunk to sleep).  However, if the pitch axis of the autopilot stops functioning, we‚Äôre limited to 16 hours.  Crossing the ocean while constantly making small corrections can be exhausting and increase the likelihood for errors.  I found that after a full day of driving across the great plains states I wasn‚Äôt nearly as tired as I would be driving my ICE vehicle (I know some ICE vehicles have smart cruise control/lane keeping, but mine doesn‚Äôt).  Sitting there and monitoring the car was much more pleasant than making constant adjustments for 12 hours!

Lastly (and bear with me on this one), modern aircraft in conjunction with ATC use [Automatic Dependent Surveillance](https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/programs/adsb/) (more specifically, functions within ADS-B like [TIS-B](https://www.aopa.org/news-and-media/all-news/2017/may/flight-training-magazine/how-it-works-adsb)) and [Traffic Collision Avoidance System](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_collision_avoidance_system) (TCAS) Mode S to gain information on proximity aircraft for purposes of sequencing and deconfliction.  This information contains data on aircraft altitude, speed, vector, etc. which can be transferred from airplane to airplane.  Some of this data is visible to operators (TIS-B data), while some isn‚Äôt (Mode S).  In the case of Mode S, two aircraft who are converging on collision courses, who are both equipped with properly functioning Mode S transponders, will be issued directional commands by their systems in order to deconflict their paths and restore a safe buffer between the jets.  

Now, in the case of a Tesla, there are no explicit systems like TIS-B and TCAS/Mode S because every car would have to contain the required systems for it to work.  Instead, the car‚Äôs sensors detect traffic around them to make decisions like braking and merging.  I‚Äôm not sure of the fidelity of the radar and other components, but from what I‚Äôve seen, they can be clumsy - especially in medium-traffic situations (or anything requiring merging with congestion).  The benefit of a system that passes exact data between all vehicles is the car can make the most informed decision for precise and smooth maneuvering.  Precise targeting radars in military applications can also gain lots of data on other vehicles, but again, I‚Äôm not sure of the quality of data a Tesla is capable of gaining.  Either way, both should be capable of determining relative movement of nearby vehicles at a rate and accuracy far superior to human ability.

If you‚Äôve made it this far, thanks for reading my thoughts on the car‚Äôs systems as a new Tesla owner.  What‚Äôs nice is that Tesla has a wealth of information from the aviation industry in both its successes and failures to continually improve upon the autonomous abilities of the fleet.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/d85a1o/a_pilots_thoughts_on_teslas_autopilot/,TheDoughGothamKneads,4221.0,0.9972

TeslaMotors,improve,wis9y5,Aero Wheels Range Improvement for SR vs. LR,"I can't help but notice the Model 3 SR with 18"" Aero Wheels only has a 5-mile range improvement over one with 19"" Sport Wheels (272 mi. vs. 267 mi. per EPA; a 1.9% increase), whereas the Model 3 LR with Aero Wheels has 24 miles increased range over the same motor with Sport Wheels (358 mi. vs 334 mi; a 7.2% increase).

This is puzzling to me as an aerospace engineering student. Both the SR and LR seem to be identical externally so their aerodynamics should be the same with the respective wheels. One difference I can think of is the added weight of the battery in the LR. Intuitively, the heavier/bigger battery vehicle should be more resistant to drag (drag is constant but accounts for a smaller fraction of the total balanced force) as the LR probably exerts more force. I appreciate any help in understanding this disparity.

TeslaMotors,improve,xy76ln,Would anyone else like to see significant FSD visualization improvements prioritized?,"The FSD visualization seems to be showing the instantaneous ""frame by frame"" interpretation of the world by the AI.  While this is interesting to see, from what I understand there are now many other layers of inference in the system including object persistence and likely position calculation, before driving decisions are made.

I think cleaning up the visualization of FSD would be hugely beneficial in instilling more confidence in the driver that the system better knows what the ""real world"" looks like.  The current display with constantly flickering lines, objects, people, locations is truly disconcerting - have you ever driven by a truck and seen how much the position of that truck jumps around in the display?

TeslaMotors,improve,c0e6oz,How Owning a Tesla Changed My Life,"Many of us here talk about the features of our cars, the newest firmware update, the little problems (and sometimes big), and nuances of owning and driving a Tesla.  But I want to shift the conversation for just a moment and speak to how owning a Tesla has impacted my life as a whole.  I emphatically encourage anyone else here to share your story, good or bad, as well.  So here goes...

&#x200B;

I commute about 3 hours a day in heavy LA traffic.  Next to NYC, it's probably the most grueling nightmare of lane changes, starting and stopping, praying to the Gods of Sidestreets that you can make it home with a fraction of your sanity still intact in the US.  The HOV lanes are a small reprieve at times, but often just as congested as the regular ones.  On any given day, most of us that live here probably in jest wish for a quick death to end it all just so we don't have to sit in another hour of traffic; yet somehow we prevail to drive another day.  We drove our dumb cars, in dumb traffic, with dumb people, and even dumber gas prices.  This was our plight, and yet we were resigned to it, even though with every breathe we said ""Dear Lord, why me?  What did I do to deserve this?""  We returned home fatigued, haggard, with barely enough energy to cook a good meal for ourselves or our families.  We fell asleep during movie night with our significant others because the road took what life we had left in us at the end of a long work day.

&#x200B;

Then Tesla came around and offered me an alternative.  While not perfect by any means it was light years better than what I'd ever experienced.  I've driven all sorts of beaters in my life, but my last was not what one would consider an uncomfortable car to drive.  My old 335d dutifully got me from point A to B while trying it's best to smooth the bumps in the road, however it was still a comparably a dumb car despite it's price tag.  When that car caught fire and burned to the ground because of a recall issue, I vowed to be brave and try something different.  Out of this wanderlust came my Model 3 LR AWD; a technological marvel.  I work in tech and can discern what's good and just mediocre.  From day one hopping into the frying pan of traffic and enabling the AP, I found a freedom I never knew before.  Throughout the long stretch of the 405 in LA it did nearly all the heavy lifting.  It kept me safe by ensuring I was the proper distance behind traffic to avoid rear ending someone, which is sometimes a challenge because of a vision depth perception issue I have with my eyes.  I no longer awoke in the morning dreading the day, the drive to and from work.  I trusted that this car, quiet, efficient, safe and smart would deliver me to my job and allow me to work to my full potential.  By the end of the day I immediately noticed that I had the energy and mental acuity to better tackle my tasks as a father and husband at home.  Even though it's been only a couple months of owning a Tesla Model 3 the nights where I told my daughter I was too exhausted to play Shopkins with her, or tell my wife that I didn't have the energy to cook us a good dinner is a thing of the past.  I'm so much happier now, and so are the people around me that I love the most.  Yes, there are sometimes little glitches.  Sure, sometimes service has lagged when I needed it.  But all in all, if I had to slap down the same amount of cash down on a car I'd buy this one again in a heartbeat.  I have the deepest amount of gratitude to Tesla for what it's given back to me; my life.  I have faith that it will only continue to get better over time with Full Self Driving, OTA updates, and improved service.  But what it's given thus far is so much, and means the world.  I never expected or thought that something as simplistic as a car could have such a deep impact on my life, but when it comes to my family and my ability to have what I need at the end of the day to give them what they are worth, it means everything.

TeslaMotors,improve,6dfd19,When will Tesla support CarPlay and Android Auto and otherwise improve the interior car computer?,"Tesla is about to launch their most important product, the mass-market Model 3. People who are buying the 3 will not be your typical early adopter like the buyers of the Model S, who have been willing to ignore the fact that the S lacks a lot of creature comforts found in the luxury models offered by BMW, Mercedes, and Audi.

However with the launch of 3, the increasingly outdated and poor feature set of the interior car computer and center console screen is going to be something that a lot more people will be experiencing and it simply does not hold up well against the offerings from even extremely cheap cars sold by the ordinary American, Japanese, and European carmakers.

Things that Tesla needs to have implemented ASAP, like I don't know before the 3 launches:

(1) Android Auto and CarPlay. 

https://www.android.com/auto/

https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/available-models/

Pretty much everyone is on board with CarPlay and Android Auto. Except Tesla. This is made more irritating by the fact that the built-in apps like Google Maps are increasingly outdated and feature-poor, since they don't get updated nearly as much as the apps in your phone. It also makes simple things like media playback from your phone to your car more aggravating than it really should be in cars which are billed as the most advanced on the road today.

(2) Media player overhaul.

I realize that a lot of people insist on using the built-in media player in their car instead of streaming their music collection from their phones. Well, the media player sucks. We all know it sucks. Elon knows it sucks. So why isn't it being improved? I can't possibly imagine that Tesla cannot spare like 1-2 developers to work exclusively on the media player and other built-in apps in the car, especially since those wouldn't be the devs working the Autopilot or something to begin with.

(3) Bluetooth support for AptX from Android devices.

My separate thread about this lives here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/69c56q/why_doesnt_teslas_bluetooth_support_aptx/

In general, the Bluetooth on Teslas is kind of crummy. People complain about it refusing to reconnect properly all the time. Also it needs high quality music playback from Android. This isn't optional. I don't care if Elon only owns iPhones and probably hasn't touched an Android device in his life. This is not acceptable and will not be acceptable when the 3 becomes widely available and more than just Apple users in California own Teslas.

(4) Automatic volume leveling based on speed.

This is a pretty common feature in cars now from the $10k price point to the $100k price point. To put it quite simply, the car automatically adjusts the volume of music based on how fast you are going, which is rather nice. It's also kind of nice when the car automatically starts your music at a lower volume when you get in and leave instead of blasting your ears at the highway volume you had it set to when you got out earlier.

(5) Navigation

This is a big one, since one of the primary competitive advantages of Teslas over other long range EVs is the Supercharger network. Google Maps does not show Superchargers and doesn't route cars through them. This is mainly a Google problem but since Elon apparently hasn't ever touched an Android device in his entire life he doesn't seem to realize this. It needs to be addressed. But the other problem is the built-in nav system which does have Superchargers is based on Garmin or something and isn't updated regularly. So you have to choose between Google Maps which is up to date but doesn't send you through Superchargers, or the built-in nav which has Superchargers but is typically at least a year out of date because it updates like a conventional standalone GPS dash-mounted package that is only manually installed once a year because those devices operate offline.

(6) Misc. Apps

Well, we know the media player is trash. The built-in browser is slow as molasses and outdated too. The radio is regularly criticized for being slow to change stations, and starting with the 3 people are going to be buying Teslas who actually still listen to terrestrial broadcast AM/FM radio. Honestly, I feel like there is no one working on app development full-time at all in Tesla and that will not be a very good thing soon now. But again, a lot of the problems with the built-in apps would be rendered moot if Tesla would just support Android Auto and CarPlay.

I feel like I wrote a lot more than I meant to. But this is stuff that needs to be addressed before Tesla transitions from the tiny market of $100k+ ultra-luxury cars to the mass market of $35k cars. There is much more competition in the $35k space and most people will not be as willing to give up things just to buy an EV which should be treated as fundamental in the mass market as they would when they are early adopters of cars mainly sold to the rich.

Also, I sincerely hope and pray that the 3 will come with enough cupholders for all 5 people who will be seated in the car. That shit will not fly in the $35k mass market. It's a miracle that Tesla was able to get away with only 2 cupholders in a $100k+ car as long as they did, but the early adopters are always more forgiving than the mass market.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/6dfd19/when_will_tesla_support_carplay_and_android_auto/,unknown_soldier_,61588.0,0.9829
TeslaMotors,improve,dcasmq,Underrated: v10 AP improvements on local non-divided roads,"As an owner of a MCU1, HW2.5 Model X, my biggest joy from v10 has been the improvements to AP behavior, especially outside of highways.

I didn‚Äôt get the fancy games and video streaming. Enhanced summon is still in parlor-trick category for me, it being a first beta release. But man, has AP been a huge improvement:

1. Car anticipates tight curves and slows down reliably where it didn‚Äôt use to. Some curves it did, but most I had to slow down myself. No longer an issue.

2. The pick up speed from stopped state is now human-like so I no longer have to cajole it with extra acceleration.

3. No more dancing car animations.

4. Better visualization of double yellow line and other vehicles. Feel more confident about what the car sees and doesn‚Äôt.

5. Much smoother and natural stop when approaching stopped traffic.

I still haven‚Äôt ever seen the red-light detection UI so not sure if it works in my config. Nor has it fixed incorrect reading/assumptions of speed limits in certain sections.

But all in all, very happy with AP and can‚Äôt wait to try it on highways and see how much NOAP has improved. It‚Äôs not FSD but a lot of my driving has shifted to AP even when running local errands.

TeslaMotors,improve,wjj02l,FSD Lane Change Turn Signal Feature Improvement Idea,"Edit: Sounds like I messed up and forgot what it was like to have lane changes with confirmation on. I have confirmation off, which means it will make the lane change unless you cancel. But, it seems to require sensing your resistance on the wheel to continue.

When FSD decides to make a lane change, depending on your settings, you have to either confirm the turn, or make sure your hand presence is known on the wheel before it automatically does the turn.

When the lane change is initiated, the car displays the then externally (flashing light). This doesn't make sense to me, because of two reasons:

1. If you cancel lane change
- Imagine driving behind a car that keeps putting it's turn signal on then back off. That is confusing.
2. The turn signal is on for too long
- IMO, because it takes time to either approve the lane change or make sure your hand is present on the wheel, the signal is one for far too long. I think it should turn on once it is approved and ready to start the change.

My suggestion is to keep the internal clicking noise of the turn and internal UI display of the turn signal, but suppress the external display of the turn. This seems great; to the driver it is obvious the turn is occurring, but to the external view it is not making a lane change until the lane change is approved.

Obv this doesn't apply to driver-initiated lane changes",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/wjj02l/fsd_lane_change_turn_signal_feature_improvement/,BlueJ173,189.0,0.9822
TeslaMotors,improve,alt8v2,[Discussion] On the call Musk said they don‚Äôt plan to use 2170 Cells in the Model S/X. I am no expert on batteries. Could they just repackage the older cells better and get improved range? Or is this a sign that they may have an even newer cell type that will go into the S/X?,"If you change the chemical make up would the cell type (2170) change or is that just the name of the ‚Äúcanister‚Äù?

Tesla is still at the top of the heap for range so maybe they just don‚Äôt care yet about more mileage till Rivian or other get their act together?

My hunch is they have a newer cell coming out that will go into the S/X and the 3/Y will keep the 2170.  Especially since they said 76% of the Model Y was the same as the Model 3.

The last part that contributes to my hunch is Musk not giving away their cost per kw to produce.  Saying it was proprietary.   I think people have already figured about how close they are currently.  So I am wondering if they have made some more big jumps and don‚Äôt want to say...like in a new battery type.

TeslaMotors,improve,4koote,My conservative speculation on how Tesla might improve Model 3 efficiency to get 215 miles of range with only a 50kWh battery.,"**TLDR**: 55kWh battery = 11% efficiency improvement from S60. 50kWh = 19% improvement. Model 3 weight reduction gives 4-6%, drag 4-7, battery 2-4, regen 2-3, software 2-6, drivetrain 0-1. Total 13-24% (multiply, don't add). As long as the smaller battery can still do 0 to 60 in 5.9, a base 50kWh battery is well within reach.

__________________________________________________________________________________________

**Intro**: Some people are skeptical that the 3 could have a battery smaller than 60kWh. Others are predicting as low as a 44kWh battery. To make a comparison, my starting point is the S60. It is the most efficient S with an EPA range of 208 miles. 60kWh/208mi = **288 Wh/mi**. (*I know there are buffers, but for the sake of comparison I'm ignoring them one-to-one*). It is also very close to the 3's stated range and acceleration with a 5.9 sec 0 to 60.

Other models are less efficient due to being heavier and/or faster. The bigger the model, the less efficient. Over time Tesla has improved efficiency on the model S, such that the new 75D nearly equals the 60 in Wh/mi. However, we know the base 3 will not have dual motors, so the older 60 makes the best comparison.

__________________________________________________________________________________________

**Improvement goals**:

* 55kWh/215 = 256Wh/mi  -> 256/288 = *11.3% efficiency improvement*

* 50kWh/215 = 233Wh/mi  ->  233/288 = *19.4% efficiency improvement*



How will Tesla create these improvements? I can think of 6 areas of focus:

**1. Weight**: With a volume 90% of the S (from Motortrend's estimate), and assuming the same density (more steel, but lighter battery chemistry), model 3 may get [*4-6% improvement.*](http://www.autoblog.com/2009/10/29/greenlings-how-does-weight-affect-a-vehicles-efficiency/)

**2. Drag**: Frontal area is 4% smaller, and Cd is aimed to be .21, a 12% improvement. We should minimally expect .23, a 4% improvement. Cd and area together give 8-16%. From [this graph](http://www.solarjourneyusa.com/Pictures/Whpermilevsspeed.jpg) drag losses at average EPA testing speed of 33mph is roughly one quarter of total losses. So we are at roughly 2-4%.

We also know from the model 3 prototypes that Tesla has done a lot of work on wheel drag as well. They previously claimed 3% increased range from the cyclone wheels, so we could expect at least 2-3% going to slipstream wheels and then something even better. So that totals *4-7% improvement*.

**3. Battery and electrical**: Better chemistry, less heat loss. For reference, in 2007 they were [""up to 80% or so"" efficient from battery to wheels](https://www.teslamotors.com/blog/magic-tesla-roadster-regenerative-braking). Pure speculation on my part, I'll say they can capture *2-4% improvement*.

**4. Regen efficiency**: Similar to battery because it's the same in reverse, just not active all the time. However, the relative amount of energy available to capture is larger than in the S because of other reductions in energy loss. I'll say *2-3% improvement*.

**5. Software efficiency**: Things like power curves and torque sleep, which had about 4% improvement (and is not reflected in the S60 range, I believe?). Who knows what other tricks they have up their sleeves. Best conservative guess, *2-6% improvement*.

**6. Mechanical drivetrain**: Eliminating friction and inertia, affects every mile but probably already well optimized. It's also possible that a drivetrain optimized for mass production could be less efficient (cost, speed of production, etc). *0-1% improvement*.



#Totals: 13.3-24.2%. 11% improvement for a 55kWh battery is an easy, safe choice. 19% improvement for a 50kWh battery is well within reach and would be an amazing leap in efficiency.

__________________________________________________________________________________________

Other notes:

-Major caveat is the ""sub 6-second 0 to 60 time."" Is a 50kWh battery big enough to pump out that power? Will newer battery chemistry help? No idea, but I'm prepared to be amazed.

-Tires will play a role, but since that is something you'll replace later anyway I didn't want to consider it.

-Lower drag reduces the highway premium, but has the drawback of reducing the city benefit. You won't be able to go 500 miles on a single charge by driving 24mph. Basically, the EPA estimate will be that much closer to ""real-world driving"" in all scenarios. Sound familiar?

-A smaller battery will hurt more during low efficiency driving, like freezing temps and snow. A larger ratio of your power use will be spent heating the cabin. Hopefully there will be countermeasures to this, like a high-efficiency heat pump.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/4koote/my_conservative_speculation_on_how_tesla_might/,MaxYoung,36111.0,0.9994

Tesla could keep the triangle frame but at a panel to ‚Äúsquare off‚Äù the rear cabin.  This could be done a couple different ways:

1 - Bring the rear window up so passengers can still see out the back when the vault is closed.  Keep the side windows the same shape so the triangle from remains exactly the same.  Additional framing could be added to square off the back roof line, creating additional head room as well.  Range would take a slight hit but Tesla could increase the battery packs by 5KW (or less) and make up for the difference in cost by selling a lot more vehicles.

2 - Create a flare above the rear of the cab that is only above the door itself and really only visible from the side angle.  I envision something that is only a few inches wide.  Gives the squared off look from the side but looking towards the back of the truck, the sloped line remains from the top of the tailgate to above the driver.

#FSD beta v12.1 is finally here. I received the OTA update while our family was vacationing at Universal Studios in LA. I couldn't wait to get home and upgrade to FSD. The release notes for 12.1 were surprisingly simple, stating that v12 has single-stack end-to-end neural nets trained with millions of video clips for the driving controls. This replaces the previous 300k lines of C++ imperative programming. Essentially, we now have to ""trust the nets"". So, how do I feel about FSD v12 after driving 500 miles? 

Here is a quick rundown:

Positive Surprises

The car drives more like a human. My wife couldn't tell whether it was me driving the vehicle or the car itself.

Highway situations:

FSD v11 (single-stack highway and locals) already handled highway driving quite well, but you could still sense the mechanistic nature of the C++ code in the control decisions. FSD v12 feels so natural. 

Here's one scenario that really surprised me: You're driving in the fast lane (left) of a two-lane highway because slower cars stay in the right lane. Then a faster car approaches from behind. FSD v12 signals, safely switches to the slower lane, lets the faster car pass, then switches back into the fast lane and stays there.

Speed control is much smoother and appears to adjust itself smoothly with the surrounding traffic flow.

FSD v12 is more patient and assertive during lane-changing maneuvers. There's no more ""middle-of-the-change hesitation"" (changing mind in the middle of a lane change).

City steets driving:

One of the ""hardest"" problems that FSD v11 and earlier versions failed to solve in my nearly three years of testing FSD beta is a surprisingly simple setup ‚Äì what I call ""neighborhood laneless road snaking"". It's very common in neighborhoods, where there are single-lane roads wide enough to accommodate roadside parking, or simply single lanes that gradually diverge into more lanes, or vice versa. All previous FSD versions struggled and tended to snake left and right within what the car perceived as a ""wide"" lane. Because of this single defect, I could never convince my wife to trust FSD driving. Well, that's finally gone in v12 with the end-to-end neural networks for driving controls ‚Äì it simply learns how a good human driver would handle such a situation ‚Äì just stays the course.

v12's handling of bumps is excellent! It reduces speed very smoothly to about 10 mph while going across bumps, making the ride super smooth.

Areas for Improvement

STOP signs: The car really doesn't have to wait a full 5 seconds (I know it's less than that, but it definitely feels that way) at every STOP sign. Every time, I have to push the accelerator to make it go a bit faster. Even if I had the patience, I'm sure the driver behind me wouldn't ‚Äì they'd be thinking, ""What the hell, you're driving a Tesla?!""

Perfect speed control is challenging because some speed signs are simply incorrect. You can't have a 40 MPH speed limit right in the middle of a highway, or try to accelerate to 70 MPH during a ramp onto the highway. It's definitely better in v12, but this still remains the main input I have to adjust from time to time.

Road conditions can sometimes be dangerous. There may be potholes, foreign objects that a good driver would constantly stay alert for and safely maneuver around with fine steering adjustments. I haven't tested FSD v12 enough in such situations, but I believe it will need continuous training to accommodate all these hazardous road situations and learn how to safely handle them.

As stated by Tesla, it is now mainly trained for good weather conditions (such as in California), and still needs a lot more training in areas with heavy precipitation, including rain and snow.

Conclusion

FSD v12 with single-stack neural networks for driving controls is definitely the (ONLY) right path forward. In fact, I think Tesla should have taken this approach much earlier rather than wasting time and effort tuning the C++ code for driving controls, which would have made it practically impossible to realize true FSD. 

Now with FSD v12, I see a step change that fundamentally solves those ""hard-to-solve"" issues ‚Äì just mimic humans! The rest is just more data and more training. That's it!",https://x.com/goproai/status/1741867410976891047?s=46,mjezzi,39409.0,0.9955
TeslaMotors,improve,ewhocy,I hope Elon and Tesla will improve their Rear Camera Guidelines,"The current TESLA rear camera guidelines is not the worst, but I don't think it provides extra aid for the driver. In my opinion, the rear camera guidelines of my 2016 Honda Civic EX (and other Honda cars) is a lot better since it provides the ACTUAL position and direction of the car when reversing as well as the distance despite the lack of sensors. On top of that, the Honda's rear camera is multi view. For those who are unfamiliar, take a look at this youtube video https://youtu.be/kLyvXuMpl34?t=76

When I reverse park in my Honda, I usually do not have to rely my side mirrors at all to check whether or not I park straight even at night. The TESLA rear camera guidelines only shows the path of the car relatively to the turning of the steering wheel. Sometimes when it looks straight in the camera, the car is completely crooked in the stall. Now whenever I reverse park in my M3, I almost always have to use my side mirrors to check if I'm straight in the stall or not and it's not the easiest to reverse park at night. I know some of you might say I am not good at reverse parking but somehow it was much easier for me with my Honda Civic.

TeslaMotors,improve,gysero,4 things my BMW 5 series did better than my M3P...,"So I've officially completed just over a month with my M3P and I'm in love. As a daily commuter, it's just brilliant. Simple, comfortable, and very satisfying to drive.

With that said, there are a few things that seem glaringly inferior when compared to my previous experience with BMW. Full disclosure: I'm a car fanatic, and pledge loyalty to no brand. I love cars for what they are and rotate through new cars every 12-16 months or so because I love to try new things. There's no hate to Tesla here, just some observations on what I think could be easily improved via software.

**1. Deactivating the car alarm is an utter FAIL.**

So using your mobile phone (iPhone 11 Pro here) as the car's key is brilliant. While it isn't perfect and can take a moment to connect via Bluetooth when approaching the car sometimes, it's mostly pretty flawless. I really enjoy the experience. It's something I love, *except* when the alarm unintentionally goes off.

One really poor example is when I went into a restaurant to grab take-out while my wife and 2 young daughters stayed in the car. I set HVAC to stay on and brought my phone in with me for mobile payments. As I was returning to my car my wife opened the passenger door to grab the food from me. But because my phone hadn't connected via Bluetooth yet, her opening the door triggered the alarm by opening the door from within.

This immediately triggered the alarm. 

If you haven't experienced the alarm, here's a quick synopsis of what its like. It's ALARMING ;)

Now imagine what it's like being inside the car still.

Heavy metal Bach music is blaring at 5000% volume, and there is NO obvious way to minimize the volume (due to lack of volume knob like a traditional car). I mean I get that it makes sense to add it because its the alarm, but seriously, it was dangerously loud for an adult, let alone a very young child inside the car.

Of course, anyone standing in front of their car is going to feel befuddled as they grope around their pockets for their key to disable the alarm only to remember that your phone is your key. Now you have to grab your phone, unlock it, open the Tesla app, and then ""unlock"" your car, all while your occupants are having their eardrums melted by the ""modern"" theft-deterrent system blasting heavy metal at 5000% volume. A ""traditional"" car could be deactivated by jamming a button on your key fob while the keys are still in your pocket. As a first-time Tesla phone-key alarm deactivator, there was simply NO warning or preparation for this kind of experience. Totally not cool. 

This seems like a glaring oversight. Not only was it an embarrassing experience for me and my family, but also any bystander who doesn't appreciate Teslas would be watching as music is blasting and thinking ""why the heck would I want my car to do that?"" Worse though, what if there was an infant in their car seat while my wife was also in the car? That could cause literal physical damage to a very young baby and there is NO apparent way to turn off any alarm quickly.

Serious fail. C'mon Elon.

* There has to be a better way to deactivate the alarm, or, proactively determine what sets off an alarm. For the latter, why can't it use the seat sensors to sense whether someone is in the car? Or the internal camera? Or use the HVAC setting to leave it ""On"" when I leave the car (or combination of both) to predict that someone may still be in the car. Or best yet, once the phone has connected via Bluetooth, deactivate the alarm. Or a push notification on my phone pops up to deactivate quickly. Finally, a deactivation method to type in a 4-digit pin on the screen would have been VERY helpful in this situation. But without any warning, the pin may not have been super obvious.

While I love the Model 3s minimalism and simplicity, there doesn't seem to be enough oversight on this functionality and how one would want disarm false alarms. It made me embarrassed to own a Tesla to say the least, and the 5 people watching us nearby were probably assuming that Tesla drivers love blasting annoying music and pissing everyone off around them.

**2. Remind the driver that they left their phone in the wireless charging tray.**

It's only been a month, but I've left my phone in the charging tray at least a dozen times now after leaving the car. Since I use the phone as my key, this is kind of a problem. My (18+) BMW M5 would notify me on the dash, and with an audible signal, that a phone is in the charging tray whenever I put it into park and opened the driver's door.

Considering that the UI notifies me when I'm closing the center console too hard (and it not sticking), I think this is a simple request.

* PLEASE, can you just set up a UI reminder that I have a phone to grab, especially because it is THE KEY? You could even make it a toggle in case people don't like it.

**3. Tesla is known for its automated (or semi-automated) driving capabilities, but my BMW was superior in two simple ways.**

When activated on the freeway, my BMW seemed far more ""simple"" in its semi-automated driving. 

First, the steering wheel resistance amount required on my M3P to not trigger a ""warning, hands on the wheel"" seems far too little on the M3P. I'll have my hands on the wheel and it won't detect them. While that is kind of annoying, it gets worse when you apply some resistance and accidentally kick it out of autopilot.

Second, the more frustrating part, is that once you ""kick it out of autopilot"", you have to manually reactivate it. My BMW would automatically turn back on once you put your hands on the wheel, and, even after changing lanes. It would stay on completely until you turned it off. 

When I change lanes in the M3P, it deactivates autopilot and then you have to turn it back on. It gets old after about 3 times of doing this and then you just don't want to use the feature anymore because of how annoying it is.

* Allow Autopilot to turn back on after a lane change. I don't want to have to think about Autopilot again when I feel the need to take over the car temporarily. 

Thirdly, the reactivity of the active cruise control to decelerate when approaching a car in front seems far more excessive than the BMW did. It will decelerate in a much more extreme way and is quite jarring in some instances. This would require a more refined sensitivity level, but, just my opinion on this last one.

**4. Allow users to adjust the lower UI controls.**

I think the UI in the M3 is far superior than the MS I drove in 2018. The always-on controls on the bottom of the screen are helpful, but I would LOVE the ability to customize them.

Two things I will likely never use in AZ: the front or rear defroster, and the seat heaters. That takes up valuable UI space for something I would rather have: 1) rear HVAC on/off, 2) Fan speed (non auto mode), 3) other.

For #1, since I live in AZ, the AC will be used basically ever day for 9 months. I would love a quick toggle to turn the rear AC on and off. Sometimes I have the kiddos with me, sometimes I don't. Right now I leave it always on so I don't have to mess with it, but obviously that uses more energy than needed. This would be quite welcome.

For #2, when in auto mode, the fan speeds adjust based on the thermostat setting. But if you don't want it in auto, then you have to enter the additional HVAC menu and make adjustments there. I'd love to manually control fan speed from the lower permanent UI than having to go into a menu.

For #3, I love seeing the energy consumption graph. Not a deal breaker that it takes 2 taps to get there, but I'll never use the heated seats or front/rear defroster icons. I don't need those taking up 20% of icon space, especially when I accidentally turn on the heated seat when reaching for the HVAC temp control.

* Suggestion: allow users to edit the lower UI icons. Take a play from Apple (or any other smartphone) and allow your main buttons to be customizable. The Macbook's Touch Bar is completely customizable and has a very intuitive interface to do so.

TeslaMotors,improve,hl80c1,Taking a stand on improving Tesla customer support," 

**Disclaimer:**

I may take a hit by posting this but I think it could be good food for thought.  **This is not some sort of anti-Tesla rhetoric but a way we as Tesla owners can support each other when there is a clear wrong.**   To be upfront, I have -not- had any issues with Tesla or customer  service in terms of bad experiences (at least not yet).  I mean, I've  been vocal about FSD and how I think they have been going about it the  wrong way in terms of market penetration but that is another topic.

**The Perceived Issue**

Increasingly  over the last several months I've seen a lot of complaints against the  way Tesla handles something or short changes customers.  I am ever aware  that negative feedback tends to stand out more but here on reddit, for  example, there is a very pro-Tesla crowd so I think it is relatively  balanced out.

That being said,  Tesla, while they have grown leaps and bounds since the original  Roadster, is still very much in its formative years and they tend to  make some questionable decisions when it comes to supporting their  customers (sometimes this is location dependent but also tends to affect  the whole when it comes to policy).  So, I have been thinking, aside  from posting in the Tesla forums, posting here in this subreddit and/or  trying to ping Elon on twitter and hope he acknowledges and fixes an  issue, what other avenue do we have?

**Proposal**

My  thought is if Tesla refuses to acknowledge a clear issue and/or tries  to short-change customers, we could protest by hitting them in the  technological money-maker: opting out of any opt-in data that helps them  improve their AI, software and other improvements that rely on this  data.

**Some Issues or Challenges with this approach**

\-  Of course, one person isn't going to make a difference.  But if we  created a customer 'collective', a sizable 'data protest' might be very  noticeable to Tesla

\- Who decides  what issue warrants a data protest by the collective?  This is a very  reasonable question and I'm not quite sure if I have an answer for it  yet.  Community voting, perhaps?

\-  Requires individual commitment, as each user would have to disable the  opt-in data collection whenever a collective protest is formally  launched

\- This can have a  reduction software improvements for our vehicles.   But I think the  short term effects would be offset by the long term gains

\-  Would this cause Tesla to change the opt-in data system to 'required'  as part of their software update policy or are various regional laws  enough to prevent this from happening?

**How now, brown cow?**

What  I am hoping to see from this is healthy discussions as to the pros and  cons of such an idea and perhaps any other avenues in which Tesla  customers can get the support they deserve when Tesla is at fault.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hl80c1/taking_a_stand_on_improving_tesla_customer_support/,likebutta222,68866.0,0.9654

TeslaMotors,improve,4g7gsf,"If anyone from Tesla reads this...please improve your german website, because it's utter shit","Hello,

As a friend of Tesla I'm disappointed about the quality of the german version of the Tesla website. From a multi-billion dollar company I expect a high-quality website, not some utter garbage I wouldn't let my third cousins ex-girlfriend publish (okay, it's not so bad, but still). I actually e-mailed Tesla about that a few months ago but nobody answered and nothing changed.

Also, know that Tesla enters the semi-mass-market, a good website is becoming even more important since from now on not only the ""nerds and tech-enthusiasts"" will visit but also your buddys mom.

A few points:

* **Mixed and bad language:** Some parts are in good german, some are in bad german, some are in english. Yes, most young people can speak english, but mixing languages? That just looks stupid and low quality, as if Tesla can't afford someone to translate. Also, not everyone is fluent in english.

* **Mixed currency:** I can reserve my Tesla for a 1.000 ‚Ç¨ but the price is named as 35.000 $ ? That just looks silly. How hard can it be for a round table of elite marketing people to settle on a euro-price? Or just program an auto-converter until then (Yes I know a thousand reasons why it would be hard to settle for a price, but I don't care because generic customer #1314121 doesn't care) Also, most people don't know the $-‚Ç¨-conversion rate from memory and about as many care to google the euro-equavilent of 35.000 $ (it's 31.184,56 ‚Ç¨).

* **No price tag for the Model X:** I searched for 5 minutes but couldn't find it. Only that my down payment is 4.000 ‚Ç¨. 

* **No range/configuration tool for model X:** For the Model S there is actually a range/configuration tool and I'm told the price - but none of the above for the Model X.

* **No driven mileage/cost-saving tool:** If I'm gonna buy a Tesla, my first thought is *How much do I save on fuel?*. That of course depends on how much I drive, yes? Maybe it's the difference in cultural mindsets, but providing me with a blanket cost-saving of 7.000 ‚Ç¨ for the Model S doesn't make sense - Tesla doesn't know how much I drive or how much fuel my current car needs. No, I'm pretty sure most germans feel like me about this. What is needed is a tool where I enter how much I drove or how much fuel I used and converts that to cost saving.

* **No infos on government subsidies:** It seems I was wrong above, something did change since I mailed Tesla: The infos on government subsidies are gone completely now (or I can't find them after 5 minutes). Whos bullshit idea was that? How hard can it be to compile a list of government subsidies for the different germans states (just 16) and keep it up to date. That's a *major* factor in the buying decision. (Yes I understand that Tesla wants the decision to be emotionally motivated bla bla marketing, but I dont care)

\---------------------

To Whom it May Concern:

You sent me a survey to better understand my post-purchase vehicle satisfaction. I'm sure you'll be pleased to see that I am clearly still absolutely enthralled with my Model S even after almost 2 years of ownership.  To provide a balanced perspective, I felt it was important to also provide feedback on how I perceived your brand, peripheral support tools and services, as well as your various field service organizations.

To be clear, I am at least for now leaning towards NOT purchasing another Tesla as my next vehicle. My concerns are detailed below, and I'm sharing them because I believe Tesla still has an opportunity to change my leaning from ""likely not"" to ""likely yes,"" if steps are taken within the reasonable near term (e.g. 6-12 months).

What I‚Äôm looking for is a visible and authentic acknowledgment of the concerns (not just mine, but what you actually hear from your customers across the board, and what ""top 3"" issues or concerns emerge), along with a plan for addressing them. The best business is repeat business, and as things stand now from my vantage point, my and many others' repeat business is at serious risk.

Ok, so let's talk turkey.

Speaking only for myself, I have to be blunt. The Service Center experience (or, really, any experience that involves trying to speak with a real person during the buying or post-purchase process) is pretty terrible. It's a 1/10 in the ""something I have to do that isn't work or chores"" list, coming in just behind cleaning my pool filter. And it's not just one thing - it's a whole bunch of not-good experiences strung together over time.

First, it has to do with Tesla providing only one entry point to their service reservation system - the Tesla app. This should be a case study for bad UX and a single point of failure; but it's also impersonal, inefficient and in some cases even confusing for the customer. Because the app limits any real opportunity for problem solving or conversational dialogue with some who-knows-where disembodied service advisor, it results in multiple back-and-forth exchanges over time. I find myself describing the problem (if it‚Äôs not a simple issue, which I imagine represents at least a significant minority of your total service requests) or answering a (singular) question and waiting a day or two to hear back. Then, after having lost context when the response comes in at some point in the future, I tend to find the ""answer"" is another follow-up question or request for clarification. In many ways during this process, I'm reminded of how I feel I'm making an appointment with the DMV, and that's never a positive brand association. I do, however, rank the DMV appointment-making experience as marginally better than Tesla‚Äôs because with the DMV's system you can use a computer OR your mobile device.

Separate from the reservation process, let‚Äôs talk about the customer experience after arriving to the SC. My personal belief is that the odds of securing a loaner vehicle once on-site are about the same as the odds of hitting a royal flush in 5-card poker - a bad bet, to be sure. As a result, this leaves the customer with no choice but to make use of a provided Uber credit. I appreciate the fact that the credit is a fairly generous number and supports more than a few trips, and I also appreciate that Tesla HAS an option other than having to find a friend, spouse, or public transport. BUT - there is a non-trivial amount of hassle and inefficiency that other LUXURY brand dealership service centers eliminate.

And that means that if I take my vehicle to Audi, to BMW, or to Mercedes for service, I don't have to plan for how I will manage transportation DURING the period of service. Using Uber is better than nothing, but it is an added time and mental cost that other premium service experiences don't charge.

I get that Tesla is theoretically attempting to automate as much as possible and thereby keep labor costs to a minimum, but I would counsel Tesla leadership and brand stewards to consider the long-term impact; til recently and probably even currently, the cost of customer acquisition to Tesla has been low due to grassroots marketing, word-of-mouth, and the (now cancelled) Tesla referral program. Clearly, this marketing strategy can never be a long-term, guaranteed model. Customer churn is something to fear - and it happens in large part because the affected company chose to disregard the intrinsic value of being able to speak with someone on the phone or at least on a real-time (not asynchronous) live-chat system. This gives the customer confidence that IN THE MOMENT a company representative understands their issue and will work with them on a solution. The app-based service center approach is trading off efficiency and/or near-term cost savings for long-term customer disengagement and dissatisfaction.

Moving on, let‚Äôs stay within the broader category of customer frustration and brand reputational damage, but find a way of reducing both of those by investing in more thorough inspection of and correction for fit and finish issues. By this, I specifically mean inspection and correction when the vehicle comes off the assembly line versus half-hearted or ineffective attempts to do so when the vehicle is already in the delivery center and due to the customer in the next hours or day. I recognize that improving quality is more than just encouraging employees to pay better attention to detail - it requires a commitment to quality assurance as a manufacturing protocol that requires a non-trivial investment in training, people and infrastructure. However, I can't think of any other brand's $100K+ vehicle that have multiple documented instances where a trip to the service center was required immediately after purchase to address things like paint defects or removal of a random screw that was rolling around in the door panel.

And this isn‚Äôt the customer‚Äôs fault because they ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt find the issue during delivery.‚Äù As it turns out, issues with the vehicle tend to go unnoticed during the delivery process itself - due to the excitement of getting a new car and due to at least the first-time buyer‚Äôs lack of familiarity with the vehicle and delivery process itself. These issues could in fact have a material impact on vehicle quality and safety. And then what? What is a customer to do if they find these issues on their driveway versus at the DC? As far as I can find, there's no formal process for requesting remediation from Tesla, forcing the customer to search on forums or call other owners in an extremely frustrating and unexpected cram session on the dark art of navigating Tesla‚Äôs labyrinthine corporate support and service infrastructure.

I can empathize with how frustrating finding yourself in this situation can be - because I experienced it myself. Although the issues were ultimately resolved, it required over 20 phone calls (no exaggeration, I have the call logs to prove it) to find the right ""actual"" person to speak with and 2 separate visits to the service center to finally get the issues remediated. This included a rear quarter panel and bumper full repaint, replacement of a scratched carbon fiber spoiler, the B-Pillar cover and baseplate realigned so the metal wasn't showing, and the drivers-side LED trunk light permanently affixed in such a way that it no longer fell to the trunk floor every time I drove more than 2 miles.

The first-month ""honeymoon"" period of any person‚Äôs vehicle ownership tends to leave an indelible mark on a customer‚Äôs psyche - particularly if it was negative. In my case, it left me unable to make use of or consistently enjoy my vehicle for a full 8 calendar days during that month, and the resulting dissatisfaction I felt then is still as fresh in my mind as it was 2 years ago. In terms of leaving a bad taste in a customer's mouth, I equate it to a four-course meal of pickled herring paired with garlic-infused hummus, followed by a main dish of liver and onions and finished with a playfully spicy roquefort cheesecake and a carafe of day-old black coffee; unfiltered cigarettes as between-course ""palate-cleansing"" refreshment

In case it wasn't already clear, let me be blunt: I am currently unsupportive of Tesla as a brand and what it provides customers in the field. My own anecdotal personal observations, coupled with recent articles in mass media and posts on social media sites, lead me to believe that Tesla's brand has already been negatively impacted by Mr. Musk‚Äôs recent online and offline shenanigans. In particular, the Twitter debacle gives at least the appearance of disingenuous statements being made and bad-faith business practices being supported. This airing of dirty laundry is unfortunately (for Tesla) coinciding with ACTUAL availability of well-styled, performant, and equivalently (at the Model S and X tier) priced vehicle options from traditional auto manufacturers.

It's an unfortunate series of events for Tesla, but it presents potential EV (new and existing) with an unprecedented array of non-Tesla options. I suspect that the reason I‚Äôm receiving this survey 2 years after I purchased my vehicle may be driven in some part by a concern within Tesla corporate that maybe things aren‚Äôt all rainbows and unicorns in terms of overall customer satisfaction, and my goal with this ridiculously long diatribe is simply to tell you these four words: your concern is real. I suggest you work quickly to make some changes.

TL;DR - Focus Tesla‚Äôs ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù brand marketing to be more about the company itself than Mr. Musk, fix your pre-delivery quality issues, fix your lack of Service Center personalization, and find non-Uber options to (significantly) bolster your availability of in-service loaner vehicles. IMHO, even making it a goal or initiating a project/program that can be reported on as funded and to commence at a future date in your next 10K would be a very promising step forward.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/wgi5ko/sharing_with_yall_my_feedback_to_tesla_in/,ansyhrrian,487613.0,0.9678

TeslaMotors,missing,1l7rm0h,Tesla versus Waymo: Two Very Different Roads to Full Autonomy.,"üöó Tesla vs. Waymo: Two Very Different Roads to Full Autonomy üõ£Ô∏è

Take a look at the illustration below (credit: Chris Philpot, BloombergNEF). It reveals just how differently two leaders in self-driving technology ‚Äúsee‚Äù the world:

Tesla vs Waymo
Cameras - 8 vs 14
Radar - 0 vs 6
Lidar - 0 vs 4
Total sensors - 8 vs 24

Key Take-aways

1. Minimalism vs. Redundancy
Tesla bets on an 8-camera, vision-only stack. Waymo layers cameras + radar + LiDAR (24 sensors) for high-confidence perception.


2. Cost & Scalability
Fewer sensors mean lower BOM and easier mass production for Tesla‚Äîbut also heavier reliance on advanced AI to make up for missing depth data.


3. Edge-Case Handling
Multi-modal sensing (Waymo) can offer robustness in low-light, glare, and inclement weather. Vision-only (Tesla) must solve these purely in software.


4. Compute Requirements
More sensors = richer data = greater processing demands. Waymo‚Äôs stack leans on hefty onboard compute; Tesla optimizes around its custom FSD chips and over-the-air neural-network updates.

Which philosophy will win out as we close in on Level 4/5 autonomy‚Äî AI-centric minimalism or sensor-fusion redundancy? And how should startups or tier-1 suppliers and OEMs position themselves in this debate?

TeslaMotors,missing,npvs38,"Why""you cant drive off radar alone"" misses the point","I've responded to so many in this idea that I'm just going to post it on it's own.

Basically the idea keep coming across is that radar is a useless backup system because you can't drive on radar alone so if vision fails you have to stop anyway.

The reality is that while you can't drive on radar alone, you can drive on radar and last known road data for a short while... Say long enough for a splash of rain to stop blinding the camera.

You do this by utilizing multiple sensors and:

1: Using the last frame of lane data from vision before it got blinded the road shape will not change, you know there won't suddenly be a 90 degree left turn where they wasn't one a second ago.

2: Use radar to ensure the thing that CAN change (other cars location) didn't result in an obstacle ahead of you.  While the road can't change a car could cut you off.  As long as you know this didn't happen you can keep driving off the lane data you stored from vision.

3: Use IMU to ensure you're following your stored data.  By monitoring acceleration in different directions you can have pretty good confidence of where you are relative to the road for a few seconds.  

So while you can't drive on radar alone for long periods you can very much combine it's data with other sensors to cover short term failures in one.  Which is basically what Elon was referring to https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/noxprt/in_light_of_recent_events_with_radar_and_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/npvs38/whyyou_cant_drive_off_radar_alone_misses_the_point/,devedander,351390.0,-0.2466

TeslaMotors,missing,df13ul,To Raven or Not to Raven?,"Alright I'm trusting you Redditors with this one!

As you may or may not know, I became a first time Tesla owner in 2016, almost exactly 3 years ago today. The test drive instantly hooked me. [Apollo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ICgMYIzhxg) was a 3 year lease.

Before I took the dive, I'd been waiting patiently. With any piece of tech, there are good and bad times to buy. So when Tesla unveiled the P100D update and new front fascia, I knew it was perfect. A brand new car with the latest and greatest of what Tesla had to offer. Perfect time to buy. Or at least I thought.

2 weeks later, Tesla pulled ANOTHER major update to autopilot 2.0 hardware with extra cameras, etc. Older cars could not be retrofitted. So instantly Apollo feels slightly outdated. I still love her, but I felt slightly jipped. And I definitely want to avoid that feeling again.

So here we are in 2019 at the end of the line with Apollo. She's aging and doesn't get all the V10 features. I actually have a 6 month bonus month-to-month lease extension until March 2020 to make my choice and give Apollo back. I know I want to keep driving Model S... Do I just upgrade to the Raven Model S now and assume Plaid Model S is the next refresh? Or are the chances high of a refresh coming in the next few months that will make new Raven owners feel ripped off again? Interior refresh? Battery update?

Now we can charge our 3 at 48 amps and I see that Tesla doesn't even sell wall chargers capable of >48 amps. Does anyone miss the ability to charge faster at home? I don't. I didn't regret spending the extra for 80 amp charging for my S.,https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/oavvb1/does_anyone_miss_80_amp_home_charging/,olddoc1,34740.0,0.9139
TeslaMotors,missing,jor4pj,Tesla frustrations (Range/FSD/Cost/Leasing/Trust/Fear of Missing Out),"Sorry for the wall of text.

A brief background: I consider myself to be an ""average"" consumer, with an interest in tech/electric cars.

I started dabbling into electric cars with a Chevy Volt back in 2016.  This was a way for me to get ""50 miles of range"" with a gas backup.  This was great commuter car, though I questioned the quality of the gasoline backup engine. After leasing for 3 years, I had something like 70% of my driving was all electric.

I waffled back and forth about going ""all electric"" and finally pulled the trigger on a leased Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus.  I didn't know if I was going to be happy being 100% electric, as I no longer had the gasoline backup, which is why I wanted to lease.  They just came out with the $399 deal too, but I settled for a lesser upfront down-payment and sitting around $475/mo.

Overall, it's been a good experience, but there are some frustrations I have with the car/tesla in general.  I am on the fence about whether my next car will be a Tesla or not. More about this later.

Frustration #1: Average Car efficiency vs stated range:

The 2019 Standard range plus is rated for 240 miles.  A HUGE justification for me going all electric with Tesla is the supercharger network.  I also opted for the standard range variant because 240 miles in any given direction there was a supercharger.  From the Tesla Supercharger in Little Rock to the Supercharger in Memphis is 163 miles. 240 should be plenty.  The temperature for this particular drive was 50F average.  I went from 98% SOC to 14% SOC.

[https://imgur.com/a/JOAWvSk](https://imgur.com/a/JOAWvSk)  (min distance per drive 1mile)

There's nothing new here that people don't already know, but given any drive, you're only looking on average about 75-80% efficiency.  Winter city driving can be as low as 60% (and it doesn't get below freezing here.)  The reason this is important, is that you're supposed to keep the car between 90% and 10%.  The 240 range, is now 192 (10% off the top and bottom).  Add to that a wintertime efficiency of 60%, that's 115mi of range before needing a recharge. My daily commute is 20mi (10mi each way) x 5 days a week.  When I first got the car, I was charging 100% off the public infrastructure, and to be honest it was a hassle.  I had to charge on Sunday for my work week (40 mins), and Charge on Friday (40 mins) for the weekend.  The 240V chargepoint chargers work ""ok"" at a rate of about 10% SoC per hour.  If someone else plugs into the same charger while charging it's about 5% per hour.  All that being said, it was such a hassle that I ended up renting out a garage for $100/mo just so I can do daily charging. \[I live in an apartment.\]

Frustration #2:  ""Planned Superchargers""

Even though that Memphis trip was a bit of a stretch, when I bought the car it said there was a planned opening half way between Little Rock and Memphis in Forrest City.  ""Target opening 2019"" at the time.  Same with the one opening in Arkadelphia.  ""Oh well this range anxiety thing will be a non-issue once those open up later this year.""  Except they never opened.  They changed the target date to ""opening in 2020.""  I fully suspect come 2021 that will be the new target.  I know they will eventually come, but a huge let down of me expecting them to come at the advertised time.  I recently drove from Dallas to Little Rock and started out with a 95% charge, and then it got COLD outside (like 50-55F).  My defroster/heater came on and we were going to run out of battery before we got to Little Rock.  I told my wife that we have to drive without heat to make it back, and use the defroster sparingly.  We made it back with 9%. Since winter weather is just starting here, I will likely have to take my wife's ICE car next time we go.

Frustration #3:  Autopilot (included)

Before I purchased my M3, I saw videos of people \[wrecklessly\] putting on makeup while driving, and things like this:

[https://www.thedrive.com/news/36366/morons-leave-driver-seat-empty-let-tesla-autopilot-drive-so-they-can-keep-drinking-in-the-car](https://www.thedrive.com/news/36366/morons-leave-driver-seat-empty-let-tesla-autopilot-drive-so-they-can-keep-drinking-in-the-car)

I knew going in that this was not normal and extremely dangerous.  I knew going in that it was a ""driver assist"" L2 system and required 100% attention at all times.  I tapered my expectations WAY back, and decided I would be happy if it helped with interstate driving \[it does.\] Even after I purchased, people would ask me if ""is that the car that drives itself?"" I assumed it was at least a very capable system, if people are /that/ wreckless with it, then when used properly it should be a fantastic driver assist feature.

Except it's not (wasn't?).  When I first got the car, I would have horrific problems with phantom breaking on the interstate (usually involving overpasses and shadows.)  While I still used it on my daily commute, I eventually learned that I had to ""baby sit"" autopilot, just in case it decides to randomly brake.  It didn't make my commute less stressful, just now when someone pulls up close to my rear, I have to make sure to rest my foot on the accelerator in case it wants to brake.

After owning it for a bit and using Autopilot, I had to tell people that it most certainly doesn't even come close to being able to drive itself.  I even tell people that it can actually be dangerous, due to the phantom braking issues I've encountered.

To be fair, with the continual updates, it's gotten a lot better, but I still have to baby sit it when people drive too close.  I think it's a good system, and on long road trips it's a godsend for fatigue.   I do not trust it (nor should anyone for any L2-L4 assist system).  Word of note, even though I like it, it does not pass the wife test.  She yells at me for using it because it makes her feel unsafe.  I do not use it when we are riding together.

Frustration #4:  Full-Self-Driving package (add on:) / Can't buy-out Lease.

I'm leasing my car, so any add on packages are lost when the car is returned to Tesla.  Tesla also stated that there is no buying out the car at end of lease. The reason for this was because they were going to be rolling out the Robo-taxi service.  So I can't buy the FSD package, and then buy the car out later either.  I know supposedly they are going to come out with a subscription plan for lessees, and that's a decent stop gap.

The problem: After driving the Model 3 for a little over a year now, the price of the FSD package keeps going up.  It's something I want to buy, but didn't because I'm leasing.  I'm leasing because I didn't know if going all electric was for me.  I've got 2 years left on my lease, and I've been seriously thinking about purchasing Tesla as my next car.  Which kind of brings me to the very last frustration is that if FSD keeps going up over the next two years -- that owning a Tesla suddenly becomes ""not worth the price / hassle"".  Delaying the purchase of FSD just makes it more expensive so it's a zero-win game when trying to balance a budget.

All being said for me to get the product that I actually want, would be looking at the Model Y, Long range w/ FSD.  That's a $60,000 dollar car.  And FSD will go up in price before my lease is up.  The standard ranges aren't enough in my experience (outlined above), and I'm getting shafted on the FSD price going up because I leased due to uncertainty w/ all electric.

At the end of the day, I think the rising cost of the FSD package will end up being what drives me away from Tesla.  All the other hassles I'd be okay with living with, and even stretching my budget so I can get the Long range model, adding the cost of a rising FSD package is the straw that's making me consider to just go back to driving an ICE car.

There's an old saying ""The juice isn't worth the squeeze"" - well I think it was worth it.  The standard range plus is a good car.  But by the time my lease is over and I'm ready to buy, I'm guessing the price of the ""car I want"" will be too much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/jor4pj/tesla_frustrations_rangefsdcostleasingtrustfear/,netnem,1169.0,0.955

TeslaMotors,missing,7hjhv1,Tesla doomsayers missing one big thing,"It seems that everyday you have sites like Seeking Alpha or people like Bub Lutz painting Tesla‚Äôs impending doom and one of their biggest factors is how all the other car makers are great at making cars and will totally blow them away when they finally decide to just start making e cars in mass. 

Here‚Äôs the thing, they‚Äôre good at making ICE cars, not electric cars. There‚Äôs a huge difference and a reason they sell all their current e cars at a loss, batteries. That‚Äôs something they‚Äôre not good at, in fact, I think it‚Äôs pretty clear they‚Äôre not all that good at all at making batteries. That‚Äôs why the lose money on their e cars and why they are a long way off from beating Tesla in the mass production of e cars. Most manufacturers don‚Äôt even have the capability of producing batteries in large quantities, Tesla on the other hand produces about half the car batteries in the world with the facility that can continue to ramp up and increase their production level. Other manufacturers have to hope to buy a share of the remaining batteries on the market, which could artificially increase their price due to a high demand, another benefit of Tesla having the Gigafactory. 

So in the end, if Tesla makes half of the batteries in the world, how will all the other car manufacturers be able to ‚Äúblow them away‚Äù? It just seems like a hopeful argument to help out their Tesla short sells. Do I think Tesla stock will continue to skyrocket up, no, their will be bumps along the way as they expand and ramp up production. They also have a lot of spending coming up to build out the Megacharger Network, so maybe more need for capital. But fail? Not a chance. And if the Tesla Network launches in the next few years with autonomous driving, well then theirs no limit to how high the stock will go.

TeslaMotors,missing,cqkrvw,It's a combination of small features that add up to things you'll miss...,"Was recently rear-ended in a low speed traffic collision on the tollway. Its a steep 3 mile  downhill area in the mountains that is bumper-to-bumper traffic for most part of the afternoon and evening. Most people ride their breaks down the entire stretch because of the incline, so speeds are typically below 10.

I was stopped behind the car in front of me for a good 2 seconds. before I feel a great push, and heard a loud crumbling sound. Some lady on her phone plowed into my rear with her SUV, crumbling my trunk, splitting my bumper, an dislodging my taillight; Captured it on TeslaCam. My car looked like that thing from the Goonies. 

Fast forward and I'm in my first day in my rental. It's a Ford Hybrid that tops out at 80mph full throttle, 90 with a little help from a hill, and 75 going uphill. The 0-30 takeoff is nice, but once 35 hits and the gas engine erupts on, that's when the crawling and ginourmous shaking begins. It feels like a Prius prototype from 2001; the engine shakes the car in a way that make the ride feel like a school bus. And the car is fairly new, around a 2018 model year.

The Start Button: first hopping in, I momentarily forgot how to start a regular vehicle. It took me a good 10 seconds of fondling to figure out what to do. 

Shifting: I immediately pull the right steering stock and are greeted with a nice surprise of windshield wiper action. I eventually find the rotary dial shifter, which I must admit is pretty nice as well- though I prefer the huge center console storage of my Model S.

Braking: Having come accostomed to the heavy regenerative braking of electric vehicle, getting used to braking distances on this vehicle was an adjustment. Though, I'll admit my previous BMW did have a great regenerative braking system as well, though not with a much stopping power as the Tesla.

The UI: The interface on this Fusion Hybrid is the worst thing I have had the pleasure of using in 2019. It's responsive and touchscreen, I'll give it that, but the button placement, menu categories, screen size, and overall graphics are attrocious. Even worse are the 2 small horrizontal screens sorrounding the speedometer. When you have one screen set to display the speed, large text prompting you to hit ""OK"" to switch to km never goes away. It's distracing as the text is nearly as large as the speed and it's the same color, making the digital speedometer almost useless. 

Turning off the Car: At least 3 times I've exited the vehicle with it still running, only for it to bark two loud honks at me as I exited. I had gotten too accustomed to the lack of an on/off on the Tesla that it became second-nature to just leave the car when I was done driving. 

The backup camera: The backup camera is around 480p on this Fusion, and very narrow. With the Model S wide angle camera, you can essentially see to the sides of the vehicle. 

Most importantly-Autopilot and related features: This 1.5hr commute felt the longest it had ever taken in my life. The drive was much more energy consuming due to the extra demand on focus. The lack of brake hold meant my foot was dead by the time we reached the hill bottom, the inconsistent  and weak brakes meant I had to brake for much longer and much less smoothly, and the lack of autopilot meant I could never take a break. I had literally felt like I had driven twice the distance as usual energy wise, compared to making the same regular commute in my Model S just 1 day prior. 

The real kicker - I've only had my Tesla for 2 months, and I had already gotten so used to the car's features that it becamr a thoughtless process. Based on what I've been reading online about Tesla's repair process, I may be without my car longer than I've had it üò¢.

All in all, Model S gets a 10/10 in my eyes. Never felt this heartbroken about not getting to drive a vehicle lol.           -Peace.Love.Happiness",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/cqkrvw/its_a_combination_of_small_features_that_add_up/,ImThatDude,675.0,0.9705

TeslaMotors,missing,acjdrt,Tesla Autopilot HW3 details,"For the past few months Tesla has been slowly sharing details of its upcoming ‚ÄúHardware 3‚Äù (HW3) changes soon to be introduced into its S/X/3 lineup.  Tesla has stated that cars will begin to be built with the new computer sometime in the first half of 2019, and they have said that this is a simple computer upgrade, with all vehicle sensors (radar, ultrasonics, cameras) staying the same.

Today we have some information about what HW3 actually will (and won‚Äôt) be:

What do we know about the Tesla‚Äôs upcoming HW3?  We actually know quite a bit now thanks to Tesla‚Äôs latest firmware. The codename of the new HW3 computer is ‚ÄúTURBO‚Äù.

Hardware:

We believe the new hardware is based on Samsung Exynos 7xxx SoC, based on the existence of ARM A72 cores (this would not be a super new SoC, as the Exynos SoC is about an Oct 2015 vintage).  HW3 CPU cores are clocked at 1.6GHz, with a MALI GPU at 250MHz and memory speed 533MHz.

HW3 architecture is similar to HW2.5 in that there are two separate compute nodes (called ‚Äúsides‚Äù): the ‚ÄúA‚Äù side that does all the work and the ‚ÄúB‚Äù side that currently does not do anything.

Also, it appears there are some devices attached to this SoC. Obviously, there is some emmc storage, but more importantly there‚Äôs a Tesla PCI-Ex device named ‚ÄúTRIP‚Äù that works as the NN accelerator. The name might be an acronym for ‚ÄúTensor <something> Inference Processor‚Äù.  In fact, there are at least two such ‚ÄúTRIP‚Äù devices, and maybe possibly two per ‚Äúside‚Äù.

As of mid-December, this early firmware‚Äôs state of things were in relative early bring-up. No actual autopilot functionality appears included yet, with most of the code just copied over from existing HW2.5 infrastructure.  So far all the cameras seem to be the same.

It is running Linux kernel 4.14 outside of the usual BuildRoot 2 environment.

In reviewing the firmware, we find descriptions of quite a few HW3 board revisions already (8 of them actually) and hardware for model 3 and S/X are separate versions too (understandably).

The ‚ÄúTRIP‚Äù device obviously is the most interesting one. A special firmware that encompasses binary NN (neural net) data is loaded there and then eventually queried by the car vision code. The device runs at 400MHz. Both ‚ÄúTRIP‚Äù devices currently load the same NNs, but possibly only a subset is executed on each?

With the Exynos SoC being a 2015 vintage and in consideration of comments made by Peter Bannon on the Q2 2018 earnings call, (he said ‚Äúthree years ago when I joined Tesla we did a survey of all of the solutions‚Äù = 2nd half of 2015), does this look like the current HW2/HW2.5 NVIDIA autopilot units were always viewed as a stop-gap and hence the lack of perceived computation power everybody was accusing Tesla of at the time of AP2 release was not viewed as important by Tesla?

SOFTWARE:

In reviewing the binaries in this new firmware, u/DamianXVI was able to work out a pretty good idea of what the ‚ÄúTRIP‚Äù coprocessor does on HW3 (he has an outstanding ability to look at and interpret binary data!):

The ‚ÄúTRIP‚Äù software seems to be a straight list of instructions aligned to 32 bytes (256 bits).  Programs operate on two types of memory, one for input/output and one for working memory.  The former is likely system DRAM and the latter internal SRAM.
Memory operations include data loading, weight loading, and writing output.  Program operations are pipelined with data loads and computations interleaved and weight fetching happening well upstream from the instructions that actually use those weights.  Weights seem to be compressed from the observation that they get copied to an internal region that is substantially larger than the source region with decompression/unpacking happening as part of the weight loading operation.  Intermediate results are kept in working memory with only final results being output to shared memory. 

Weights are loaded from shared memory into working memory and maintained in a reserved slot which is referenced by number in processing instructions.  Individual processing instructions reference input, output, and weights in working memory.  Some processing instructions do not reference weights and these seem to be pooling operations.

u/DamianXVI created graphical visualizations of this data flow for some of the networks observed in the binaries. This is not a visualization of the network architecture, it is a visualization of instructions and their data dependencies.  In these visualizations, green boxes are data load/store. White boxes is weights load. Blue are computation instructions with weights, red and orange are computation blocks without weights.  Black links show output / input overlapping between associated processing operations. Blue links connect associated weight data. These visualizations are representative of a rough and cursory understanding of the data flow.  Obviously, it is likely many links are missing and some might be wrong.  Regardless, you can see the complexity being introduced with these networks.

What is very interesting is that u/DamianXVI concluded that these visualizations look like GoogleNet. At the outset, he did not work with the intention to see if Tesla‚Äôs architecture was similar to GoogleNet; he hadn‚Äôt even seen GoogleNet before, but as he assembled the visualization the similarities appeared.

Diagrams: https://imgur.com/a/nAAhnyW

After understanding the new hardware and NN architecture a bit, we then asked u/jimmy_d to comment and here‚Äôs what he has to say:

‚ÄúDamian‚Äôs analysis describes exactly what you‚Äôd want in an NN processor.  A small number of operations that distill the essence of processing a neural network: load input from shared memory/ load weights from shared memory / process a layer and save results to on-chip memory / process the next layer ‚Ä¶ / write the output to shared memory.  It does the maximum amount of work in hardware but leaves enough flexibility to efficiently execute any kind of neural network.

And thanks Damian‚Äôs heroic file format analysis I was able to take a look at some neural network dataflow diagrams and make some estimates of what the associate HW3 networks are doing.  Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt find anything to get excited about.  The networks I looked at are probably a HW3 compatible port of the networks that are currently running on HW2.

What I see is a set of networks that are somewhat refined compared to earlier versions, but basically the same inputs and outputs and small enough that they can run on the GPU in HW2.  So still no further sightings of ‚ÄúAKNET_V9‚Äù: the unified, multi frame, camera agnostic architecture that I got a glimpse of last year.  Karpathy mentioned on the previous earnings call that Tesla already had bigger networks with better performance that require HW3 to run.  What I‚Äôve seen so far in this new HW3 firmware is not those networks.

What we know about the HW3 NN processor right now is pretty limited.  Apparently there are two ‚ÄúTRIP‚Äù units which seem to be organized as big matrix multipliers with integrated accumulators, nonlinear operators, and substantial integrated memory for storing layer activations.  Additionally it looks like weight decompression is implemented in hardware.  This is what I get from looking at the primitives in the dataflow and considering what it would take to implement them in hardware.  Two big unknowns at the moment are the matrix multiplier size and the onboard memory size.  That, plus the DRAM I/O bus width, would let us estimate the performance envelope.  We can do a rough estimate as follows:

Damian‚Äôs analysis shows a preference for 256 byte block sizes in the load/store instructions.  If the matrix multiplier input bus is that width then it suggests that the multiplier is 256xN in size.  There are certain architectural advantages to being approximately square, so let‚Äôs assume 256x256 for the multiplier size and that it operates at one operation per clock at @verygreen‚Äôs identified clock rate of 400MHz.  That gives us 26TMACs per second, which is 52Tops per second (a MAC is one multiply and one add which equals two operations).  So one TRIP would give us 52Tops and two of them would give us 104Tops.  This is assuming perfect utilization.  Actual utilization is unlikely to be higher than 95% and probably closer to 75%.  Still, it‚Äôs a formidable amount of processing for neural network applications.  Lets go with 75% utilization, which gives us 40Tops per TRIP or 80Tops total.

As a point of reference - Google‚Äôs TPU V1, which is the one that Google uses to actually *run* neural networks (the other versions are optimized for training) is very similar to the specs I‚Äôve outlined above.  From Google‚Äôs published data on that part we can tell that the estimates above are reasonable - probably even conservative.  Google‚Äôs part is 700MHz and benchmarks at 92Tops peak in actual use processing convolutional neural networks.  That is the same kind of neural network used by Tesla in autopilot.  One likely difference is going to be onboard memory - Google‚Äôs TPU has 27MB but Tesla would likely want a lot more than that because they want to run much heavier layers than the ones that the TPU was optimized for.  I‚Äôd guess they need at least 75MB to run AKNET_V9.  All my estimates assume they have budgeted enough onboard SRAM to avoid having to dump intermediate results back to DRAM - which is probably a safe bet.

With that performance level, the HW3 neural nets that I see in this could be run at 1000 frames per second (all cameras simultaneously).  This is massive overkill.  There‚Äôs little reason to run much faster than 40fps for a driving application.  The previously noted AKNET_V9 ‚Äúmonster‚Äù neural network requires something like 600 billion MACs to process one frame.  So a single ‚ÄúTRIP‚Äù, using the estimated performance above, could run AKNET_V9 at 66 frames per second. This is closer to the sort of performance that would make sense and AKNET_V9 would be about the size of network one would expect to see running on the trip given the above assumptions.‚Äù

People who buy performance Model S‚Äôs are completely different that those who buy Model 3 and Model Y‚Äôs. In his tweet he clearly specified that 3/Y will not be getting this powertrain.

If anything this might slightly reduce Model S sales slightly but the reason they announced it was to kill the Taycan hype. So yes, less people buying current Model S but also less people buying Taycan and holding off purchase until P100D+ which in the long run would be good for Tesla.

TeslaMotors,missing,4d2c56,"How the Model 3 is ridiculously cheap over its lifetime compared with equivalent ICE. Math is shown. Am I missing anything here, or is it this obvious?","Point 1. The average lifespan of a car is 200,000 miles^1 

Point 2. Assume you use a supercharger or destination charger for a fourth of your miles^2 (which costs zero), and the other three quarters is done at your home. At 12 cents per KwH^3 and 3.5 miles per KwH^4, it costs *$5,150* to charge a Model 3 for 200,000 miles. 

Point 3. The 5-year average price of gas is $3.36^5 and the average MPG is 25.3^6, so an ICE car costs *$26,600* in gas over its lifetime.


So this means when you subtract the gasoline savings, the energy for a Model 3 costs $21,450 less over its lifetime than the average ICE vehicle.

$35,000 (the base price of the Model 3) minus $21,450 equals *$13,550*. **It's like buying an equivalent ICE car for $13,550!**

And I'm not even counting the hassle of repairs and maintenance like oil changes, exhaust systems, tune ups, etc.

This makes the Model 3 a ridiculously cheap car when you look at the total cost of ownership. 

It seems like the biggest no-brainer ever. Am I missing anything in my analysis?

TeslaMotors,missing,ap5oe0,We might be missing the true application of the Maxwell super-capacitors.,"So, we keep focusing on the cars and how we could get more energy out of them, or push more energy into the motors for faster acceleration. But what if the real intended application for the Super capacitors is for the Super and Mega chargers?

My reasoning is that present charging speeds aren‚Äôt always limited to the battery. Sometimes it‚Äôs because SCs are paired and run slower when they both are charging cars. It may also be limiting the number of SC deployments since each location needs 120KW supply per Supercharger (unless paired)

This problem will only get worse with Mega Chargers. The test semis already need to be tied into at least 4 SCs due to the higher capacity battery. Local surge demands won‚Äôt sit well with power companies as those loads are killers for their infrastructure.

So what if the Capacitors are intended to smooth out the load for the superchargers by storing an extra 20-100KWhs to dump into the next car? This could work even during peak usage as the capacitors can begin recharging once the battery becomes the speed limitation due to temp or SOC. It would also help to future-proof the SCs as they could keep up with faster charging capabilities of the next generation of batteries.

There is also the possibility that both the cars and trucks would have super capacitors onboard that would be used solely for charging. Car pulls in, plugs in, capacitors on charger rapidly dump into the capacitors onboard as well as the battery. Once the onboard capacitors are fully charged, the car can leave while the onboard capacitors finish pushing power into the batteries.

If the capacitor to capacitor transfer can happen in 5 minutes, then ICE cars no longer have any advantage. And gasoline usage as we know it is gone for good.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ap5oe0/we_might_be_missing_the_true_application_of_the/,Tseeker99,2633.0,0.5386

TeslaMotors,missing,eztiow,FordPass‚Ñ¢ Charging Network VS. Tesla Charging Network,"I have a friend who is a ""Ford guy"", and every time I talk about Tesla, he ""throws in my face"" that Ford has the largest charging network in the country. Ignoring the fact that you can't even buy a fully electric Ford at this point (Mach-E isn't available yet), I wanted to try and get to the bottom of this claim.

The Culprit: [Official Ford announcement ""North America's Largest Electric Vehicle Charging network.""](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2019/10/17/ford-introduces-north-americas-largest-electric-vehicle-charting-network.html)

Several media sites have created their own articles based on this announcement, that Ford has the largest network of EV charging sites. This is very misleading because if you go to [Ford's EV charging locator map](https://www.ford.com/buy-site-wide-content/overlays/try-the-tech/), you'll quickly discover that their ""network"" of chargers are simply [Chargepoints](https://www.chargepoint.com/), [Electrify America](https://www.electrifyamerica.com/index), [Greenlots](https://greenlots.com/), and other third-party charging networks. **Ford has zero exclusive charging stations.**

Most of the charging locations in the FordPass‚Ñ¢ Charging Network are public stations where you can ***also charge a Tesla***. *(EDIT: Some people have pointed out that Teslas can't charge at ALL of the same chargers as the Mach-E, for instance, due to adaptor restrictions.)* Therefore, Tesla clearly has the largest network of chargers when you add their Supercharger and Destination charger network. Ford is implying that they have a superior exclusive network over Tesla, and that's just false. All they did is pay these companies a licensing fee so they can call their chargers part of the FordPass‚Ñ¢ Charging Network. The only benefit offered by Ford is two years of ""access"" to the network, but you still have to pay for all your electricity. *(EDIT: Some people have mentioned that the Ford network offers a discount on charging at these stations, but I haven't found a source to back up this claim.)*

>Ford is providing two years of complimentary ***access*** to North America's largest network ‚Äì the FordPass Charging Network ‚Äì for easy and convenient ***pay-as-you-drive*** charging.

I don't even see a benefit of ""complementary access"", because [Chargepoint membership is free](https://www.chargepoint.com/drivers/), and it gives you access to 80% of other Level 2 (AC) networks and 99% of DC fast chargers. You pay for the electricity, of course, just like you would through the Ford program. 

Am I missing something, or is this a blatant low effort marketing tactic?",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/eztiow/fordpass_charging_network_vs_tesla_charging/,joeyisnotmyname,72528.0,0.9254
TeslaMotors,missing,y2bwo8,Things I wish my Model 3 had,"I have a 2020 M3P with over 50K miles on it and have driving across the USA several times and here is what I'd like to see in no specific order or priority:

\- Bring back radar, Vision SUCKS. Way more phantom braking events, and autopilot slows down in foggy conditions when with radar it did not. Also, radar would show cars in front of me 2 or 3 deep, now with vision, all I see is the one in front on my visualization screen. Although, vision seems to do a better job at lane-keeping. So, a hybrid radar/vision might be best. It‚Äôs so bad that I rarely use autopilot anymore because when I do, I‚Äôm always on edge, ready to unintentionally brake check someone at a moment‚Äôs notice. You know a function is badly designed when the user is incentivized to NOT use that function. One of the biggest reasons I and probably most people bought Tesla was because of autopilot, and now it‚Äôs degraded to the point of not using it. 

\- Implement a dumb cruise control that only keeps the speed constant like every other car. I don't want phantom braking and making people angry behind me who think I brake checked them, I don't want to slow down in foggy conditions or around curves, I don't want lane keeping, I don't want distance keeping, I don't want 85 MPH to be my top limit. I just want the speed kept constant as if I had my foot on the accelerator and nothing else. 

\- Allow switching of accelerations speeds by tapping the ""chill"" word, just like tapping the battery changes it from % to miles. Or have different driving profiles available at the tap of a button, like the M buttons on BMW M cars. I don‚Äôt want to change my entire Driver profile to do this. 

\- Fix the music UI where half the song's name and band can't be seen even though there is plenty of real estate in the music bar. Show the time/time remaining in the song instead of just having the status bar at the bottom. 

\- Allow us to turn on/off the driver and passenger HVAC independently. I know you can change temps on both sides independently, but sometimes I just want mine on when there is not passenger or when my passenger doesn't want air in their face without having to change the direction of the air flow every time. 

\- Speaking of HVAC, for the love of God get rid of that stupid SLIDER to change fan speed. It‚Äôs thin and very hard to use while driving. It obviously didn‚Äôt go through real world driving tests. Go back to having large + or ‚Äì buttons to change it. In fact, make all buttons large and easily accessible and get rid of any sliders anywhere. 

\- Get rid of the auto-wipers and auto-high beams when in autopilot. I hate when I have no control over functions of the car. If vision requires both to be on, then vision isn't good. Go back to radar and keep ultrasonics. 

\- If possible, give the M3P a slight acceleration boost, even if at the top end. There used to be a large gap between the M3P and M3LR, which is what distinguished the two and why people paid a premium for it. Track mode is a nice distinction, but not enough. The acceleration boost for the LR was a money grab and diminished the value of the M3P. I know they don't want to eat into Model S sales, but people who get the Model S/X are probably more into the luxury aspect that pure speed (I could be wrong). 

\- Go back to the Apple IOS style UI/Icons and not this Android looking one. It doesn't fit the aesthetic of the car. 

\- Allow customization of how many ""clicks"" a turn signal includes. 3 is way too short

\- Allow us to have different ‚Äústyles‚Äù of UI. For example, I could have a Road-trip style, which increases the map size and gets rid of the 3D car animation. I could have a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù style, which shows speed and gear and that‚Äôs it. You get the idea. Many cars do this already by emphasizing speed, or RPMs, or oil pressures, etc. on their digital displays with the click of a button. 

\- In addition to Chill/Normal/Sport/Ludicrous modes, have a purely ECO one where all but necessary functions are turned off to maximize range and efficiency. 

\- It was nice allowing us to change the color of our 3D model, but if we added assets for aftermarket taillights or other wheels, that would be cool. It could even be something others create, and we can upload via thumb drive. It‚Äôs weird to see my 3D model with the wrong wheels and taillights since I got both replaced. 

\- Why is the walk-away door lock sound the horn honking? Tesla‚Äôs have external speakers, so make it a pleasant locking sound like other EVs do and not this loud obnoxious honk. Even the reverse humming sound is more pleasant than the honk. I hate coming home at night to my apartment and having my car honk. I could turn off the walk-away door honk, but that isn‚Äôt the point. I shouldn‚Äôt have to not use a function because it sucks. That is indicative of the function itself needing fixing. 

\- Allow retrofitting for powered frunk/trunks, new center console, heated steering wheels, and other upgrades just like they are doing with the CCS adapter. In fact, my Tesla SC is installed the newer side repeaters because I asked them to. They don‚Äôt suffer from the blinkers blinding them at night and have better low-light visibility. It‚Äôs a $350 retrofit though. 

\- Tesla needs to be more open to and more responsive when allowing other auto shops to buy Tesla parts. My go-to auto guy could not get certain parts from Tesla SC no matter how many times he reached out. But when I scheduled an appointment with the SC, they magically had the parts ready to go. 

\- STOP removing functions in a car I already paid for. This is the double-edged sword of OTA updates. We get more cool features and more power, but on the flip side, we lose some functionality like radar and ultrasonics. Imagine buying a cellphone with certain functions and later the manufacturer removes some of those functions even with the necessary hardware still installed. Now imagine some of those functions were big reasons you bought the cellphone. And you have no say in rejecting these updates or risk being out of warranty. Totally unacceptable for a $50k plus car. 

\- If Tesla removes features in an update, they should refund the owner for said removed functions. Like removing Alcantara headliner on later Model 3s. Now it‚Äôs this cheap beige fabric garbage. Not ‚Äúluxury‚Äù at all. Or removing radar/ultrasonics. I paid for that hardware and functionality and dammit I want to use it. 

\- Why are some features on my state-of-the-art electric vehicle not available that are available on some other cheap cars? Ventilated seats? 360-degree vision? Lowering the sound when a phone call comes in? 

\- Need more factory paint options. 9/10 Teslas I see on the road are white and it‚Äôs so damn boring and monotonous. Wraps are expensive and don‚Äôt last forever. A full paint job is even more expensive. 

Overall, amazing car in its totality, literally revolutionary. I know all the above fixes can‚Äôt and likely won‚Äôt be changed, but you never know. Some might be hardware and software limited in some way I‚Äôm not aware of, but then again, I‚Äôm not a Tesla engineer. This is coming from purely a user experience perspective.

I had to beg and plead for a loaner vehicle which was a pickup truck from Enterprise because the service center had no Tesla loaners to offer. Even at that, I was still pushed to accept Uber credits.

TeslaMotors,missing,5q17af,"Am I Missing Something on ""Tesla Killers""?","I'm really having a hard time understanding people's viewpoints everytime I see an article get published that mentions that an upcoming vehicle is going to be a ""Tesla Killer"" or will ""Steal Tesla's Customers"", for example, most recently I read how Chevrolet beat Tesla to the punch with the Chevy Bolt, but what exactly have they done? The only thing I can see is that they have only produced an electric vehicle with greater range. If anything they have the BMW I3 beat, Tesla is to come out with ""at least"" 215 miles, I have no doubt in my mind that they will beat the 238 mile range that the bolt is currently boasting.

I don't understand how reporters are seriously comparing the two companies, it really is apples to oranges, and then we have the CEO of GM down talking Tesla as well which I really don't understand. I get that they are trying to tap into the more affordable electric vehicle market but I believe Tesla is beyond that.

Tesla doesn't make the standard car, they make future cars today. Yet somehow, their features (like autopilot) get left out in these comparisons of the bolt to the Model 3, as well as it's speed which Musk reported to be a 0-60 time of less than 6 seconds.

And then there are the comparisons between Faraday Future and Tesla, which is a fairer comparison but I am still not seeing how this is going to be a ""Tesla killer"".

TeslaMotors,missing,ooi0qy,"Might get blasted for this, but I think the hate against opening up the SC network is ridiculuous","Probably not a welcome opinion here, since I dont own a Tesla vehicle, only stock. But after reading through the recent threads on sharing the super charging network I'm turned away by the elitism and complaining. 

I 100 percent believe that Tesla opening the charging network is a carefully thought out decision, and not just an Elon meme.

I'll summarize for three quick reasons;

1. **Government grants** - Its fairly obvious to everyone by now that Tesla chases government money. Subsidies bring down the cost of vehicles and provided the upfront capita needed to compete against established automakers. Under the new Biden administration there is a huge fund planned to spur EV adoption, infrastructure and development, Tesla will not want to miss out on this chunk of change. Opening up the network is how Tesla proves they are contributing to the renewable vehicle infrastructure, that is how you go from pennies in subsidies, to big fat cheques to build new chargers.

2. **Charging standards are more competitive** - Tesla plug types account for the overwhelming majority in North America (around 25k last time I checked), however CCS is the standard world wide and not only is it what Tesla switched to in Europe due to regulations and consumer demand, but other standards like CHaDeMo are soon to be switched to CCS. Benefits and Cons for each standard aside, its clear the world governments want to settle on one standard, just like how you don't have to choose a different shaped nozzle when filling up your ICE vehicle, I shouldnt have to worry about what adapter to bring when charging.

3. **Its Tesla's motto, and will benefit Tesla owners and the EV industry** - Tesla has always aimed to make EVs mainstream, and that wasnt ever expected to be only through them in a monopolistic system. By sharing the network, it opens the door for other manufacturers vehicles to become more viable. It also surely forces other manufacturers to up their infrastructure rate so they dont lose their customers to charging at the nice shiny and convenient Tesla stalls (and possibly paying more to charge). I understand concerns about giving up competitive advantage, but you all need understand that this would have ended eventually. The EV market is only growing, and as more manufacturers started putting out their own chargers that all followed the CCS standard, Tesla would end up in a situation similar to the Apple lightning charger vs USB C. However in this case, it might end up worse for Tesla as they could be mandated by the government to switch to CCS without reaping any of the infrastructure fund benefits.

To close out, I get its annoying to share a crowded charging station with other non Tesla EV owners, but this kind of clanish attitude and elitism over other brands is what ends up pushing people away from Tesla. Just think about it, how would you feel if you used your adapter to charge at a non Tesla station and some dude in a Leaf rolled up and told you to f*** off?

Lets all cool off and look at this objectively, Tesla has not made this decision willy nilly, and at the end of the day they could roll it back all together and my post will look stupid.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ooi0qy/might_get_blasted_for_this_but_i_think_the_hate/,_Cubed,28939.0,0.9949
TeslaMotors,missing,cazbf3,Model 3 missing features,"Hey guys, 

My girlfriend recently got a new Bmw X1. It‚Äòs a dirty Ice car, i know, i tried to make her move to an electric vehicle but the leasing is just too cheap. She more or less has everything in the car (leather, HUD, big screen, m sport package, automatic trunk, etc) and only has to pay about 270 ‚Ç¨ a month. 

So here it is now, i am saving money at the moment for a model 3 and i‚Äòm a big Tesla fan, but of course i tried her new car. And i compared it to the model 3. Unfortunately, i have to admit that the X1 has some features that seem to be far better than Tesla‚Äòs.

All of them don‚Äòt move me to buying a Bmw, but these are the things that I‚Äòll probably miss as soon as i get a model 3.

- Hud
It‚Äòs just futuristic and convenient. Even if Elon doesn‚Äòt like it, i definitely do.

- steering wheel controls 
10 buttons ! 2 different scroll wheels, the right one is just ordinary, the left one allows me to jump up or down 10 kmh using the speed regulation with a kind of force touch, very convenient.
Tesla also has scroll wheels, but it seems like a pain in the ass to adjust speed from 40 to 80 kmh using these. And though 10 buttons are not really necessary, 4-6 are still just nice to have.

- idrive controller
It‚Äòs nice to use it in order to scroll through iphone playlists for example, Tesla doesn‚Äòt even show iPhone playlists on the screen, right ? 
It sounds like there‚Äòs no phone implementation at all (except phone calls and audio output)

- trunk automation
I know, it‚Äòs not a big deal, but now that i used it multiple times, i don‚Äòt want to miss it. But you can get it from a third party manufacturer for model 3, so problem solved.

- sport seats
I wish Tesla would offer the model s seats in the model 3 too for a little additional charge, more ore less the same that Bmw uses.

- adaptive light
again, not really necessary, but still nice to have ...

What bothers me most, is that these are no groundbreaking features. Tesla could simply add them, put some margin on it and sell them for some extra money.

Am i the only one who likes these things or do all of you who already own a Tesla think that these features bring no advantage ?

TeslaMotors,missing,1864wq2,"My thoughts on upgrading from a 2022 Model 3 Performance to a Model S (standard, not Plaid)","TLDR; If you are driving a Model 3 Performance, the base Model S with standard wheels is a *very* nice upgrade.

Context: I had a 2019 Model 3 Performance. Loved it. It was leased, so switched to a 2022 Model 3 Performance. The 2019 had better fit and finish than the 2022. The 2022's battery also degraded faster than the older car. I probably lucked out and got a peach 2019, but whatever. Both cars were excellent fun. That said, the crashy suspension was starting to annoy me, and I wanted more range. So got a base 2023 Model S with the standard wheels for range and comfort. Ordered Midnight Silver, it got changed to Stealth Grey.

So here are my thoughts on the differences between a Model 3 Performance and a standard Model S:

 - The Model S is much better looking (duh).
 - The fit and finish is pretty good - the panel gaps are a little wider than I would like, but I don't have any alignment issues. It is better than the Model 3 - my Model 3's trunk was slightly out of square, causing a slight jiggle when closing.
 - The initial paint quality is excellent. So was the Model 3. As to how it holds up over time, I do not know. I have PPF on the front.
 - The performance is similar. I know it is supposed to be a bit faster (same 0 to 60, but the Model S measures it without the 1 foot rollout) but the difference is too small to notice. They are both so, so fast.
 - The handling is good, but I can feel that the car is larger to drive. I have to pay a bit more attention to keep the car centered in the lane and when turning. As for actual handling, I don't drive at the limit, so both seem equally capable to me.
 - The S is *much* more comfortable! I knew that going in, but the difference is pretty stark. Now, I probably would have had better comfort if I had the standard wheels on my Model 3 rather than the larger performance wheels, but I still think the S is more comfortable.
 - The S is much quieter inside. Much less noise coming in from the outside. Overall just a nicer, more comfortable, quieter cabin.
 - Having the front instrument panel made zero difference to my life. I have no idea why auto journalists whine about needing a front IP.
 - I like the new gear selecting mechanism. The sliding up and down on the center panel is actually not bad at all. I was worried that I would hate it (I am a shorter person and worried about having to continuously reach for it) but no, works fine. Coupled with the automatic gear selection (where the car guesses the gear it should be in) it's a good solution. The *only* time I struggle is when I reverse in a parking lot, then have to reach over and move the slider up to move forward. That adds a couple hundred milliseconds to that process. On the whole I would still prefer a stalk but I feel like do get something with the new system.
 - Having the turning indicator buttons on the steering wheel is stupid, unsafe and aggravating to use. Using the buttons when you are driving straight and want to make a turn is simple. Anything else is hard to do because the buttons move with the wheels, which means you are never sure where they are. If you need to make several turns and lane changes in succession it is very disorienting and you end up clicking the wrong button or missing it entirely. The first company to offer a kit to add a turning stalk is getting my money. Honestly Tesla needs to retrofit these cars with a stalk. And bonus issue. When you are changing lanes, the signal automatically turns off after one lane change. So if you are making 2 lane changes in quick succession you *have* to use the turn signal twice. This whole thing is the single stupidest thing about this car. Comparing this to the Model 3 is moot, since the new Model 3 is getting the same garbage system.
 - The luggage space is better in the Model S. The trunk, the space under the trunk and the frunk are all larger.
 - I really like the center console - the multiple sliding mechanisms work well and help keep your stuff organized.
 - The carpets are plusher. Getting all weather mats so this really doesn't matter much to me.
 - Just overall the cabin is a nice upgrade over the Model 3 - all the materials seem a touch better.
 - Really like the rotating feature of the center screen. I have it oriented towards the driver and it does make a difference.
 - The larger screen is nice, but the Model 3 was pretty excellent in this regard as well.
 - The sound system in the Model 3 was very good, the one in the Model S is better.

That's all I can think off. Feel free to ask questions in the comments below if you care.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/1864wq2/my_thoughts_on_upgrading_from_a_2022_model_3/,syslog2000,17705.0,0.9991
TeslaMotors,missing,f1dlqh,Autopilot rewrite with 3d labeling is only starting to use FSD computer‚Äôs potential,"Elon Musk revealed a [foundational Autopilot rewrite](https://youtu.be/_a6lF2Ss3G4?t=81) to combine planning, perception and image recognition trained on 3d-labeled data, and this departs from primarily focusing on individually-labeled main camera frames that has worked great for highway Autopilot optimized for HW2. This is likely to address the remaining concerns back in October from [2019 Q3 earning call](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/24/tesla-inc-tsla-q3-2019-earnings-call-transcript.aspx): ‚ÄúNow we need to work on solving the intermediate portion which is traffic lights and stop signs, and navigating through ‚Ä¶ windy narrow roads in suburban neighborhoods.‚Äù

Notably windy roads are difficult because the lane edges can leave the view of the main camera, and similarly traffic lights and stop signs can be hard to see from the stop line when using only the main camera. Here‚Äôs a screenshot from a [greentheonly video](https://youtu.be/OdKA5Y7nXMY?t=25) where Fisheye camera has enough vision to predict the yellow lines while Main camera barely sees the right edge of the destination lane and fails to make a lane prediction.

[View greentheonly city neural network output screenshot](https://preview.redd.it/z03juk7l3yf41.jpg?width=2240&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2983ccfd493730bc4c20e384c7f486c7f8c59603)

Also from greentheonly videos, you can count the frames between neural network updates where Main camera updates every frame while all other cameras update every 4th frame. This sampling is likely limited by Autopilot optimized for HW2 to handle 99 total frames per second using up \~90% of the compute budget. But with FSD computer having 21 times the capacity, this sampled frame rate is only \~5% of the budget, and going to full 36 frame per second from 8 cameras would increase to \~14% of compute. (For reference, a 4-frame delay = 111ms at 60mph/100km/h highway speeds is 10 feet/3 meters.)

One main benefit of FSD computer treating all cameras equally means the neural network can make a unified prediction based on the combined vision instead of having the neural network make individual predictions for some frames then post-process stitching together that information. Again referring to the greentheonly screenshot, notice how Left Pillar labels Bus ID 29 but misses it in Fisheye while L. Truck is ID 2 in Imm-Left Lane from Left Pillar conflicts with ID 21 in My Lane from Fisheye. These conflicting neural network outputs makes it undesirable to write code to decide which outputs to trust vs discard, so that‚Äôs why current Autopilot just simply favors information from Main camera, e.g., predicted path, traffic light color visualizations.

To be clear, this ""all camera Autopilot"" should fill in the prediction gaps of Main camera by seamlessly using Fisheye camera and Pillar cameras as necessary. So windy roads and just-out-of-sight green lights shouldn't be a problem anymore, and this should also fix visualization issues of duplicate vehicles from multiple cameras as well as smoothly slowing down for stopped vehicles seen earlier by Narrow camera.

&#x200B;

Last June at [International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)](https://slideslive.com/38917690/multitask-learning-in-the-wilderness), Andrej Karpathy mentioned compute budget constraints on the design of the neural network architecture leading to the multi-task structure needing separate outputs stitched together. Below is his slide showing path prediction using two heads (unlabeled shaded rectangles at the top) that pull data from different sets of cameras, and potentially the architecture with the rewrite is to have a single path prediction head based on all cameras, and likely many other aspects of the architecture have been combined and simplified with the rewrite.

[View Karpathy path prediction architecture](https://preview.redd.it/85sezo6p3yf41.png?width=1662&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c649cfd07ff52ce8e6da433e9b7f74575261ac4)

Karpathy also showed at [PyTorch DevCon](https://youtu.be/oBklltKXtDE?t=279) late last year a top-down road layout prediction directly from a recurrent neural network instead of needing traditional C++ code to stitch up multiple image-space predictions. So the rewrite seems to be reassessing previous constraints and moving to the next level of taking advantage of FSD computer‚Äôs additional compute budget to use all cameras to make 3d-labeled predictions that also leverages Tesla‚Äôs ability to gather a lot of training data at 288 frames per second.

&#x200B;

Even when improving existing predictions by using all cameras at full frame rate, FSD computer still has a lot more capacity for more outputs. If one considers ""Autopilot optimized for HW2"" as using 5% of FSD computer capability providing quite amazing highway driving feature today, and the ""all camera Autopilot"" using 15%, it's exciting to think of what Tesla + FSD computer can do with the remaining compute for ""5 additional"" features that match the complexity the ""all camera Autopilot.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/f1dlqh/autopilot_rewrite_with_3d_labeling_is_only/,harikaried,3846.0,0.9877

Given that QLD sees a lot of sun throughout the year, this seems like it would be quite economically viable considering the money they would save from generating their own power, not to mention the ability to power their house through grid failures.

However, when Elon announced the Solar Roof, he said that ‚ÄúThe apples-to-apples comparison compared to a regular roof will be at least at, and we believe slightly below the cost of a regular roof, and the electricity is just a bonus.‚Äù

After doing a little bit of research (using $USD prices and converting as $AUD hasn't been announced yet), it would seem that the cost of a Tesla Solar Roof is in fact roughly 2-3 times the price of normal tiled roof.

* 13,190 Model X

Model 3 not only did well, but Model S and Model X deliveries were also both significantly higher quarter-over-quarter¬†(those numbers are adjusted slightly¬†during the release of the earnings).

Here are Tesla‚Äôs quarterly global deliveries of all current vehicles in production since their launches:

**Revenue**

Wall Street‚Äôs revenue consensus is $5.667 billion for the quarter and¬†[Estimize](https://www.estimize.com/tsla?show_confirm=true#chart=historical), the financial estimate crowdsourcing website, predicts a significantly higher revenue of $5.993 billion.

They are both predicting an almost 100% revenue growth over the same period last year and a significant, almost $2 billion increase quarter-over-quarter.

[https://i.imgur.com/hjmN9VK.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/hjmN9VK.jpeg)

Of course, the increase is not surprising considering the record Model 3 deliveries and the still strong Model S and Model X deliveries.

Tesla‚Äôs energy division could still surprise us and make a difference, but it is unlikely to be a game-changer compared to the sheer volume of vehicle revenue.

**Earnings**

Earnings per share, or loss per share, is the big unknown this quarter.

The Wall Street consensus is a loss of $0.53 per share for the quarter, while Estimize‚Äôs¬†prediction is a loss of $0.14 per share.

While the expectation is still a loss, it‚Äôs a much smaller loss than in previous quarters and the range is much bigger here. Many still expect that Tesla could announce a profit.

Around the end of the quarter, Musk did write to employees that they were close to profitability, but it hasn‚Äôt been confirmed since the end of the quarter last month.

**Other expectations for the** **shareholders letter and analyst call**

Obviously, we expect that a fair amount of the conference call and shareholders letter will revolve around Model 3 production and how it has evolved recently.

Tesla has reached its overall production goal for the quarter, but as we reported in our tracking of weekly production, the company missed its goal to have a production rate of 6,000 Model 3 vehicles per week.

Investors and analysts are going to want to have a clearer path to Tesla‚Äôs production ramp and its ultimate goal of 10,000 units per week.

With profitability in mind, we are likely to hear more about the Model 3 gross margin and how it has evolved in the past months.

Tesla had incredible growth this quarter, but investors will want to know how the company can keep growing.

The automaker‚Äôs[¬†Gigafactory 3 in China](https://electrek.co/2018/07/10/tesla-gigafactory-3-china-official-production/)¬†is expected to be a big factor in enabling growth.

As we reported earlier this week, [land grading already started at the site](https://electrek.co/2018/10/23/diy-ebike-1kw-fat-tire-snow-bike/) that they secured in Shanghai. Tesla said that they are accelerating their construction plan and I am sure investors and analysts are going to want a new timeline.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9r1iru/tesla_tsla_third_quarter_2018_results_and/,FredTesla,163135.0,0.9927
TeslaMotors,missing,8jj794,Factors that people who argue new longrange EVs will out-compete Tesla miss:,"1) Factor number one that many who argue that the new EVs coming will compete with Tesla miss is, is in order to manufacture large amounts of EVs on the scale of model 3 is you need a battery supply almost equal to the entire Li-ion battery production of 2015. Tesla has been building their gigafactory for the past 4 years just to have enough batteries to produce the model 3 at scale. Does the I-Pace or any of the other long range EVs coming soon, have a large enough battery supply? How many I-Paces will be sold a month? How many pre-orders does it have? 

2) Take the GM Bolt. Tesla is already outselling the GM Bolt 3:1. Why is that. One factor is battery supply. (Another factor is battery cost - rumor has it GM is losing money on each Bolt sold. Battery cost comes down with increased R&D and economies of scale). 

3) A third factor is charging infrastructure. It has taken Tesla about 5 years to reach the level of charging infrastructure they have today. Can competing EVs catch up with this infrastructure easily?

 4) EVs make up less than 1% of cars made today. As EVs come down in cost, EVs will take market-share from ICE cars , not just from competing EVs. In other words legacy car-makers EVs will be competing with their OWN ICE vehicles. 

5: ICE cars are sold by dealerships who a large percentage of their revenue comes from repairs. Will dealerships be happy to push customers to EVs knowing that their revenue from repairs may be slashed? In essence the I-Pace will be competing with Jaguar's own ICEs. 

Time will tell how successful the I-Pace and other future EVs will be. The lackluster GM Bolt sales may shed some light on what to expect.Ôªø",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/8jj794/factors_that_people_who_argue_new_longrange_evs/,ZalmanR1,60657.0,0.782

Was cleaning around the wheel wells with my pressure washer and noticed on the rear wheel wells on both sides that there are 3 holes in the lining that's missing screws. Spoke to someone on the Tesla Chat and was told that if you call the SC, they can pop in the rivets without appointment. Arrived at my SC and spoke to the service guy and I was told the last time my vehicle came in, they actually removed it as there's more than enough clips holding in the lining. He told me the reasoning for removing them is because when the rivets are present, when the lining moves too much, it tends to start a rip in the lining. 

&#x200B;

My question being, why did the Tesla Chat Rep tell me I can have those put back on but the SC said they're removing it from cars that come in for service?",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/cjdm6b/noticed_rivetsbolts_missing_in_wheel_well/,DaSixOhFour,4058.0,-0.1779

TeslaMotors,missing,4ebuwl,Missing binnacle theory,"I know the lack of driver instrument cluster is a hotly contested topic, and it seems people either passionately love it (my position) or they passionately hate it. But, I just had a thought.


During one of the ride-along videos there was a throw away line about the steering wheel not being the final design. When you consider the fact that the final steering device will be released during ""part 2"", and the fact that Elon says the lack of binnacle will make sense after ""part 2"" of the release, it makes one wonder.

So, my theory based on absolutely nothing but the above two points is that the steering device will contain some amount of the information people believe is ""missing"" from the virtual gauge cluster.

TeslaMotors,missing,5drmoy,Tesla Upcoming Possible Features Missed by Ordering Now,"As many others, I'm strongly considering ordering a new Model S 60 this weekend to take advantage of the following:  
-$2k price increase on November 22nd and $1k referral credit (and cheap interest rates)  
-Free Supercharging (like it or not)  
-Full tax credits available for 2016 tax year (getting in before Republicans take over the 3 branches of government)  
-AP2.0 with possibility for full self-driving someday with this hardware  
-Software limited 60kWh with 75kWh hardware (don't know if this will be offered for the long run, or cancelled quietly like the Model X 60D)  

Options I'm looking at:  
-Sunroof  
-Enhanced Autopilot  

Options I'm Not Planning on:  
-D (in SoCal this car will never see snow and rarely see rain)  
-UHFS (the standard audio system sounded good enough to my non-audiophile years)  
-Rear Facing Seats (no plans on having children within the next few years)  
-Subzero Weather Package (again, SoCal)  
-Smart Air Suspension (no interest from me)  
-Premium Upgrades Package (possibly interested in ventilated seats, but nothing else in the package)  
-Leather Seats (I prefer cloth with SoCal weather)

Now the question I'm wondering is what I'll miss by ordering now and receiving the car at the end of this year.  I know it's impossible to predict, and likely won't affect my purchase.  I can't imagine what it must feel like to receive the first batch of the P100DL but then missing on AP2.0 right after.  I don't care about battery size (200 miles is enough for my needs), nor the possibility of heads up display.  I did put the preorder deposit for the Model 3 as soon as the stores opened back in March, but I'm considering accelerating my purchase to a Model S now for the various reasons listed above.

Location: Los Angeles/ Orange County

If I do decide to take the leap, hopefully I will be able to sell my 2015 LEAF SV w/QC+LED package for a better price than Carmax offered.

Love  my model 3, but the rattles got to me.  In working my  passenger front door panel, I noticed one of the 8-9 clips is missing.  I also noticed that one of the speaker grille attachment points is also broken so it's not latching to the door fully.  I don't know which is causing the rattle but my  car has never been worked on (in the door anyway), so I have to assume  it came from factory like this.

I  couldn't find any retailer that sells the door clips.  I saw a post  about Tesla for $8 per clip and thought maybe someone had some internet  magic for me.  I also couldn't even find the speaker grille with a  separate code in the parts catalog.  Maybe I'm out of luck with that  one?

TeslaMotors,missing,fj2pl4,@ElonMusk @Tesla How not to miss out on the Dutch EV rebate,"In the Netherlands, as of 1 July there will be a 4k rebate for EVs for regular people (in contrast to BIK which is not available to them). To be eligible for the rebate, the maximum price of the EV is E45, which is lower than the SR plus.

AFAIK, in Canada Tesla has faced a similar situation, and Tesla sold EVs with a restricted range which could be unlocked with a post-purchase fee.

This approach could be used in the Netherlands. To make the SR+ BASIC offer more enticing, the limited range (e.g. 175 or 200 km) could be a **guaranteed** range (at a max speed of 105 km/h), that is irrespective of the temperature. Thus, people driving this locked down version would not have to suffer from range anxiety (even if only doing highway driving or in cold), unlike other eligible EVs which while having longer advertised ranges, wouldn't be able to meet them by far because they are WLTP ranges. The underused capacity of the Model 3 battery would guarantee this range. This would be a unique selling point, apart from the fact that you can upgrade the car later on to get an even longer range whereas with the competition you're stuck with the (WLTIP) range you buy.

ADDED: The range could be advertised as still guaranteed in 10 years (meeting the worry some people have about battery degradation). This would make the BASIC version more competitive with EVs from other brands.

To make the upgrade package to regular SR+ more enticing, the BASIC version could have the following limitations:

&#x200B;

\- the top speed could be reduced to 140 km/h (enough safety margin if one has to overtake another car).

\- The 0-60 could be 2.5 seconds slower (so still relatively speedy as the BASIC version still has to be competitive if not upgraded).

\- Pay 50% more at the supercharger (still cheaper than Ionity, a leading company for roadside charging).",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/fj2pl4/elonmusk_tesla_how_not_to_miss_out_on_the_dutch/,ReddBert,40334.0,-0.5461

TeslaMotors,missing,lu53sf,Renewing my Toyota RAV4 lease.... or how I bought a Model Y.,"Bear with me... it‚Äôs long and I need to get it out!

I have a month left in my Rav4.  My Toyota‚Äôs have been  ridiculously reliable.  The Rav isn‚Äôt anything fancy and today I went to just lease another one. I wanted the same model, keep it simple. My old neighbor is the salesman, or should have been had he not gotten Covid and is still recovering. No big deal, he will call ahead any make sure they take care of me.  Tells me to see Sam. 

I show up and ask for Sam. He hands me to someone else (strike 1). This tool never gives me his name (strike 2). I‚Äôm already fuming, I ask for the same model but want to test drive because Toyota put an electronically controlled continuous variable trans in it ( had one in a Chevy and it was horrible). I drive it... it drives like crap. He gets me a hybrid model with more bells and whistles to test, this drives really nice. I ask him how much. Come back with $598!!  It wasnt that nice!  He says ‚Äúwell my manger want to know what number is good for you‚Äù. It‚Äôs a lease!!!!  Since when do they attempt to deal on a lease!!  He starts all the typical car salesman crap (strike 3). I‚Äôm done. Tell him I‚Äôll get back to him. They offer the find the model down that‚Äôs cheaper but want $500 to do that. 

I leave. My wife knows I want a Tesla. She convinces to go look at least. 

We show up to dealer, no pressure from the get go, test drive the 3 and Y. It drives 100 times better then the Rav. He goes over everything I ask. There‚Äôs no pressure to buy, no pressure to upsell. He already convinced the kids.  I‚Äôm sold. The buying process simple the worst part is the wait, but that‚Äôs only a week. I didn‚Äôt care about color and they had a long distance Black on the way to the dealer this week. It‚Äôs now mine. 
In the end I‚Äôm paying $50 LESS then the fancy Rav4 and I‚Äôm getting more features. I didn‚Äôt get the FSD but outside of no Apple CarPlay it‚Äôs has MORE.

TeslaMotors,missing,552wlx,Thinking that a Bolt and III are the same because they're both EV misses the point,"With all the comparisons between the Bolt and the III it's interesting how few actually focus on the point. Yes, both companies *will* produce (have no idea how the GM marketing has escaped it being called a hybrid) an electric car, but that's, in many ways, not the big deal. To me, you've got a software/hardware producing a car vs. a car company producing electronics and software and it's *that* distinction that people should be buying on. 

The approach between the two companies couldn't be more different and it shows in both how the cars evolve AFTER you buy them and the aggressive nature each takes to tackle the next problem. Does anyone really think that GM would be rolling out such ambitious changes to AP in cars that are already out there? No. I've been amazed to see how Tesla's keep getting betting in a world where *maybe* you *might* get a firmware update to handle a nasty bug, but you'll need to take it to the dealership and have them load up a USB drive and do magic (other car companies).

The first update was 2019.36.x and 2019.40.x at the same time und a few days ago the big ""christmas"" update. Now I know that the German/EU version of the Tesla software is not always the same as the US version, e.g. smart summon was only released with the latest update and not with V10 in september. That can happen due to regulatory issues or simple differences between countries. The same is true for the FSD visualizations, I get it, that traffic lights work and look differently in Germany.

TeslaMotors,missing,pp1hxd,First time driving an EV. HOLY MOLEY!,"Hello Everyone,

Today my wife and I test drove a Model Y Long Range. Not only was it my first time driving a Tesla, it was my first time driving an EV. This wasn't a performance version, but man what a kick in the ass that car is. It was up to 100mph is nuthin' flat. I can't even imagine what driving a Plaid must be like.. 

We dropped by the Superior, CO location while I was on my lunch break. Like a Crack Dealer, Tesla doesn't really ""sell"" these cars but ""offers"" them. The rep we spoke with did the usual walk around of a floor model. We immediately got a massive laugh out of the ""Romantic Mode"".  My wife was giggling like a school girl.  

So my other impressions/questions. 

* Man this thing really has A LOT of cargo space. That was very surprising. 
* The seats take a little getting used to but man that white is something else. If I get one, I think I'll go for a blue exterior with those white seats.
* No CarPlay is kinda disappointing, but this is mostly because there is no Waze to warn me of any cops ahead. That is something I'll miss but my wife pointed out that the phone sits nicely on the charging pad and we could still run Waze on that. I was thinking it would be cool if AutoPilot could look down the road and give you a heads up if it notices a police car. It could also tell you if one comes up behind you from a highway on ramp. 
* Obviously the car was super quiet on the highway but the tires and suspension do transmit a lot of noise into the cabin. 
* No spare tire is a little concerning. I'd like some feedback on that. The Tesla rep did a great job of explaining why. That was very reasonable and roadside assistance would help with any tire change. But what if we're in Colorado's mountains and out of cell phone coverage. How do we get service at that point? Also, do they repair a tire with minor damage right there or do they give you a loaner wheel and tire? I'm looking for any gotchas.
* I'm sure lots of people say this, but regen braking will take some getting used to. Especially since our other vehicle is a Jeep Wrangler. 
* Does anyone know if the Model Y can handle a rooftop tent with two or three people? I have an iKamper xCover, which may be a bit too big. I haven't investigated this yet. 

On Monday I get to check out a Ford F150 Lightning. I've got an early reservation for one, so I'm fairly sure I'll have the option to actually order one. I also have a Cybertruck reservation but that's a very late one so I don't think I'll be able to get one for quite a while. I may buy an F150 and keep it for a couple years, then get a Cybertruck. But after driving a Model Y, I may say screw it and lease that for a while before getting a CT. I will probably have to make a decision soon on the Ford. Orders are expected to open this fall.

TeslaMotors,missing,85ajxa,A detailed review of Model 3 from a M3 owner.,"Context: I'm currently a happy owner of an [F80 M3](https://i.imgur.com/kplaltD.jpg), and over the years I've owned a [F30 335i](https://i.imgur.com/edTsvFR.jpg) and an E92 335i. I've driven pretty much all the cars in this segment, namely the BMW 3-series, the C43 AMG, the Audi S4 and S5, and the new Alfa Romeo Giulia.

Well, today I was able to borrow [this baby](https://imgur.com/qFXj4Nq) and spent a day driving it on mountain roads, within San Francisco, and cruise it down 101. Here are my impressions. I'm going to score individual categories relative to other competitors in this class, so I won't be rating the Model 3's cost against a Civic, its luxury against a S class, or its handling against a 911.

**Drivetrain (9/10):**

Modern ICE drivetrains are quite good, especially in the premium sports sedan segment. Max torque reached at very low RPM from the new turbo engines, silky smooth shift from the ZF-8 gearboxes, and some of them even manage to sound good (i,e C43 AMG). But the Model 3 beats pretty much all competitors in these categories (ok maybe not sound), with 0-30 performance that feels as fast as my M3. Instant max torque at 0 rpm and no gear shift makes this car a performance star around town, especially in local driving. One point is deducted due to Model 3's power/torque falls off quite noticeably at around 55 mph and above. Still not slow by any means, but do lag behind some of the competitors in this segment.

**Steering (8/10):**

The Model 3 has really direct steering that's quite nicely weighted (more so than the Model S), and even has a bit of that steering feedback many modern cars with electric racks lack. The ratio is not as stupidly quick as the Alfa Romeo Giulia (maybe a good thing), but felt very comparable to my last 335i. Two point being deducted for the steering weight doesn't increase in a predicable linear fashion as you keep turning. It does get heavier as turn-in increases, but not as much as I'd liked and it doesn't provide as much confidence near the limit as the best in this class.

**Suspension/Chassis (9.5/10):**

Yep, that's an almost perfect score, and in my opinion as a sports sedan, the Model 3 is among the cream of the crop in this already sporty segment. It manages to be supple *and* sharp at the same time, and is able to offer some good feedback from the road without trying to set you up with your local chiropractor. It's obviously not as hardcore/razor sharp as my M3 (and no, it doesn't make the Giulia feel like ""wet sponge""), but it's extremely well balanced and reminds me of BMW's best days. 

Some people may find the ride a bit too ""harsh"", but I personally applaud Tesla for having the courage to make a sports sedan actually sporty, instead of just making a land yacht with good acceleration. BMW, maybe you should use some of those SUV profits to build actual ""Ultimate Driving Machines"" again.

All of this is combined with the low center of gravity from the battery pack, which resulted in probably the least amount of body roll in this segment. However it's not a perfect 10 because weight *can* be felt at higher cornering speed and it was obvious the car's tires are quite limiting factors.

**Interior Quality/Fit and Finish (5/10):**

Before I talk about anything else, I want to bring up the steering wheel, or rather how ugly it is. The [Model S](https://images.hgmsites.net/lrg/2013-tesla-model-s-4-door-sedan-steering-wheel_100466393_l.jpg) has a handsome and premium looking steering wheel, my M3 has [real aluminum trim and contrast stitching leather](https://imgur.com/a/Tkqkx), and the Audi S4 has a steering wheel that resembles [that of a racecar](http://image.superstreetonline.com/f/144382304+w+h+q80+re0+cr1+ar0+st0/2017-audi-s4-live-interior.jpg). Meanwhile the Model 3's steering wheel looks like an [afterthought](https://i.imgur.com/uzXoU7W.jpg) that Tesla engineers reluctantly put in last minute because they couldn't get Full Self Driving to work.

Interior materials were decent. The wood trim felt premium, but was marred by aluminum colored plastic around it. Most of the plastic were soft to touch and the synthetic leather felt ok as well. But this segment is extremely competitive and even [KIA](https://i.imgur.com/tISHJNh.jpg) started using top end materials everywhere. Minimalism is a design choice that's subjective, but material quality is an objective benchmark where the Model 3 is definitely falling short to the class leaders such as the [C class](http://www.mercedescla.org/forum/attachments/28929d1471300833-cla-interior-vs-c-class-mercedes-c-class-salooon-2014-door-panel-detail-frontseatdriver.co_.uk_.jpg). (Yes, every piece there are real aluminum, including the window switchers, and the speaker grills are laser drilled aluminum as well.)

I personally thought the $5000 price tag for the PUP is quite outrageous for what you get. For that money you'd be buying into [BMW Individual Program interiors] (http://cdn.bmwblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/F80-M3-Individual.jpg). In comparison the full leather interior upgrade of my M3 was a ""mere"" $2k.

On the other hand, build quality was solid and the only rattling I thought I heard turned out to be the zipper of my jacket. Much better ""feel"" than the Model S from the earlier days. Also door pockets and rear cup holders man.

**Technology/User Interface (Exclude Auto Pilot) (2/10):**

This was definitely by far the lowest point of my experience. The car was very bare bone as far as features go, with no heated steering wheel, no HUD, no surround view camera, and one of the worst sound system I've heard from this segment (seriously, mid-high range sound very flat and even distorted at higher volume). 

Then there is the center display, which was responsive and high resolution by itself. But the problem was the interface itself was a complete mess. One cannot even adjust side mirrors without drilling down into the menus while driving. Bringing up the odometer of the car was a puzzle game by itself. The passenger couldn't open the glove compartment when I was trying to setup Bluetooth with my phone. Navigation itself was fine, but the UI was dangerously unsafe since the turn-by-turn instruction was to the far right side of the screen, with small fonts on top of an alpha overlay. Coming from [what I currently have](https://i.imgur.com/vBjVrq8.jpg) it was just infuriating.

And by the way, [this happened twice](https://i.imgur.com/chrYRpQ.jpg) to me on the short drive up to San Francisco. Once it happened when I was trying to get to the menu to adjust my side mirror. Thank Elon for Auto Pilot.

Which brings us to...

**Auto Pilot (10/10):**

The best driver assist in this segment, bar none, end of story. Is it perfect? Not even close. Is it the best money currently can buy? By far. 

I would be lying if I said I didn't miss my M3 on the drive up to San Francisco. But after grabbing a late dinner with friends and I drove back on the boring 101 at night, I would be lying if I said I didn't wish my M3 had Auto Pilot.

**Overall Impression:**

I was impressed by the Model 3. It wasn't perfect, but is definitely without a doubt one of the strongest entries in the crowded luxury sports sedan segment. It does have some unique issues but it also has the unmatched value proposition of the sportiest EV on the market (yes, this car is a lot sportier than a P100D Model S). 

This may very well be my next daily driver, if there is room in the budget for it along with a [718 GTS](http://st.automobilemag.com/uploads/sites/11/2017/12/2018-Porsche-718-Cayman-GTS-front-side-in-motion-01.jpg) :)

The Model 3 is not a true sports car. It is not a real luxury car either. But for 99% of the people out there who can work an EV into their life, it is a *very, very, VERY good* car. The Model 3 is probably not *the* best car in this segment, but I also cannot say any competitor is clearly better. Tesla's first effort in this segment manages to trade blows evenly against the best.

P.S.

The 3 settings for the heated seats seemed to be...

1.	Somewhat warm.

2.	George Foreman.

Brief review after a few days:

‚Äã

Coming from a june 2018 Model 3, the wind noise is almost non-existent. It is so much quieter than my RWD model 3.

The ride is about the same in stiffness. I'm used to it at this point, and it doesn't bother me.

There are no creaks or rattles. It is very quiet to my model 3 rwd ears.

The power on it is crazy. Coming from 4.9s 0-60 to 3.5 is a huge difference in feeling, i love it.

The fit and finish is great. There is one smol cosmetic issue that I don't care to schedule an appointment for to fix.

It is MUCH bigger feeling than the model 3. It feels heavier. There's more body roll in sharp turns (still feels very planted to the road). The doors are way bigger and heavier to open.

So much space with the seats down. I am very happy with how much room I have to transport things.

Lots of other stuff, but this is what was currently on my mind.

TeslaMotors,I want,nzu1zh,I feel like Tesla's communication around the Model S Plaid has been extremely dishonest.,"I feel like Tesla's communication around the Model S plaid has been extremely dishonest and I want to give some examples.

**0-60times LR vs Plaid**

 On tesla.com the 0-60 times are given as 3.1s for the LR and 1.99s for Plaid. *However* when you look at the fine print (and that only shows when clicking on feature details) you see that Tesla has ""With first foot of rollout subtracted"" but *only* for the Plaid making this an apples to oranges comparison.

If you were to also subtract rollout from the LR times the two numbers would actually be much closer, so Tesla is intentionally making the performance gap seem bigger than it is.

**The screen tilt**

Tesla advertises on the Model S pages that the center screen tilts but now it has come to light that this is something that is not available right now and supposedly comes in a software update. You cannot actually move the screen even manually. There was no mention anywhere that this feature will come later. 

And by knowing Tesla's timelines this might as well be 2 years away.

**""The car shifts by itself""**

Elon has tweeted a lot about how the car shifts itself and many news outlets reported on how you don't have to shift manually anymore. Now we know the car can only shift out of park by itself and this is also a **beta** feature, which is arguably one of Tesla's tricks to not have to claim liability.

You still have to shift gears to do 3 way turns or to park, using the onscreen shifter.

**The gaming capabilities**

The product page of the Model S shows the Witcher 3 and the event they demoed Cyberpunk. None of these games are in the car and there is no communication if or when they will be available.

The Product page also shows a game loaded on the rear screen. It is not possible to start games on the rear screen as of now.

**The Plaid+ cancelation**

""Plaid+ was canceled because Plaid is too good"", ""No one needs more than 400 miles"".

Both of these statements are quite dubious and it is clear that Tesla is hiding *something* here, maybe not enough orders or maybe problems with manufacturing the new cells.

I am a Tesla owner and generally very happy and still think that Tesla is the best EV manufacturer but I must say that I become increasingly frustrated with the stuff coming out of Elon's mouth because at this point I just have to stop believing everything he says.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/nzu1zh/i_feel_like_teslas_communication_around_the_model/,xdert,124256.0,-0.6701

TeslaMotors,I want,no7ahx,Another no radar experience from someone who has driven both,"Picked up a no radar Model Y from Princeton yesterday.  Today I decided to travel down to Barnegat to visit family.  Might be a lengthy post, but the following is the experience with a no radar car.

To set the scene a little there was moderate to heavy rain.  It was by no means a downpour,  but closer to that than a drizzle.  Didn't start AP until I went on the parkway since it's only a couple miles away.  Almost immediately after engaging autopilot I got a notification saying something along the lines of autopilot speed reduced due to inclement weather.  I waited a while to see how low it would go, but eventually had to take over after it hit 54 or 55mph-ish.  Traveling 55 on the parkway is just dangerously slow even when it's raining so I had to take over.  I've taken this route many times in similar and even worse weather conditions and never had problems with my old Y.  I figured I would just use cruise control, but I guess I should have known since it only allows TaCC, it had problems with that as well.

So I go another 10 or so miles having to drive manually without even basic cruise control (I know first world problems).   At this point the rain briefly stopped completely, so I tried it again.  It ended up being a double whammy of sorts.  First I got a phantom brake event when I went under a double overpass and immediately after there was a merge.  I wouldn't think it would be from the overpasses since my understanding is radar was rumored to cause that by bouncing up into them and misinterpreting it for a car.  It also unfortunately cannot be explained by the merging cars though or really anything else since they were no where near me and I wasn't even in the right lane.  Shortly after that, while it is still not raining mind you I again got the limited speed warning I'm assuming from the other cars kicking up the rain driving to the side of me.  At this point I just went the rest of the way manually.  Even when driving manually I got an alert stating forward collision warning when I was nowhere near anybody, not once, but twice.  The Tesla went from the best car to drive a long distance on the freeway to a worse experience than my old Honda since at least that could use cruise control.

&#x200B;

On the way back it was even worse though.  It was about 3AM and the auto high beams were flashing on and off at almost every sign.  I assume the reflection of light from the highly reflective signs were confusing it.  I thought no problem, this is why I disabled auto high beams on the old one.  I press forward to turn high beams off.  I immediately get a notice saying they need to be on for autopilot.  It now requires auto high beams to use autopilot.  I turn them back on and just say I'll look like a goof with them constantly turning on and off.  There weren't all that many people out there at this time anyway.  I'm driving along and it was getting closer to another vehicle than I was comfortable with with high beams on.  I also didn't want them to think I was road raging on them since they kept flashing on and off due to the signs.  So again I just decide I'll use cruise control and again I find out I can't even use that without auto high beams.  So yet again I'm manually driving the car having a less pleasant experience than my old Honda.

&#x200B;

Again I came from and still technically have an old Model Y with radar.  The only reason I even ""upgraded"" is I was lucky to have reserved one while it was $49k thinking maybe if a tax incentive passes I could upgrade and end up only paying a little.  When they said they had one ready I checked Vroom and for some reason they offered $51k, so it was kinda a no brainer even if the bill doesn't pass that says any cars after May 24th.

Either way, it was unequivocally a worse experience than my old one, and it wasn't even particularly close.  Still hope much of it can be fixed with updates, but at this point not only is it almost unusable in the rain, it's almost unusable in areas in which it had previously rained and there are other cars near you.  This last point is likely just me being too nervous I'm pissing off other drivers, it may not well of even been bothering anybody, but at least for me, and at least based on this experience, it's not even usable at night... at all.

TL;DR: Based on my admittedly limited experience, and at least for now, the non-radar versions are significantly worse.  In multiple ways, not just weather.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit: Wow, this kinda blew up.  I probably shouldn't have had it email me on posts as it kinda filled my inbox.  Saw some questions, super busy, and there's a reason I'm going back and forth at times like 3AM, but will try to answer a few questions later.

One I just saw asked if I had video of it, which unfortunately I don't as I was alone.  I probably shouldn't have taken them, but I do have a few pictures.  I was trying to get a picture of one of the random ""forward collision warning"" notices on screen, but was unable to get it before it disappeared.  This does show a very rough idea of what the weather was like and as can be seen in the photo at this point it was no longer even giving the option for autopilot as can be seen by no wheel icon.

Edit 2:  Just noticed in the pictures it actually seems to still see things fine based on the visualizations, so maybe there's still hope some/much can be fixed in software?  Perhaps I'm just being to optimistic though.

&#x200B;

TeslaMotors,I want,gzzj5h,I returned my Model Y back to Tesla - Full Story/Details,"I have been hesitant to post my experience on this subreddit, but ultimately decided this information should be shared with the community. I have added some more details from another post to help outline the facts.

As the title states I returned my Model Y PUP back to Tesla Monday. This was mainly due to safety concerns and poor customer service. I will try and keep my recap short, but there are several items to cover...

I took delivery Friday June 5th in Kansas City (Delivery Center that was assigned). On my way home to Oklahoma City, about half way, I heard some noise from under the car. I pulled over to find the front aero piece hanging down and not attached. I see that I am a mile from a Casino parking lot (in the middle of nowhere Kansas) and decide to limp it there to evaluate further. That mile I could hear terrible noises coming from the front, but I didn't want to be on the shoulder of the interstate dealing with this, so I slowly made it to that parking lot. I call Tesla Roadside and am given the option to drive it back to Kansas City for service or have it towed. They tell me that the towing option would be covered only if the issue is deemed to be a warranty item. If they find its a warranty item I can work on being reimbursed. At this point I had the car for 48 hours and driven 250 miles. I had not hit anything or gone over any rough terrain. I felt confident that this would be a warranty issue. So, in order to avoid any further damage to the vehicle, I opted for the tow and thought I would get this worked out at the service center.¬†

I had it towed to the Kansas City service center Sunday night. An interesting point to note is that there was miscommunication with the tow truck company, and the tow truck driver was told that Tesla paid for the tow in full, so I wouldn't have to sign anything or pay. I asked the driver a few times to confirm, and figured maybe if they find that it wasn't a warranty issue they add it to my service invoice (my first Tesla and Service Experience).

The next day (Monday) after finding accommodations in Kansas City for the night, I arrived at the service center in the morning to make sure everything was handled. Explained what happened, they apologize profusely and say they will take a look. After letting them work on it for a few hours, I hear nothing, but since I don‚Äôt live in Kansas City and have nothing to do, I decide to wait at the Tesla center. My advisor comes out and says the car is ready to drive, but since they don‚Äôt have parts they have just secured it to be ‚Äúdriveable.‚Äù No estimates on when they can get parts (I expected that) and we would address it as soon as they are available. He then tells me this absolutely is covered under warranty because the bolts were not secured properly and it wasn‚Äôt done right at the factory. So, I am glad to hear this, but seriously concerned by the oversight. My advisor then tells me I am responsible for the $1,100 tow truck bill. I am initially confused because the car could not be driven without causing more damage. I wasn‚Äôt close to any store where I could buy supplies to tape it up, and I don‚Äôt want to be blamed for more damage. They tell me I can contact Tesla corporate myself and plead my case, but not to expect much. Disappointed about this outcome, I decide to leave the store to try and get some answers from corporate. I spend the next hour trying to get through to a real person which shockingly is more difficult than I thought it would be. I was only able to get a hold of someone by using roadside assistance. I tell the situation to the agent and the agent confirms that ‚Äúif the repair was covered under warranty then the tow should be included in that claim‚Äù. So basically this issue is with the service center and not corporate according to them.

So my 3rd trip to the service center starts with them completely agreeing that this is a warranty repair. I then tell him that Tesla customer service on the phone said that if it‚Äôs a warranty repair then the towing should be covered. He agrees, but says management won‚Äôt budge. I say I will need this to be resolved because this is my 3rd trip here and the tow truck driver is calling my phone for payment. After a long back room discussion they tell me Tesla WILL pay for it, they just don‚Äôt know if the Service Department or Roadside Assistance group will be paying it. I also find out the long delays are because all of this is being done by email... They don't have a number to call someone about it. That seems like an impossible way to get anything done in a timely manner, but that what I was told...

At this point I am upset that this has been so difficult and wasted my entire day, and being an out of town customer looks like it will be a nightmare. I was only able to get this far because I stayed in Kansas City an extra night and took off work. I tell them I am returning the car and want to start that process. I think they were shocked and I was told this was the first time any customer had done this (at their location). I loved the car, I love Tesla and still do. I just can‚Äôt deal with this type of stuff in the future. I can update everyone on the return process as it continues. All they had me do Monday was sign a ‚ÄúReturn Declaration‚Äù and hand them the keys.

Haven't heard a word from anyone else at Tesla since yesterday at the store. I just hoping to get some confirmation that my refund is in process.

TL;DR - I bought a Tesla Model Y 2 days ago. A manufacturing defect caused me to be stuck 2 1/2 hours from home. Tesla covered the repair under warranty but refused to pay the $1,100 tow truck bill. With some of the delivery issues, this warranty repair, and the terrible customer service it made me rethink this purchase and I walked away. Still like Tesla, but will wait until things are more ironed out.

Some Clarifications

\- the ""aero piece"" is different than the Model 3, it is a hard plastic cover. Some have commented that its just a fabric. On my car it would drag and flap wildly hitting underneath anytime I went over 30 MPH.

\- My biggest concern was voiding the warranty. I could Uber 20 miles to get some tape or remove it. However, I was unable to get any confirmation from Tesla that if I proceed with taping/removing it that it wouldn't void my warranty.- I didn't really return it due to the failure, it was more from how difficult it was to get a hold of anyone at Tesla and discuss the issue. Living in a state that does not have any Tesla locations made me realize that if I had a problem it might be a difficult thing to resolve.

\- My comment about loving Tesla comes from all the things they are trying to accomplish. The car had very little issues (no more than any other new car I had purchased). I know there are some that are in terrible shape and there is no excuse for that. The car was great, and amazing to drive. They really just lost me on the on going support.¬†

&#x200B;

Edit: Some have asked for proof -  [https://imgur.com/a/LvHqk82](https://imgur.com/a/LvHqk82) \- This is the return document signed. It is not an early build for anyone tracking the VINs. The door listed a production date of May 2020, post factory shutdown.

Edit 2: A picture of the damage and panel -  [https://imgur.com/a/gLoZkms](https://imgur.com/a/gLoZkms)  \- The wind would catch this panel and it would hit the car and drag on the ground. My understanding is that the Model Y has a slightly different part than the older Model 3's that were using a fabric composite. I was not close to a store to complete my own repair, and no way to get a hold of Tesla and confirm my own temporary repair wouldn't void the warranty. Regardless, I was disappointed this part wasn't secured properly at delivery. I did not hit anything, you can see the front lip and the rest of the underside has not scrapes or damage.

Update 1: Just had a call with a Tesla employee at the Kansas City location. He confirmed that my return is in process and I should expect funds back in 15-20 days.

TeslaMotors,I want,buiwg4,Am I the only one who DOESN‚ÄôT want the minimal interior for the S and X?,"The removal of the gauge cluster screen and flipping the screen to a horizontal position isn‚Äôt the best idea for the S and X. 

If the car gets the minimal interior and the model 3 motors, what else am I paying over $40,000 more for? The two screens provides more information and a better experience. Moving to the minimal causes the S to be like a 3. Same thing with the X. 

Why would I spend much much more money for a fanci-er body and other minor features?

TeslaMotors,I want,e3x4l7,I need an SUV. I want a Model Y but Toyota just announced a RAV4 PHEV that gets 39 all electric miles. Its cheaper than Y...im torn.,"My daily commute to work is approx 31 miles round trip. That's most of my driving. I put about 8k miles on my car each year. I'm currently driving a 2007 Honda civic that's still in good condition engine-wise and about 110k miles. I can probably keep driving it another 5 years. I'm in New York to give you an idea about climate.

The thing is, I've got a toddler and my 2nd baby will be born in a few weeks. My wife hates the idea of getting an all electric vehicle but I've heard the stories about test drives so I'm not concerned with that. I'm concerned with being practical. If that tax credit were still available for the teslas I'd be all over it. 

I can afford a Y LR RWD but... I can also use the ""saved"" money to pay off my house sooner. 

Is there anyone that can offer some advice in this situation?  Should i wait another year for the SR model Y?  Should i just go for the RAV4 Prime PHEV?",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/e3x4l7/i_need_an_suv_i_want_a_model_y_but_toyota_just/,ForTheB0r3d,14063.0,0.7929

I just got back from testing out smart summon and it‚Äôs so insane to see your beautiful Tesla drive itself to you. Sure it‚Äôs not faster than 5MPH but honestly, that seems plenty fast when you‚Äôre not in the driver‚Äôs seat.

The added driving visualizations to the app are clever and smart, adding a sense of reassurance while your Tesla does its thing. It even tells you when it‚Äôs waiting for a pedestrian to finish crossing!

I think the cherry on top, though, is definitely the reactions you get. I had two people ask me as I was driving away if my car was driving itself and they were ecstatic when they heard me say yes. They told me how weird it was to see the car drive to me and then see me hop into the driver‚Äôs seat and drive off.

TeslaMotors,I want,tx2i24,The case for the 600-mile range EV,"Elon has [repeatedly tweeted](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1498981268398161922?lang=en) that 400-miles of range is sufficient. I agree, but disagree that Tesla's cars ""rated"" for 400 miles achieve that goal.


1. The only time most even care about range is highway driving / road trips. Highway driving, at a reasonably slow 70-75 mph, achieves ~80% rated range in a *best case scenario*.
2. If there are *any* aggravating (but expected) factors, such as headwinds, colder weather, higher speed, rain, etc., then that number can fall to 50% rated efficiency.
3. Since supercharging to 100% takes a *long* time, and pulling into the charger below 5% is not likely given their spacing, most people will only SC from ~10%-80%, or approximately 70% of the car's battery capacity.

400 miles range X 80%/50% efficiency X 70% charge level = **160-225 miles of range.**

True 400 miles highway range would require at least a 600-mile range rated battery. 

I know that we won't see this for the foreseeable future given the battery supply constraints (why sell one car with 600 miles range when you can sell two with 300).

Just my $0.02 on the issue. I think that *a lot* of people won't switch to EVs until they have that kind of range. Will they need it 90% of the time? No, but they'll want it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/tx2i24/the_case_for_the_600mile_range_ev/,colinstalter,231879.0,0.9614
TeslaMotors,I want,y3bg89,"As a non-Tesla EV owner, I now get it!","I get it.  I now understand why so many people are emphatically over the moon with their Tesla. I myself drive an Audi e-tron and my wife drives a Volvo XC60 PHEV, but over the past week we drove a Model Y Long Range over 850 miles while on vacation. We drove it in downtown urban areas, suburbs, on the interstate, on back country roads, a National Park, and even an international border. After driving the car for a week in many different types of driving scenarios, I can confidently say driving a Tesla is the most complete EV experience currently on the market. The key word here is EV, as the majority of my dislikes stem around the car part of the Y we rented. The EV/Software part of the Y was nearly a full chef's kiss. The only thing that really left a bad taste in my mouth was a few aspects of the auto-pilot (AP) system.

Things I loved:

* Plug and charge
* In car route planning with charging
* Showing how many spots were open at a Super Charger
* One pedal driving
* Amazing efficiency
* AP can find and maintain a lane like no other system I've used

Things that were neat:

* The slight delay before regen kicked in when coming off AP, giving you enough time to get your foot on the accelerator.
* The speed limit recognition system automatically converting KPH to MPH when driving into Canada.
* The charge door opening when pressing the button on the charger handle
* Being able to watch a Hulu show while waiting to board a car ferry.

Things I didn't really care for but wasn't a big deal

* The two step door handles were a little annoying
* The driving info on the left side of the screen was a little gimmicky. I would have preferred to have a full screen map then an animation of a semi-truck that was actually a car pulling a trailer.
* The vegan leather looked and felt cheap but the seats were ultimately comfortable to sit in for hours which is really what is important.
* No real-time visualization of traffic along the route. I'm fairly certain traffic was taken into account when route planning, but there is no indication I could find to show it on the map. Ultimately not a big deal since it really did seem like traffic was taken into account when creating a route.

Things I really didn't like

* The suspension is subpar. The Y really needs better suspension and maybe even an air suspension system. Once the roads start to get a little rough, the suspension really started to show its faults. It was fine on smooth roads though.
* Road noise is a problem. It gets loud in the cabin over 60 mph, especially if the road is not perfectly smooth.
* There were various squeaks and creaks when going over bumps and on rough roads.
* Looking at the map while driving was a bit of a neck stretch. Like I said before, it would have been nice to have a full screen map or at least have it positioned closer to the driver.
* There is no cruise control speed memory past being able to automatically set it at the speed limit (or X% past the speed limit)
* The torque sensor for AP is not very sensitive. Our Audi is capacitive but the Volvo uses a torque sensor and only takes the slightly nudge to recognize an input. I could wiggle the Y's steering wheel and nothing. I ended up just flicking the volume up and down in these cases which was a little annoying.

Things that drove me bonkers

* Adaptive cruise control is way too sensitive. I only had one phantom braking instance but there were many times I would pass a parked car, a cyclist, a runner, a car turning left in front of me, and a few other things that would trigger a panic brake scenario. Our Audi and Volvo do not have this problem.
* No blind spot monitoring system. I found Tesla's solution to blind spots more effort and increased the amount of time when my eyes were off the road. Almost every other manufacturer has a light on the mirror which lets you quickly look in your mirror and see if someone is in your blind spot simultaneously. It's a two step process in a Tesla and I found myself manually checking my blind spots in heavy traffic situations.
* AP disabling every single time I changed lanes. In moderate traffic, this became a nuisance every time I moved into the left lane to pass someone.
* Auto high beams when AP was enabled. I ended up blinding a bunch of people because this system is not up to snuff. Our Audi and Volvo do not have this problem. I eventually just turned AP off after getting flashed multiple times by oncoming cars.
* AP is an all or nothing system. It's great at maintaining your lane, but in the rare instance it didn't,  I wish the system would let you make a small correction instead of disabling altogether. It was very jerky and would fight me in those situations. It just didn't feel safe.

I do want to touch on AP one more time as I was blown away by how well it would maintain a lane. It didn't matter if it was a construction zone with a temporary lane made of cones or a twisty mountain road full of switch backs. The darn car would stay in the center of the lane and handle almost any turn no matter how tight. It truly is next level in this aspect. The big problem I had with AP was the ancillary systems around it that made the experience like monitoring a toddler. Frankly, AP is much more advanced than Audi or Volvo's system but the latter systems are so much more relaxing to use, especially on the interstate where lane markings are generally good.

Alright. If you have read this far you're probably thinking I hate the vehicle after how much complaining I did but that truly isn't the case. The things that made the Y great were weighted much higher than what wasn't so great. Point being, the EV/Software aspects of the car are so polished that I get how people are willing to overlook some of the things Tesla doesn't do well with. Would I buy one? IDK. Maybe. It's hard to say since we already have two nice cars, but at the very least I get what the hype is about. I'm also having a hard time adjusting to not having one pedal driving on my e-tron after spending a week with the Tesla so there is that. :)

TeslaMotors,I want,oetbed,Tesla should transition to subscription only FSD and allow early backers a transferable license.,"With the evolution of FSD it seems that things are getting ironed out with the potential future business plan of FSD. It seems Tesla will want to focus primarily on the subscription model. This makes sense as the percentage of FSD package buyers must be minimal in comparison to potential customers willing to jump into a subscription model of FSD.

In my opinion going forward Tesla will probably want to eliminate the ability to buy FSD. I know they said otherwise but that is meaningless. Can you buy a lifetime subscription to netflix/phone/cable etc? The two options typically dont intertwine.

Tesla should ""reward"" the adoptors. The people who believed and funded FSD without anything to show for their huge investment. Rewards us with a licence. Something that is transferable to any vehicle we own. This will not only keep us essentially locked into the Tesla brand here on out, but would also show the least amount of good will all things considering.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/oetbed/tesla_should_transition_to_subscription_only_fsd/,Split_Seconds,38599.0,0.9337
TeslaMotors,I want,df13ul,To Raven or Not to Raven?,"Alright I'm trusting you Redditors with this one!

As you may or may not know, I became a first time Tesla owner in 2016, almost exactly 3 years ago today. The test drive instantly hooked me. [Apollo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ICgMYIzhxg) was a 3 year lease.

Before I took the dive, I'd been waiting patiently. With any piece of tech, there are good and bad times to buy. So when Tesla unveiled the P100D update and new front fascia, I knew it was perfect. A brand new car with the latest and greatest of what Tesla had to offer. Perfect time to buy. Or at least I thought.

2 weeks later, Tesla pulled ANOTHER major update to autopilot 2.0 hardware with extra cameras, etc. Older cars could not be retrofitted. So instantly Apollo feels slightly outdated. I still love her, but I felt slightly jipped. And I definitely want to avoid that feeling again.

So here we are in 2019 at the end of the line with Apollo. She's aging and doesn't get all the V10 features. I actually have a 6 month bonus month-to-month lease extension until March 2020 to make my choice and give Apollo back. I know I want to keep driving Model S... Do I just upgrade to the Raven Model S now and assume Plaid Model S is the next refresh? Or are the chances high of a refresh coming in the next few months that will make new Raven owners feel ripped off again? Interior refresh? Battery update?

Any other thoughts I'm missing? I've been pondering this for months.

EDIT: Lots of great advice, ya'll. Thank you. Ordered Raven Performance now. Will trade in if by some miracle there's a refresh between now and Plaid.

TeslaMotors,I want,h8uq22,Refused delivery of my Model Y,"Yesterday was the day that I was finally going to take delivery of a Model Y (LR/AWD/Induction/Blue/Black). I live in Seattle, WA and we (my wife and two kids) drove down to the Renton Service Center for delivery.

I was armed with delivery checklist and was mentally prepared to walk away from the car if it seemed like it had too many issues. Well, I won't bury the lede: it had way too many issues. The highlights:

-	Almost a dozen small paint issues/scratches all over the car (front and back).
-	A few large scratches on the rear bumper area.
-	Several panel gaps that were either too wide or too narrow (flush with another panel or trim).
-	Condensation in one of the fog lights.
-	Door trim that was oddly faded and not matching the blackness of the rest of the trim.
-	Rear tail lights totally mis-mounted and sticking out / mis-aligned.

It‚Äôs pretty clear that little to no quality control or inspection went into this vehicle (vin # 011xxx) before it was presented to me for delivery.

The delivery specialist I spoke to was pretty clear: if I accepted delivery, it would be my car and I‚Äôd have to hope for the best in terms of getting these issues fixed. He also reminded me that if I returned the car under their 7-day return policy, I would be prohibited by buying another Model Y for 1 year.

He suggested that I give them a chance to correct the issues. He seemed confident that his delivery team could correct the paint/cosmetic issues, but he said he‚Äôd have to check with Service on the issues regarding panel gaps, tail light mounting, etc.

So, we drove home without the Tesla Model Y. I apologized to my wife and promised my kids a treat on the way home. I‚Äôm expecting to hear from Tesla about a re-scheduled delivery, so fingers crossed that they can correct these issues!

On question and one bit of strong advice:

Advice: whether you take delivery OR NOT, please take tons of pictures and video. I didn‚Äôt do that, and I really wish I had so that I could share them with you all now and get your thoughts on whether these were issues or not.

Question: Does anyone know of any good, clear photos of what ‚Äúspec‚Äù panel gaps and alignment should be? I would have killed to have been able to reference this during my delivery.

Thanks!

Relevant section:

‚ÄúIf you decide to order another vehicle, you may not order the same trim for a period of 12 months but may order another vehicle in a different trim at any time.‚Äù 

**UPDATE #3:**

Just wanted to let you all know that I emailed the Tesla advisor that initially had emailed me about my Model Y back in April. I‚Äôm not really sure if this person is ‚Äúassigned‚Äù to me, and other people had called me about preparing for yesterday‚Äôs delivery. I don‚Äôt know if Tesla has ‚Äúdelivery specialists‚Äù anymore or what their process is, but this was the only person I could think to email.

Anyway, I asked for a new VIN. After sleeping on it and looking at pictures/videos of other Model Y‚Äôs, I just didn‚Äôt feel good about this car. Even if they could correct all these issues I could see, what about the issues I can‚Äôt see?

I had to cancel the auto insurance I had preemptively purchased (whoops) and I‚Äôm wondering if Tesla is going to start billing me for loan payments on a car that I haven‚Äôt received yet. They already have my loan deposit and signed loaned paperwork.

TeslaMotors,I want,7tihsr,I‚Äôve wanted a Tesla for 12 years - today I bought one! (2014 MSP85D),"I remember reading about the Roadster when I was in high school, and ever since then, I‚Äôve wanted a Tesla. I don‚Äôt particularly care about cars, which is why I have only owned/had one for two out of the 12 years since I became eligible to drive. However, I have always been a fan of the future, and it has been obvious to me from the first time I read about Tesla that electric vehicles will dominate the 21st century. My primary mode of transportation for the last year has been a Boosted electric skateboard (which I rode to meet the seller of my Tesla today - he said the sale was contingent on getting to ride the skateboard).

So, when it came time for our growing family to move to the suburbs and get a car, I knew what I had to get. I found a good deal on a worn-in (75K miles) but well taken care of P85D, fully loaded, and sold by the original owner.

I am going to take this thing to 350,000 miles. I will drive it until the wheels fall off, and then I will replace the wheels.

TeslaMotors,I want,ro2y36,I think the holiday update is a step backwards in design and functionality. Do you agree?,"I just got the Holiday update with FSD Beta, and in the span of a few minutes, I gathered the following reasons why I don't like the UI at all. I not only think it looks like a rushed design overhaul with mismatched color schemes, icon designs, and inconsistencies, this update actually has taken away a lot of conveniently located items and buried them in menus, thereby sacrificing functionality and efficiency.

I have enumerated my reasons here and the link below references images.

[https://imgur.com/a/u8CPftc](https://imgur.com/a/u8CPftc)

1. The icons are childish and unpolished. Someone else had said the icons look like they were designed by a 3rd year old. I agree. The colors remind me of off-brand phone OS, and there is inconsistencies in icon design. In the old build, the icon bar at the bottom nicely blended with the rest of the UI and the icons weren't vibrantly blinding you with colors. They were quietly sitting there blending with the rest of the UI! I really don't like this, as you might be able to tell from the emotions, haha! 
2. The speedometer is terribly small and horribly positioned in the leftmost corner. In certain driving positions, your right hand can block the view of it. What was wrong with it large, bolded, and centered?
3. Checking trip information was easy and one slide away. Why is it now buried in the menus?
4. Same as in 3. but for tire pressure.
5. When you pull up from the bottom of the screen, no matter where you begin from, the HVAC controls come up. This seems like a waste of gestures in functionality. For example, it was nice that in the previous builds, we could get different music player UIs by sliding up and down on the icon.
6. The full-screen FSD Beta visualization is *nice*, but it should not have replaced the semi full-screen view. I loved the 2/3 1/3 split between Beta and maps because it gave me the best view of what Beta was seeing and about to do and what the next maneuver was based on map data. I don't really see the point of this full-screen view. I don't trust Beta enough to let it go without me seeing the map in full detail. The little window in the left bottom corner only tells you your next move, so it's not as detailed as a full map with your position on it.
7. This one kills me. Why did they remove frequently used items from the top of the screen like Dashcam and move it to the Controls menu? Imagine while driving you want to suddenly record a clip. Instead of the conveniently located icon which was one tap away, you have to go through two taps and find a location on the screen while focused on driving.Also, from a design perspective, why would you mix functionalities that can potentially be used on every drive--dashcam, wiper settings--with rare features like screen brightness and mirrors and steering setting?

All in all, it looks like this update was rushed and little thought went into the design elements and the trade-off between decluttering and losing functionality. This isn't meant to blame the engineers as I'm sure they're all overclocked at work, but rather I want to see what other people think. I *personally* really don't like this update as I think it's a step backwards for the most part, and I hope we see a UI change in the near future.

TeslaMotors,I want,c9fpgv,How the Tesla Model 3 has Ruined Me,"&#x200B;

[Supercharging on the Way Home](https://preview.redd.it/uy11zpftgh831.jpg?width=4160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3947e75dfd6c0767121845235a5973ed8e72ea2e)

In November last year I took delivery of my black, rear wheel drive, long range Tesla Model 3. I‚Äôd never driven in a Tesla before, much less driven one myself. Still, the lure of a 300+ mile range fully electric vehicle and the soon to be cut in half Federal tax credit swayed me and my wife to take the plunge. Six or so months and 11,000 miles later, the car has more or less ruined me on driving any other vehicle. The Model 3 does things that feel groundbreaking and paradigm shifting, and, even more amazingly, in a, ‚ÄúWhy hasn‚Äôt it always been this way,‚Äù sort of way.

1. Entry, exit, and control of the vehicle through the app is pretty much flawless (note: with a modern phone) and doesn't require a dedicated device. Walking up to the car with your enabled smartphone means getting in is as simple as pulling on the handle. Other cars have similar behaviors with key fobs, but who wants to carry anything else around when I already have a computer with all sorts of connectivity options sitting in my pocket? This is what Tesla has done; eliminated something I used to have to carry around. The funny thing is I never really thought much about carrying keys around until I didn‚Äôt have to do so anymore. Now that I don‚Äôt have to carry keys, when I drive my wife‚Äôs car I‚Äôm very aware that I have this other device in my pocket.
2. The acceleration is effortless, silent, and addicting. Seriously addicting. I came to the Tesla from an economy sedan, so the difference for me is greater than someone who may have had another performance luxury vehicle, but oh my God is the acceleration just lovely. Even better, it‚Äôs all so effortless. When I get in another vehicle now and put the pedal down it feels like everything is just working so hard to achieve what the Tesla does instantaneously and with almost no noise (just an appealing motor whine that reminds me of the Tumbler in stealth mode in the Nolan lead Batman series). When someone in a traditionally powered vehicle drives past with their engine roaring, it feels like such an anachronism now.
3. The entire braking system does things the right way. The magnetic braking means I typically only have to use my physical brakes at somewhere between 4 and 6 MPH to come to a complete stop, instead of braking the vehicle all the way down from 60 or 65 MPH, which will clearly create far more wear on the braking system. The magnetic braking was the thing I was most nervous about initially, having read stories of people coming to jerky stops when getting used to it. Those fears were entirely unfounded. Except for my first toll booth stop (which was hilariously about 15 feet too soon), I‚Äôve found it entirely intuitive and easy to get used to. Now, when I drive a different car and take my foot off the accelerator I‚Äôm cranky about the fact that I have to push the stupid brake pedal down (what is this, the 50s?) to really slow the car, instead of the car just doing it automatically.
4. Speaking of annoying things you just do in your car without thinking about it, how about turning the car on and off? The Tesla system to turn the car on (you really don't, but you get it ready to go by pushing the brake pedal with your phone in your pocket) and turn it off (you really don‚Äôt, just open the door) doesn‚Äôt need to be a Tesla only thing. Any car with a key fob could do both of these things, really. Why do they require me to push a different button? Speaking of that, the fact that the Tesla automatically locks the doors when you get out of range takes a little getting used to (there‚Äôs initially a fear it won‚Äôt work) but once you do it‚Äôs another one of those little things that all cars should just do, but for some reason don‚Äôt. Note, however, that getting used to this stuff means you‚Äôll probably leave your other cars running accidentally. My wife has caught me just hopping out of our other car a few times without shutting it off. Sorry, I thought this was 2019.
5. The minimal gauges was something I loved from the moment I sat in the car for the first time. It took about 10 minutes to get used to looking slightly right instead of slightly down for my speed, and (admittedly) about a week to get used to the lane obstacle detection in the same location, but it‚Äôs all so clean and tidy. The internal navigation is fantastic (and the 3D perspective it gives is a nice touch), and the infotainment system works well (generally). I was initially worried I‚Äôd hate not having SiriusXM (and honestly, I still think for this level of car it should be an option), but I ended up cancelling my app-based Sirius subscription about 2 months after getting the car because there are a ton of options built in for free. Getting into a more typical car now feels like information overload, with dozens of dials, gauges, and buttons competing for my attention, and LED light coming from every direction. Driving the Model 3, in particular at night, feels far more connected with the outside world because of the minimal distractions within the cabin.
6. What does gas cost right now? I honestly don‚Äôt know, but up until November I‚Äôd always had a sense of what it cost per gallon, because I was filling up every 6 days. Even better, my wife barely has to fill up more than once a month because on the weekends we pile all five of us into my car for basically every drive (us plus our three daughters). Our other vehicle (a Pacifica) is relegated to times where we both need to go somewhere or we‚Äôre driving a long enough distance that having three kids in the back is going to lead to arguments. Otherwise, even though the kids clearly have significantly more space in the minivan, they always want to drive in the Tesla. This gets me to another reason this car has ruined me on other cars. Sure, I need to charge, but I just plug in when I get home, and I head in to the house. No more freezing while pumping gas in the middle of February. Sure, I lost approximately 25% range in the Winter months due to the cold, but that‚Äôs not much of a problem when you can ‚Äúfill up‚Äù every night (scheduled to use off-peak electric prices) if you‚Äôre worried about your range, and the car is filling up while I‚Äôm reading, hanging out with the wife and kids, or sleeping.
7. How about service? I had a minor squeaking coming from the back wheels when reversing (common problem) and my horn would only sound when I pushed the right hand side (again, common). I scheduled service within the app for the nearest location, and then Tesla sent a message a few days later saying that these issues could be addressed by their mobile service system, so they drove to my house and did everything in my driveway. I didn‚Äôt need to go to some shop, sit in their waiting room for who knows how long, try to work using their wifi, etc. I just hung out at my house, doing what I usually would, and they fixed the two issues. Awesome.
8. Software updates are flawless and fast. You get notified on your phone that an update is available, click to start the update process, and then a little later get notified that the update is complete. By comparison, software updates in our Pacifica created a situation where climate control was broken for a month while they figured out what went wrong, and updating my old car required me to download images to a flash drive and sit with the car running for an hour while the update was applied. Updates are also super frequent and not insignificant in what they‚Äôre doing, including things like adding 5% more range to the car and better power (as if that was really necessary).

To be objective, however, there are some annoyances:

1. Voice control is still pretty limited. My 2012 Ford had better voice control options (voice and phrase detection was far worse in that car, which is pretty much flawless in the Tesla, but there were more phrases it would recognize), including some that I think are absolutely necessary, like, ‚ÄúCall Sarah on mobile.‚Äù Right now in the Tesla I can only say, ‚ÄúCall Sarah,‚Äù and it lists all the numbers I have for her in my contacts, which requires me to scroll to find the right one and tap on it on the display.
2. Speaking of phone control, the pick up / hang up options should be able to be ‚Äútapped‚Äù through the steering wheel buttons.
3. Cell connectivity sometimes just flakes out for the in-car infotainment. I park underground at work, so the car won‚Äôt have LTE coverage in the garage, but it also seems to just lose the ability to reconnect when I come back up above ground (probably weekly). A couple of times a month it seems to require a soft reboot to get it to reconnect to LTE.
4. The piano black plastic covers for the center console area are scratch and dust magnets. I tried to wrap them but messed it up the first time so I haven‚Äôt tried again. Still, for an expensive car I‚Äôd think they‚Äôd have a nicer setup in such a prominent area. It‚Äôs pretty clear this is a common complaint when center console wraps are such a common purchase for Model 3 owners.

Two other points worth mentioning quickly:

1. This car is more contagious than a yawn at the DMV. A friend and my parents both bought Model 3s after driving in mine basically once. It‚Äôs that nice. It‚Äôs that different.
2. I recently got back from a 3.5 hour drive in our other car (family vacation), and I immediately volunteered to go get groceries, just so I could drive the Tesla. Usually the last thing I‚Äôd want to do is drive more after a long drive. Instead, it just highlighted the advantages of the Tesla.

So, that‚Äôs it at a high level. The Model 3 has ruined me on other cars, and it has done so by concentrating on the everyday aspects of car driving. In the Kano model, it has basically added delighters and performance features that everyone else is just checking the box on. It takes a lot of things we just take for granted as ‚Äúthe way it‚Äôs done,‚Äù and reimagined them in a way that feels like it‚Äôs redefining what driving should be in the 21st century.

TeslaMotors,I want,5368xr,"As a big car enthusiast (yes, including ICEs), I just want to really thank Elon for cutting out dealerships.","Before Tesla came along nobody thought it was possible. People always thought the whole dealership experience is like paying tax, unpleasant and unavoidable. I have dealt with many dealerships throughout my life, from Honda to Ferrari, from [quite pleasant experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/41r578/soi_drove_the_new_mclaren_570s/) to [absolute shit show](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/2z3814/how_did_people_buy_the_new_corvette/), but I've always had consistently good experience at Tesla showrooms.

Sometimes I  have relatives or friends visiting from out of town who are into cars, I usually do two things:
 
Take them in my M3 and tear apart [Skyline Blvd](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/San_Francisco_Bay_Area_Skyline_Blvd.jpg). Sometimes doesn't work out because traffic is bad.

Take them to the nearby Tesla showroom and let them experience the Ludicrous Mode. Never had a problem with this.

We take for granted that Tesla allows almost anyone to test drive a $130k vehicle, and very often not much pressure to sell either. The only other brand who's nearly this chill about test driving is Porsche. I really hope this model becomes more and more mainstream, the difference between the two is almost like the difference between the Apple Genius Bar and Geek Squad.

This direct sales model is in my opinion one of the biggest innovation of Tesla aside from the actual cars.

1. AC/heater indicators on the front page of the UI. You could change the fan icon to the same blue/red that is shown on the dash vent control panel. *Saves the driver from constantly tapping into the control panel to see whether it is cooling or heating*

2. Eco mode. Limit the fan speed to 8 or 9, increase the temperature delta before AC/heat kick on, and reduce power to the heater (and AC if possible). *Balances comfort and efficiency, reduces the desire to fine-tune temperature settings on the fly*

3. Min/max temperature setting. Instead of a single-point temperature target, use the modern thermostat style of having a heat target and a cool target. Anything in between gets fan only at an appropriate speed. *Removes the need to adjust temperature settings at all.

TeslaMotors,I want,6ynd43,I will always want to be able to own and drive my own car. How about you?,"I personally think this idea that no one is going to want to own a car anymore is overblown. I personally love driving, just not in heavy traffic.

I love my car and I don't expect to ever stop owning my own car. I will not however, buy a car that is built on the assumption that I don't ever want to drive it.

The one gripe I have with Elon's implied vision (based on some statements that were made to explain lack of certain driving features in the model 3 - ie - this isn't needed because the car is going to be self-driving) is a design direction that assumes/implies that shortly no one will ever WANT to drive the car. Elon would be correct, if he thinks people like me don't want to own that kind of car (this is not the model 3 but a next-gen vehicle, built to never be driven or hardly at all), but that doesn't mean we don't want to own a car at all...

I don't want to be an eternal passenger, I want a driver's car, but one that also takes away the hateful drudgery of rush hour driving and gives me convenience like summoning, when I want it, and the rest of the time, lets me take the wheel and have fun with MY car.

And by the way, I don't care if the economics say it is cheaper to not own a car and have it always drive itself. That's simply not the experience I want, so the economics of that world are immaterial to me. I don't care if it's free.

TeslaMotors,I want,qrollg,I‚Äôm Leaving FSD Beta,"## TLDR
There are too many issues with the basics that FSD Beta should be called Alpha *(imho)* and because I share this vehicle with my wife, I‚Äôll be requesting to leave the beta.

## Longer version:

First I‚Äôll say that I‚Äôm a huge fan of Tesla and have owned 2016 Model X P90D and currently own 2021 Model Y LR and some stock.  Overall, my wife and I have been overly satisfied with our purchases and investment with Tesla.

*Now the critical part*

**Primary issue** -> all the phantom braking.

While I understand that it‚Äôs a beta, this is just unnerving and scary. 

Generally though, I would not be as concerned if my wife was able to turn FSD beta off for her profile and the issues would go away.  However, that is not how it works. Even just basic TACC does the phantom braking (with FSD option completely disabled in the menu).

*Potential solution* ship beta along side the standard autopilot suite, so owners can fallback to a known good product when they want to give their white knuckles a break.

**Other issues** -> 
  * high beams - constantly flashing oncoming traffic at night (they are objectively subpar, and at worst dangerous to oncoming vehicles) and the part that I cannot agree with is that it‚Äôs enabled by default.  There are other issues associated like returning you to your state before you enabled FSD. I.e. high beams manually turned on, enable FSD, turn off high beams, disable FSD, high beams turn on automatically.
  * I can no longer manage speed in FSD beta (particularly deceleration when entering a slower speed limit zone) because although the scroll wheel does change my desired speed, the vehicle does not slow down within a reasonable distance.  For instance, speed limit goes from 55 to 45.  I preemptively scroll the wheel well before the sign. However the vehicle continues at 55, maybe 54 with no feedback that indicates it‚Äôs actually respecting my set speed limit.  This is bad for 2 reasons, first speeding tickets, and second, have to hit the brakes and then re-engage FSD beta.

There are smaller issues that many have already reported about and I can forgive many of those since this is a beta.  In general my forgiveness is rather high as I myself am in the software industry.  However, these items I‚Äôve highlighted above just make FSD too much work for me and add too much stress to my life and my wife‚Äôs.

Thanks for reading this far, you‚Äôre my hero!

TeslaMotors,I want,7asdkg,Tesla ruined my Mercedes,"I have been driving my Model S every day for about a month.  My other car is a fully loaded Mercedes E class.  Before buying the Tesla the Mercedes was by far the best car I ever owned.  I decided against trading it in for the Tesla because I loved it so much...  This past week circumstances arose such that I had to spend over four hours driving my Mercedes.  The ride felt like complete crap.  I felt like I had to mash the throttle to accelerate, the tiny navigation screen is a joke, I had to remember to turn off the car and lock the doors, no auto pilot.  I never want to drive that two year old $60K car again. Tesla turned my perception of my awesome Mercedes to a piece of shit Ford Pinto in one month.

TeslaMotors,I want,acjdrt,Tesla Autopilot HW3 details,"For the past few months Tesla has been slowly sharing details of its upcoming ‚ÄúHardware 3‚Äù (HW3) changes soon to be introduced into its S/X/3 lineup.  Tesla has stated that cars will begin to be built with the new computer sometime in the first half of 2019, and they have said that this is a simple computer upgrade, with all vehicle sensors (radar, ultrasonics, cameras) staying the same.

Today we have some information about what HW3 actually will (and won‚Äôt) be:

What do we know about the Tesla‚Äôs upcoming HW3?  We actually know quite a bit now thanks to Tesla‚Äôs latest firmware. The codename of the new HW3 computer is ‚ÄúTURBO‚Äù.

Hardware:

We believe the new hardware is based on Samsung Exynos 7xxx SoC, based on the existence of ARM A72 cores (this would not be a super new SoC, as the Exynos SoC is about an Oct 2015 vintage).  HW3 CPU cores are clocked at 1.6GHz, with a MALI GPU at 250MHz and memory speed 533MHz.

HW3 architecture is similar to HW2.5 in that there are two separate compute nodes (called ‚Äúsides‚Äù): the ‚ÄúA‚Äù side that does all the work and the ‚ÄúB‚Äù side that currently does not do anything.

Also, it appears there are some devices attached to this SoC. Obviously, there is some emmc storage, but more importantly there‚Äôs a Tesla PCI-Ex device named ‚ÄúTRIP‚Äù that works as the NN accelerator. The name might be an acronym for ‚ÄúTensor <something> Inference Processor‚Äù.  In fact, there are at least two such ‚ÄúTRIP‚Äù devices, and maybe possibly two per ‚Äúside‚Äù.

As of mid-December, this early firmware‚Äôs state of things were in relative early bring-up. No actual autopilot functionality appears included yet, with most of the code just copied over from existing HW2.5 infrastructure.  So far all the cameras seem to be the same.

It is running Linux kernel 4.14 outside of the usual BuildRoot 2 environment.

In reviewing the firmware, we find descriptions of quite a few HW3 board revisions already (8 of them actually) and hardware for model 3 and S/X are separate versions too (understandably).

The ‚ÄúTRIP‚Äù device obviously is the most interesting one. A special firmware that encompasses binary NN (neural net) data is loaded there and then eventually queried by the car vision code. The device runs at 400MHz. Both ‚ÄúTRIP‚Äù devices currently load the same NNs, but possibly only a subset is executed on each?

With the Exynos SoC being a 2015 vintage and in consideration of comments made by Peter Bannon on the Q2 2018 earnings call, (he said ‚Äúthree years ago when I joined Tesla we did a survey of all of the solutions‚Äù = 2nd half of 2015), does this look like the current HW2/HW2.5 NVIDIA autopilot units were always viewed as a stop-gap and hence the lack of perceived computation power everybody was accusing Tesla of at the time of AP2 release was not viewed as important by Tesla?

SOFTWARE:

In reviewing the binaries in this new firmware, u/DamianXVI was able to work out a pretty good idea of what the ‚ÄúTRIP‚Äù coprocessor does on HW3 (he has an outstanding ability to look at and interpret binary data!):

The ‚ÄúTRIP‚Äù software seems to be a straight list of instructions aligned to 32 bytes (256 bits).  Programs operate on two types of memory, one for input/output and one for working memory.  The former is likely system DRAM and the latter internal SRAM.
Memory operations include data loading, weight loading, and writing output.  Program operations are pipelined with data loads and computations interleaved and weight fetching happening well upstream from the instructions that actually use those weights.  Weights seem to be compressed from the observation that they get copied to an internal region that is substantially larger than the source region with decompression/unpacking happening as part of the weight loading operation.  Intermediate results are kept in working memory with only final results being output to shared memory. 

Weights are loaded from shared memory into working memory and maintained in a reserved slot which is referenced by number in processing instructions.  Individual processing instructions reference input, output, and weights in working memory.  Some processing instructions do not reference weights and these seem to be pooling operations.

u/DamianXVI created graphical visualizations of this data flow for some of the networks observed in the binaries. This is not a visualization of the network architecture, it is a visualization of instructions and their data dependencies.  In these visualizations, green boxes are data load/store. White boxes is weights load. Blue are computation instructions with weights, red and orange are computation blocks without weights.  Black links show output / input overlapping between associated processing operations. Blue links connect associated weight data. These visualizations are representative of a rough and cursory understanding of the data flow.  Obviously, it is likely many links are missing and some might be wrong.  Regardless, you can see the complexity being introduced with these networks.

What is very interesting is that u/DamianXVI concluded that these visualizations look like GoogleNet. At the outset, he did not work with the intention to see if Tesla‚Äôs architecture was similar to GoogleNet; he hadn‚Äôt even seen GoogleNet before, but as he assembled the visualization the similarities appeared.

Diagrams: https://imgur.com/a/nAAhnyW

After understanding the new hardware and NN architecture a bit, we then asked u/jimmy_d to comment and here‚Äôs what he has to say:

‚ÄúDamian‚Äôs analysis describes exactly what you‚Äôd want in an NN processor.  A small number of operations that distill the essence of processing a neural network: load input from shared memory/ load weights from shared memory / process a layer and save results to on-chip memory / process the next layer ‚Ä¶ / write the output to shared memory.  It does the maximum amount of work in hardware but leaves enough flexibility to efficiently execute any kind of neural network.

And thanks Damian‚Äôs heroic file format analysis I was able to take a look at some neural network dataflow diagrams and make some estimates of what the associate HW3 networks are doing.  Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt find anything to get excited about.  The networks I looked at are probably a HW3 compatible port of the networks that are currently running on HW2.

What I see is a set of networks that are somewhat refined compared to earlier versions, but basically the same inputs and outputs and small enough that they can run on the GPU in HW2.  So still no further sightings of ‚ÄúAKNET_V9‚Äù: the unified, multi frame, camera agnostic architecture that I got a glimpse of last year.  Karpathy mentioned on the previous earnings call that Tesla already had bigger networks with better performance that require HW3 to run.  What I‚Äôve seen so far in this new HW3 firmware is not those networks.

What we know about the HW3 NN processor right now is pretty limited.  Apparently there are two ‚ÄúTRIP‚Äù units which seem to be organized as big matrix multipliers with integrated accumulators, nonlinear operators, and substantial integrated memory for storing layer activations.  Additionally it looks like weight decompression is implemented in hardware.  This is what I get from looking at the primitives in the dataflow and considering what it would take to implement them in hardware.  Two big unknowns at the moment are the matrix multiplier size and the onboard memory size.  That, plus the DRAM I/O bus width, would let us estimate the performance envelope.  We can do a rough estimate as follows:

Damian‚Äôs analysis shows a preference for 256 byte block sizes in the load/store instructions.  If the matrix multiplier input bus is that width then it suggests that the multiplier is 256xN in size.  There are certain architectural advantages to being approximately square, so let‚Äôs assume 256x256 for the multiplier size and that it operates at one operation per clock at @verygreen‚Äôs identified clock rate of 400MHz.  That gives us 26TMACs per second, which is 52Tops per second (a MAC is one multiply and one add which equals two operations).  So one TRIP would give us 52Tops and two of them would give us 104Tops.  This is assuming perfect utilization.  Actual utilization is unlikely to be higher than 95% and probably closer to 75%.  Still, it‚Äôs a formidable amount of processing for neural network applications.  Lets go with 75% utilization, which gives us 40Tops per TRIP or 80Tops total.

As a point of reference - Google‚Äôs TPU V1, which is the one that Google uses to actually *run* neural networks (the other versions are optimized for training) is very similar to the specs I‚Äôve outlined above.  From Google‚Äôs published data on that part we can tell that the estimates above are reasonable - probably even conservative.  Google‚Äôs part is 700MHz and benchmarks at 92Tops peak in actual use processing convolutional neural networks.  That is the same kind of neural network used by Tesla in autopilot.  One likely difference is going to be onboard memory - Google‚Äôs TPU has 27MB but Tesla would likely want a lot more than that because they want to run much heavier layers than the ones that the TPU was optimized for.  I‚Äôd guess they need at least 75MB to run AKNET_V9.  All my estimates assume they have budgeted enough onboard SRAM to avoid having to dump intermediate results back to DRAM - which is probably a safe bet.

With that performance level, the HW3 neural nets that I see in this could be run at 1000 frames per second (all cameras simultaneously).  This is massive overkill.  There‚Äôs little reason to run much faster than 40fps for a driving application.  The previously noted AKNET_V9 ‚Äúmonster‚Äù neural network requires something like 600 billion MACs to process one frame.  So a single ‚ÄúTRIP‚Äù, using the estimated performance above, could run AKNET_V9 at 66 frames per second. This is closer to the sort of performance that would make sense and AKNET_V9 would be about the size of network one would expect to see running on the trip given the above assumptions.‚Äù

* 12/15/21 - After me sending 10 emails and 5 calls to the roof coordinator he finally gets back to me and tells me that my emails were ""filtered out"". He just tells me roofing contractors will ""get back to me"" and then goes radio silence again.
* 01/19/21 - Tesla informs me that the loan I was approved for back in October didn't actually go through. This is exactly what happened to me previously with Mosaic in September. Terrible communication between lenders and tesla.
* 02/15/21 - A month straight of a million calls trying to figure out whats going on with lending, during this process I find out that the loan was actually denied back in November but that no one every informed me of this, and tesla didn't realize till Jan.
* 03/22/21 - It's clear funding via tesla isn't going to work. I decide to move forward with cash and just refinance the property later to cover the difference because I can't handle all the rejections with no reasons. I let tesla know I am proceeding with cash.
* 04 and 05 - Tesla attempts to find roofing contractor
* 05/31/21 - I sign agreement with roofers
* 06/14/21 - **Roof is installed in one day** (It took tesla 3 months to let me know a roof was needed, and 6 to find the company to do it)
* 07/06/21 - Permit is reapproved for solar (old one expired because it took so long)
* 07/12/21 - Installation appointment confirmed. **Installation is completed in ~2 days. Hurray!**
* 07/21/21 - I try to figure out why an inspection hasn't been done. Tesla says permits haven't been approved.
* 07/27/21 - I schedule the inspection on my own because tesla drags their feet on everything. I get it scheduled for the next day.
* 07/28/21 - I notify tesla about some issues with the installation, they left some debris on the roof, they accidentally swapped up some wires in the box and poked a hole through the ceiling in one location. I have reached out to them 4 or 5 times since then about these issues, but they were never handled. I ended up paying someone else to fix them.
* 07/29/21 - Tesla resubmits permits to the city
* 9/18/21 - Two straight months of me calling and contacting the city and tesla to figure out why in the world the panels are still not on.
* 9/20/21 - The city has requested the plans are changed from a 20kw system to a 19kw system. The actual system is 24kw so I have no clue what's going on here. I fear if I attempt to correct it will take even longer so I just let them sort it out.
* 9/30/21 - Approval finally happens
* 10/14/21 - I ask why system still isn't working 3 months after installation.
* 10/20/21 - **I turn on the solar panels!!!!!!!**. It's been well over a year at this point, and the panels have been sitting on the roof for 3 months doing absolutely nothing. I am so relived to finally be done with all this madness.
* 10/21/21 - I ask Tesla why I can't see the panels in my app. I call tesla and they let me know it's because I am not connected to wifi. This is the first time I am informed about this.
* 10/22/21 - They tell me they can connect to the inverter via cell connection to add them to the app, and that I should see the panels in my app shortly.
* 10/24/21 - Took several days, but panels are now showing up in app. They are only producing a small amount of power they should be, and it is saying none is going back to grid. I report the issue back to tesla but get no response.
* 11/05/21 - Keep reporting same issue to tesla, still no response. Decide to just wait for electric bill to come in because I assume there is just an issue with reporting and panels are working fine.
* 11/10/21 - I get a $650 electric bill. Bill should be near $0. Bill last year at this month was also ~$650. This makes me think that both the panels are not correctly sending energy back to the property AND to the power company. I attempt to reach out to tesla support. No answer.
* 11/11/21 - I try to contact a new support person since my old one is no longer responding. The website tells me to push a ""request service"" button at the bottom of the phone app. There is no ""request service"" at the bottom of the phone app. All buttons on the phone app link directly to the website. All links on the website link directly to the phone app.

Updates:

* 11/12/21 - Called the schedule service line and explained my issues. Was nice to speak to a human. They say they will escalate the case and that I should hear back by next Friday.
* 11/14/21 - Noticed I am experiencing an issue many others see where inverters will randomly shut off daily for about 10 minutes.
* 11/16/21 - They told me I had an appointment scheduled on the 17th and that they would call before arriving.
* 11/17/21 - They didn't call or show up for the appointment. I was unable to get ahold of anyone that knew what was going on.
* 12/01/21 - Tesla sent me a text message which I can't respond to saying I have a new appointment scheduled for 12/08. Fingers crossed they show up for that one.
* 12/08/21 - Technicians called me and said that they could tell that the panels were producing power, but that there may be issues with the inverters and reporting. They shut the panels off for four hours. They said they would fix it and I should be able to see it working properly in my app the next day.
* 12/12/21 - The app still doesn't work right. It's still showing energy is not being sent to the grid and not showing the correct values for the panels. I am going to wait for my next electric bill and then send them back if it still isn't working.
* 3/21/21 - I thought everything was working correctly because my Jan bill showed a ~50% ($500) reduction. However my February bill matched my amount from last year so I called back in. I have a 26.52 kW system. My peak output is 7.7 kW. My average month right now is 1,000 kwh of production/ 12,000 kwh per year but is supposed to be 47,000 kwh per year. I think the most likely cause is the inverters are not hooked up properly, but it could just be a reporting issue. I was told they would ""look into"" the refund I was supposed to get. The lady from tesla support is arguing that the 47k is an estimated number so my 12,000 should be fine and after over two hours on a call with a support line they refused to send out a technician. I am now attempting to submit an independent arbitration agreement.
* 4/19/22 - I called back to follow up on the status of the inverters still not working, my refund not being processed, and my independent arbitration agreement. For all 3 issues support said ""they would get back to me"". At least this time the support didn't try to gaslight me and argue that I didn't actually have an issue, and at least acted like they would eventually send a technician out.
* 4/27/22 - Tech was supposed to show today didn't. When I reached out to tesla they told me that he did show up, but can't tell me what he did there. Attempting to reschedule. Still haven't got ahold of arbitration.


I just want to be done with this hell. If anyone has a support phone number for tesla I would appreciate it.

TL:DR: Tesla solar support is terrible. Their prices might be great but I honestly don't think it's worth the hassle if something goes wrong.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/qs5iuh/took_over_a_year_to_get_my_solar_panels_installed/,gdubrocks,71952.0,0.9535
TeslaMotors,I want,c0e6oz,How Owning a Tesla Changed My Life,"Many of us here talk about the features of our cars, the newest firmware update, the little problems (and sometimes big), and nuances of owning and driving a Tesla.  But I want to shift the conversation for just a moment and speak to how owning a Tesla has impacted my life as a whole.  I emphatically encourage anyone else here to share your story, good or bad, as well.  So here goes...

&#x200B;

I commute about 3 hours a day in heavy LA traffic.  Next to NYC, it's probably the most grueling nightmare of lane changes, starting and stopping, praying to the Gods of Sidestreets that you can make it home with a fraction of your sanity still intact in the US.  The HOV lanes are a small reprieve at times, but often just as congested as the regular ones.  On any given day, most of us that live here probably in jest wish for a quick death to end it all just so we don't have to sit in another hour of traffic; yet somehow we prevail to drive another day.  We drove our dumb cars, in dumb traffic, with dumb people, and even dumber gas prices.  This was our plight, and yet we were resigned to it, even though with every breathe we said ""Dear Lord, why me?  What did I do to deserve this?""  We returned home fatigued, haggard, with barely enough energy to cook a good meal for ourselves or our families.  We fell asleep during movie night with our significant others because the road took what life we had left in us at the end of a long work day.

&#x200B;

Then Tesla came around and offered me an alternative.  While not perfect by any means it was light years better than what I'd ever experienced.  I've driven all sorts of beaters in my life, but my last was not what one would consider an uncomfortable car to drive.  My old 335d dutifully got me from point A to B while trying it's best to smooth the bumps in the road, however it was still a comparably a dumb car despite it's price tag.  When that car caught fire and burned to the ground because of a recall issue, I vowed to be brave and try something different.  Out of this wanderlust came my Model 3 LR AWD; a technological marvel.  I work in tech and can discern what's good and just mediocre.  From day one hopping into the frying pan of traffic and enabling the AP, I found a freedom I never knew before.  Throughout the long stretch of the 405 in LA it did nearly all the heavy lifting.  It kept me safe by ensuring I was the proper distance behind traffic to avoid rear ending someone, which is sometimes a challenge because of a vision depth perception issue I have with my eyes.  I no longer awoke in the morning dreading the day, the drive to and from work.  I trusted that this car, quiet, efficient, safe and smart would deliver me to my job and allow me to work to my full potential.  By the end of the day I immediately noticed that I had the energy and mental acuity to better tackle my tasks as a father and husband at home.  Even though it's been only a couple months of owning a Tesla Model 3 the nights where I told my daughter I was too exhausted to play Shopkins with her, or tell my wife that I didn't have the energy to cook us a good dinner is a thing of the past.  I'm so much happier now, and so are the people around me that I love the most.  Yes, there are sometimes little glitches.  Sure, sometimes service has lagged when I needed it.  But all in all, if I had to slap down the same amount of cash down on a car I'd buy this one again in a heartbeat.  I have the deepest amount of gratitude to Tesla for what it's given back to me; my life.  I have faith that it will only continue to get better over time with Full Self Driving, OTA updates, and improved service.  But what it's given thus far is so much, and means the world.  I never expected or thought that something as simplistic as a car could have such a deep impact on my life, but when it comes to my family and my ability to have what I need at the end of the day to give them what they are worth, it means everything.

TeslaMotors,I want,naah3s,My model 3 saved my life today,"To preface this, I was on my way home for the day in basically stopped traffic on a busy highway. I was in the right lane and wanted to move into the middle lane.

Problem was there were a lot of oncoming cars and almost no breaks in between them. I saw a decent sized gap coming in the cars and decided to try and change lanes as fast as I could. So I hit the accelerator, but my car moved about 2 feet and then stopped. No warnings or beeps, just stopped. For a split second I thought that was weird. After that brief moment I saw out my left side that a car had swerved into the middle lane (the one I was merging into) at a high speed moments before I tried to merge. The car stopped me from accelerating so I wouldn‚Äôt be T-boned by a large SUV at 70 mph. Thank you Tesla, you have a customer for life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/naah3s/my_model_3_saved_my_life_today/,pyroman56,2888.0,-0.6453
TeslaMotors,I want,ic8ct2,Awful customer experience,"I'm gonna try and make this is short as possible to not sound too much like a whiny bitch, but I never thought buying a $60k car would suck this much.

When taking delivery and spotting all the defects, the delivery rep told me ""don't worry they'll fix everything, just take photos of everything and make a service apt though the app"". I spotted so many things wrong that the app wouldn't even let me upload all the photos for 1 service appointment. So I made 2. Of course I had to wait over a week(past the window for returning the car) for my 1st apt.

Fast forward to today when I show up 10 mins early for my apt. I check in at a jam packed service center without any room to park. A few mins later I get a call from the service rep telling my apt is not for another 4 days. I say ""no, it's today. I'm looking at it right now in the app. You want me to send you a screenshot of it?"". He says, ""That's weird, okay I'll grab a guy and head over to you"".

Turns out my first appointment had been deleted by their system everywhere but on my app, along with all the photos I had submitted. So now I'm left trying to convince them that all these paint, alignment, headliner, leather, and glass issues where there when I picked up the car. Luckily I had not deleted the photos off my phone and they were dated.

We proceeded to mark all my concerns outside in the blazing heat with barely enough room around the car to maneuver. It was up to me to find all the photos on my phone in the direct noon sun, while they deflected most of my concerns with very carefully worded statements like ""we'll definitely check all these things out and make sure they are within spec."" and, ""You should definitely talk to someone about what they said to you at delivery"".

After becoming irritated and fatigued by the sun, trying to find all the dozens of spots that I had photos of, and their robotic canned answers, we concluded with, ""We're gonna need at least a few days, is there someone coming to pick you up?"".
What?! I replied ""Uh, no I'm expecting a loaner"". He replied with ""Sorry all our loaners are gone and there's a long waiting list that I can put you on. I can give you Uber vouchers"".

So here I am, fresh from spending 30 mins confined in a stranger's car during a pandemic, fielding questions about ""who I'm going to vote for"" and, am I going to take a vaccine ""designed by Bill Gates to control the population?"". I'm also fairly certain this guy thinks you're supposed to clean leather with cologne.

Right now I've got no vehicle, no idea if they will actually fix my car, possibly infected with covid 19, and absolutely stinking of cologne. This is enough to say ""never again"".

TeslaMotors,I want,pib9ii,Tesla as an evacuation vehicle - better than expected,"We used our 2018 Model X 75D as our evacuation vehicle for Ida.  I wasn't sure how well it would go, but now I will never evacuate  without a Tesla.

Evacuation traffic - Charge is amazing - it will go for days in stop and go traffic.  We usually make it to the supercharger with ~7% left after going 80 the whole way.  After 4 hours of traffic we made it with 30%

Supercharging - no lines at all, probably an advantage that I am in the deep south where people still think that it is a gimmick so we don't have many Teslas about.

I came back to the city early with it and brought gas and generators for people.  I have a trailer hitch carrier and I know there are pictures of me going around as a meme.  But because I had basically unlimited energy with a supercharger online 10 miles away, I had no issues driving around and giving out gas and generators and wasn't wasting gas to do it.

9000w Gas generator will charge the tesla without issues.  I tried it and it worked only because I wanted to know.  Didn't actually need to charge it with a generator.

TeslaMotors,I want,6giiao,My Model X 90D Driver Side Falcon door opened on Freeway driving 65mph with my 6 y.o. sitting next to it,"Please see below our Tesla Experience... any input as to how we can share our story for child safety and expedite our refund from Tesla would be appreciated.  This is our email to the service manager of Tesla

Hi Sandra

I‚Äôm writing to you as per our telephone conversation to formally request Tesla to refund the cost of our Model X 90D vehicle due to its compliance with the California Lemon Law.  We purchased the car on January 5, 2017 and has had a slew of problems that will be detailed below.  However, the most notable problem that fall under the California Lemon Law is the driver side falcon door; which despite at least three attempts to fix opened while driving on the highway.  Thus it would fall under the part of the law that states, ‚Äú Your vehicle‚Äôs problems could cause death or serious bodily injury if it is driven, and the manufacturer or dealer has made at least two unsuccessful repair attempts.‚Äù

As a recap of our conversation, you state that you have contacted the legal team and they responded that if the car is in compliance with the California Lemon Law the refund should be a ‚Äúslam dunk.‚Äù  This process will take between 4-8 weeks and you will assist in attempting to shorten the time as you have done successfully before.  You were also adamant in helping us understand that you have had your engineers meticulously check through the car and replace the faulty parts.  The car has now passed the quality checks and we are to return the loaner and pick up our car to drive as normal until the refund is fully processed.  We were also asked to verbally approve a 100 mile test drive so that Tesla can do its due diligence for their quality check.    However, since the faulty parts that were replaced are the same that has been done before without full resolution of the problem I voiced my concerns in continuing to drive the car.  As we purchased this car specifically for our parents who have difficulty getting in and out of our higher cars, we would feel more assured if Tesla can give us a definitive assurance that the door has been fixed since we are forced to drive the car until the refund is complete.  You informed us that Tesla, as well as any automakers in the world would never give that sort of assurance that their fix would not break again.  As my six year old son was sitting next to the falcon door that opened on the highway, this is an answer that is very difficult for me to accept.  I had pleaded with you to consult with your legal team to make sure that we are really unable to keep the loaner because driving the faulty car will give us additional anxiety. Also if the door is potentially not fixed the damages may be much more serious the next time and perhaps irrecoverable. My suggestion is as much for our family‚Äôs safety as well as Tesla‚Äôs decreased liability.  You informed me that there is nothing more you can do for us.  As the car is now ready for pickup on Friday and Tesla has a 72 hour window for pick up you have given us clearance for pick up of car on monday June 12, 2017. 

Below I will go into a detailed timeline of our experience with Tesla.  I hope this will help the refund go smoothly and efficiently.

On Sept. 21, 2015 we reserved our Model X

On Jan. 11, 2016, we configured our Model X. 

On Jan. 5, 2017 we picked up the car and brought it home, there was warning sign that there was low windshield fluid and the software needed to be updated at the service center only.  Thus the car was not fully serviced upon delivery of car. 

On Jan. 7, 2017 We were heading to a children‚Äôs birthday party.  The car started to beep non stop on the freeway.  We had to pull over and call roadside assistance for help to reset the car twice before it returned to normal. 

On Jan. 9 2017, we brought back car and they updated software which took more than a few hours.  They also filled the windshield wiper fluid to full.  

When we took the car back home, after a couple of hours, we realized our garage was flooded with windshield wiper fluid.  Apparently the windshield wiper fluid container was cracked.


On Jan. 10, 2017, we brought the car back but they didn't have parts and we waited a week for it to come in.

Meanwhile while we were doing paperwork for rebate and the HOV lane stickers, we realized the VIN on all our paperwork were incorrect and we had to contact sales to get them rectified and resign all paperwork.

On Jan. 16, 2017, we brought in the car to fix the windshield wiper fluid container and resign all the paperworks.  

At this service we met Tanya, Service Adviser, who informed us if we had any issues to personally contact her and she will assist us at her utmost.  However as the problems continue to arise, Tanya no longer responded to our communications after the April falcon door incident. 

Along the way, while more frequently on the highway driving, we realized we were hearing wind sounds coming in from the right side passenger window. Also the passenger side falcon door was squeaking

On Jan 26, 2017 we brought the car back and the technician found the seal was not installed properly on the window and changed a new one.  The door was also readjusted.  

On Jan 28, 2017 while at the mall the driver side falcon door was unable to open no matter which button you press.  However the car read the door as being opened.  We immediately called roadside assistance, they advised since the car seems safe to drive we should drive to our service center as it was a Saturday and they were still open.  See service report to see work done.  We picked up the car on Jan 30, 2017. 

After this service, we were upset at how many times we'd visited this service center since pickup and they offered Tesla merchandise as compensation but we said no. We would at least want the first year service free.  They agreed. 

In March, the passenger side window with which they fixed the seal became increasingly squeaky when opening and closing the window. Thus we had to bring it in to service on Mar. 27, 2017 to fix. 

On April 23, 2017 at the Water Grill Restaurant in Costa Mesa, the driver side falcon door was unable to open again despite pressing all different buttons.  We left message at service center as they were closed on a Sunday and called roadside assistance to reinforce to the service center that we will need service on our car ASAP due to the car beeping that the door is open when it is not.  Roadside assistance reassured us the car should be safe to drive due to it being ok the first time this happened.  However, once we got home after 45 minutes the car was still on because the falcon door is read as open.  Roadside assistance request to manually turn off car and leave door open overnight as any motion in the car would turn it back on again. Roadside assistance was also confused as why the car did not turn off itself after 45 minutes as it should with no movement.  

On April 24, 2017 we brought in the car for the fix and on April 25, 2017 we were called to pick up the car as ready.  However on April 25 upon pickup the technician was demonstrating that the door was fixed but after one attempt the door became stuck again and had to be immediately put back to be serviced.  Despite the fact there is only one service ticket for this fix, it should technically be counted as two as they were delivering the car to us the door broke and we had to make an extra trip on April 26, 2017 to pick up the car they reassured us was fixed.  

On June 2, 2017 we were at Toy R Us in costa mesa with our parents and our 6 year old son, a total of 5 people.  For context, my son sits next to the driver side falcon door, me in the center and my mom on the right. My husband and father are in the front.  As we were leaving, the left side falcon door was stuck again.  We immediately called the service center due to it being Friday but since it was late in the day we left a message as they were already closed. We started to drive home because through our previous experience we were always advised to drive the car back to the service center as the car is still drivable.  During the ride, I was calling the roadside assistance to write up a ticket to reinforce to the service center to call us to schedule service first thing in the morning. While on the phone with roadside assistance, I head a click in the door and the motor as the door started to lift open.  I grabbed onto the door with my left hand and held on and the door had about a 2-3 inch gap.  We had been on the road for approximately 15 minutes at this time and were on the 5 north freeway right before the Tustin Ranch Exit.  We immediately exited and parked in the Tustin auto center.  The door opened once we parked and clicked closed once the button was pressed. As we were close to home and can drive home via local streets, we drove home.  We informed roadside assistance to immediately set up a tow first thing in the morning on Saturday as my son‚Äôs birthday party was on that day.  In our eyes, the car was not safe to drive and we were all severely traumatized by that event.  Had the door opened the damages would have been irrecoverable and my son‚Äôs life was put in imminent danger, a feeling no parent should ever have to feel.  

As it is, we are still forced to drive this car by Tesla due to our parents physical limitations.  Per Roger the head technician during our phone call on Jun 6, 2017 he is confident that he had pinpointed the problem of the door and he was very apologetic in not doing a more comprehensive check the few times before we came in for this problem. He is confident that the problem is fixed however Sandra you are unable to do the same before we pick up the car again. Again, the conflicting messages worry me for the sake of my family‚Äôs safety. 

We had high hopes for Tesla as indicated by how long we wait for our car. We are severely disappointed by the quality of the our Tesla and the customer service that we are receiving.  Please review our case as soon as possible as we do not feel safe in this car.  Please send me a confirmation that you have sent in our formal request to the legal team and they are actively processing our case. 

Thank you

TL/DR model x falcon door faulty, attempt to fix 3 times, opened during driving on highway, put my child in danger, tesla wants us to continue to drive car, won't guarantee its fixed until they might/might not refund car based on lemon law

Help: I did not lock this post for comments, how do i unlock it.  The post has been unblocked by the community moderators on 6/12, thank you to those assist me in doing this. 

We have just connected with Jon McNeil and he seems eager to assist us to resolve this issue.  We will have to wait and see for the final results.

I hope he helps us resolve this issue quickly.  I see that there are many who think we've sensationalized our story but unfortunately it is all true. It is really disheartening. Perhaps ""pooled"" may have been a better word than ""flooded"" but it doesn't take away from the fact that they delivered a over 6 figures car with a defect that should have been caught during their strict quality checks.  However the main point is still the falcon door opened while we were driving on the freeway.  We're grateful to be safe.  We are hoping that they will let us keep loaner until the refund process is complete and that is all.  That being said, we can't control everyone's opinions and we're not trying to, just sharing our experience so other who are considering the car can make more informed decision, especially parents.

TeslaMotors,I want,j595ns,So Tesla‚Äôs quality control is really bad. Our brand new model y‚Äôs entire roof just fell off,"My dad bought a brand new model Y today, and he brought me along to pick it up just in case he needed help with any tech problems. Everything was going fine and we were driving back home when we started to hear a ton of wind. I thought maybe a window was open but a minute later the entire glass roof just blew off.  After a brief panic we turned around and drove the new Tesla convertible back to the dealership.

When we got back we called highway patrol to tell them that there was a car roof somewhere on the 580, but somebody might have gotten into an accident, I‚Äôm not sure. The manager at the dealership said that either the seal for the roof was faulty, or the factory just ... forgot to seal the roof on? I can‚Äôt imagine how something as big as the roof not being attached could make it past quality control. Has this ever happened before?

Edit: The manager offered to get the car serviced for free, but we declined and are probably going to get an entirely new car. Whether we're still getting a Tesla is up to my dad but probably not.

TeslaMotors,I want,d7vvya,Some days I don't want to know what happens to my car while I'm gone,"[https://youtu.be/eYFpAgFizvY](https://youtu.be/eYFpAgFizvY)

My partner and I went to Colorado for vacation a few weeks ago and decided to go out to dinner in downtown Colorado Springs one evening. Other than it being our 13th anniversary, it had already been an eventful day - first that morning we noticed the rear license plate on the car had been stolen the night before (and I had screwed up formatting the TeslaCam drive so it didn‚Äôt record, doh!), followed by a pretty intense hike in the mountains for most of the afternoon. So we were looking for a chill evening.

Parked the car downtown, thinking nothing of it since it looked to be a decent area, and went to dinner. However, when I reached for the door handle and pressed it in, I heard clicking noises from the mirror - it was already extended. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Is going through my mind, then I see it‚Ä¶.five million fingerprints all over the thing. My heart sank - I couldn‚Äôt see much else on the car since it was dark outside, but my worry shot up instantly. The first thing I noticed once I got into the car was that both side mirrors were out of whack. Thankfully that was fixable by going back into Easy Entry, then selected my profile again to force things back into position.

Once we got back to our AirBnB I pulled up the TeslaCam video and found six and a half minutes (!) of video showing what a dude was doing to my car while we were eating.

For those who TL;DW‚Ä¶

\- dude sits on the frunk lid multiple times

\- dude forces both side mirrors out forcefully

\- dude walks around the car repeatedly rubbing his hands on the paint

\- dude repeatedly tries to open the doors, appearing to pull pretty hard on the handles

\- dude tries to clean off his butt print/finger prints from the frunk lid using his sleeve

I am soooo thankful there wasn‚Äôt any lasting damage other than the finger oils all over - a quick trip to the car wash took care of that.

Of course after multiple car related incidents that day, my significant other had to make the snarky comment that this wouldn‚Äôt have happened with his Accord‚Ä¶lol. My response - he would have never known!

(On a slightly related/unrelated note: Driving across Kansas to/from Colorado was amazingly easy with the Supercharger network. The only issue of note was trying to plan on avoiding the Goodland, KS Supercharger since four of the six stalls were down at the time we were passing through - thankfully I had looked at comments on Plugshare before leaving so we were aware and instead charged in Colby.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/d7vvya/some_days_i_dont_want_to_know_what_happens_to_my/,J0ul3s,2691.0,0.9767
TeslaMotors,I want,rpvjtr,V11 interface theory...it's for first-time Tesla owners more than anything.,"The v11 interface has plenty of stuff for long-time Tesla drivers like the blind spot camera and light show and so on, but it's the interface changes that are bothering us.

Perhaps the biggest complaint is that things that used to be right there on the bottom bar are now hidden in a menu (sometimes two layers deep).

After using it for a bit, I have a theory about why things are the way they are. With the ""apps"" being draggable, that sort of makes sense...they're preparing for a future where there are more apps. Perhaps an app store, or maybe just more apps and services. 

But with the controls, I think this release is acknowledging that the ""new Tesla owner"" experience can be a little confusing and the company clearly plans for there to be a LOT of new customers over the next year or two. They're at a 1M/yr run rate now and have two plants coming online in the next 3-4 months.

When someone buys their first Tesla, as I did a year ago, it's a little confusing how some things are on the bottom bar, some things are in the main car screen menu, and some things are in submenus. It's not clear which controls you can work from the steering wheel and which only work on the screen. 

This release, for all its faults, does two things well. One, it puts pretty much all the critical driving stuff on ONE screen. You tap the car icon, and all the things you need while driving are right there. There's more on that screen, it's a better use of space, it's clearer for first-time Tesla owners. Odds are if you want to know ""how do I [common car thing you do while driving]"" it's on that screen when you tap the car icon.

If you ever use the screen to do something you can do with the steering wheel, a little tutorial popup appears to tell you how you can use the knobs on the steering wheel (like if you skip forward on a music track or adjust the volume). I don't recall ever seeing that before.

I think they've got a little work to do, sure. Showing dual AC controls when the AC isn't split is more confusing than not and takes up valuable space. They could allow a few more icons on the toolbar, they don't need a ""recently used apps"" section, and if they let us drag most common controls down there instead of just apps it would solve nearly all problems.

But I think, from the 30,000-foot view, this update probably makes the ""first time Tesla"" experience a bit less confusing. And it seems to me, with the huge number of anticipated first-time Tesla owners over the coming year or two, that may have been a primary motive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/rpvjtr/v11_interface_theoryits_for_firsttime_tesla/,jasoncross00,73389.0,0.6708
TeslaMotors,I want,ceftpj,2 weeks with my first Tesla (MX): NOT the best car I've owned.,"Every car I've owned since my ¬£220 ford escort estate right up to my ¬£30,000 Audi S5 convertible has been in several ways better and a lovely evolution of my car experiences.  Faster, more comfortable, better tech, better build quality.  Every car has been a better car in some way.   I work extremely, save up, and get the rewards with a better car.

&#x200B;

I was expecting the same with Tesla.   I was wrong.

&#x200B;

Had I got the Jaguar F-PACE SVR (or Porsche Cayenne Turbo) that I wanted to get instead, it would almost certainly be a better car in many ways, just like my previous upgrades. Tesla, however, is not  a better car.  It is totally demeaning to suggest so.  Yes, it's better, but it's not in the same league as ""a car"".   Yes ok it has wheels and you can drive it around like you do a car, but other than that the experience is something completely different.    Yes it's (MUCH) faster,  yes it's nice inside but... that's really it.   It doesn't drive like a car, it doesn't act like a car.

&#x200B;

I wake in the morning, open the app and remind myself where I parked it, I check to see that it has been updated and what new features it has, I check to see how much is ""in the tank"" and then I check the temperature and if too hot or cold I ask it to prepare the temperature for me as I shower.  I walk to the thing and the door opens for me and I sit in, it closes.  A huge glorious screen reminds me what meetings I have on for the day as the seats and steering wheel jiggle me into my favourite driving position.   I talk to it and it brings up a load of music I want it play.   I tell it where I want to go and the glorious screen gives me a load of options I can either call or just drive to.   I then start driving.  Without having to turn the thing on by pressing a button or inserting a key.  It just drives.   But driving is an unfair description in this case - it doesn't drive the way I know it, it kind of glides.   I sit there in silence as I glide around effortlessly.  A grunting muscle-car revs his dinosaur at me at the lights and within seconds he's a spec in my rear mirror as I glide away at what should be terrifying speeds in a car, but feels like teleportation in this thing.  Teh throttle isn't a throttle it's a teleportation pedal. Press it and you get instant torque and are where you want to be in soothing silence.  Before I know it I'm on a slightly wider road (no not a motorway, just a simple A or B road) and I flick autopilot and I'm just sitting there looking around at the scenery as it twists and turns and take  me through traffic. I flick through radio stations and discover new music in the meantime.   I get to my destination, glide into my space, get out the car and the doors just all close and it locks itself up. \[this isn't made up this is all a daily actual experience\]

&#x200B;

For anyone who doesn't have a Tesla this all seems like exaggeration of little perks, but it's not, it's basically all amounts to a  completely different experience.

&#x200B;

This is not a car, it feels like some sort of UFO type thing.  Some sort of robot beast you sit in that happens to have wheels and use them on the roads.   Drives don't feel like drives they feel like robot teleportation experiences.   They are so much more relaxing, and when I want it to be, they're sooo much more fun too, like when I humiliated a Jaguar F-Type on windy roads on Saturday.

&#x200B;

This is why this feels NOTHING like my previous experiences of just getting a better car. This thing is no more a car than the best smartphone is an old wired-in landline telephone.   An iPhone bears the name phone but in truth it's a palm sized portable PC and camera that can also make calls.   I've left cars behind.  This is a technological beast or ""robot"" as my daughter calls it, that has wheels, moves on the road in a majestic way and resembles what we used to call cars.  I've not got a better car, I've now got a Tesla.

&#x200B;

Welcome to the future! :)

TeslaMotors,I want,bozlcs,I want to upgrade from a Chevy Volt. What do I really need?,"I'm currently leasing a 2017 Chevy Volt. My lease runs out next March. When that happens, I'd like to finally join the ranks of the Tesla owners. I'd like to know what I actually need, as opposed to what it would just be nice to have. I'm hoping you can help me decide.

I'm usually driving from my house to the train station and back, with the occasional drive from the suburbs to the city. I average about 20 miles per day (and the longest trip I make with any frequency is about 100 miles in a day), so I'm not overly concerned with range. 

My main question is whether I need the dual-motor AWD. I live in the Chicago area, so I'm concerned about potentially driving a rear wheel drive car in the snow and ice. Is RWD a real option for rough winters, or should I only consider the AWD models?

Secondly, how important is the self-driving/autopilot? I can see how it would be useful for long car trips, but I don't really take long car trips. Would I regret getting a model that doesn't have it?

I guess it all boils down to whether I could get away with a bare-bones, RWD Model 3 with no added bells and whistles, or whether I'd at least need the AWD for the winters. And if I'm looking at the price point around $55-60k, would it make more sense to look at a used Model S?

I had ~20k saved up as a safety net before the inheritance, and I would honestly take either part or all of it to use as a down payment. I would be getting the SR+ rear wheel drive option (~40k)

I could end up with a loans that look like this:

20k down plus trade in for a 13k loan (48 mo, 2.99%*) for a monthly payments of $288

Sometimes the car can get a little paranoid and sound the alarm for something quite innocuous (such as approaching a car's rear a little too quickly, or being a little close to someone walking up on the ***path***). If it must sound the alarm (and maybe a quieter, less ear-piercing alarm when it's less sure so we don't get desensitized over the car that cried wolf), please give us directional cues so we can look to see where the danger may occur.

A Prius-sized cybertruck, without the air suspension, and a classic hatchback would be a better fit for the European market IMHO, and I'm pretty sure it would be cheaper than the base model of the 3 or Y, which makes it the perfect vehicle for Tesla's mission of hastening the transition to renewables.

TeslaMotors,I want,gysero,4 things my BMW 5 series did better than my M3P...,"So I've officially completed just over a month with my M3P and I'm in love. As a daily commuter, it's just brilliant. Simple, comfortable, and very satisfying to drive.

With that said, there are a few things that seem glaringly inferior when compared to my previous experience with BMW. Full disclosure: I'm a car fanatic, and pledge loyalty to no brand. I love cars for what they are and rotate through new cars every 12-16 months or so because I love to try new things. There's no hate to Tesla here, just some observations on what I think could be easily improved via software.

**1. Deactivating the car alarm is an utter FAIL.**

So using your mobile phone (iPhone 11 Pro here) as the car's key is brilliant. While it isn't perfect and can take a moment to connect via Bluetooth when approaching the car sometimes, it's mostly pretty flawless. I really enjoy the experience. It's something I love, *except* when the alarm unintentionally goes off.

One really poor example is when I went into a restaurant to grab take-out while my wife and 2 young daughters stayed in the car. I set HVAC to stay on and brought my phone in with me for mobile payments. As I was returning to my car my wife opened the passenger door to grab the food from me. But because my phone hadn't connected via Bluetooth yet, her opening the door triggered the alarm by opening the door from within.

This immediately triggered the alarm. 

If you haven't experienced the alarm, here's a quick synopsis of what its like. It's ALARMING ;)

Now imagine what it's like being inside the car still.

Heavy metal Bach music is blaring at 5000% volume, and there is NO obvious way to minimize the volume (due to lack of volume knob like a traditional car). I mean I get that it makes sense to add it because its the alarm, but seriously, it was dangerously loud for an adult, let alone a very young child inside the car.

Of course, anyone standing in front of their car is going to feel befuddled as they grope around their pockets for their key to disable the alarm only to remember that your phone is your key. Now you have to grab your phone, unlock it, open the Tesla app, and then ""unlock"" your car, all while your occupants are having their eardrums melted by the ""modern"" theft-deterrent system blasting heavy metal at 5000% volume. A ""traditional"" car could be deactivated by jamming a button on your key fob while the keys are still in your pocket. As a first-time Tesla phone-key alarm deactivator, there was simply NO warning or preparation for this kind of experience. Totally not cool. 

This seems like a glaring oversight. Not only was it an embarrassing experience for me and my family, but also any bystander who doesn't appreciate Teslas would be watching as music is blasting and thinking ""why the heck would I want my car to do that?"" Worse though, what if there was an infant in their car seat while my wife was also in the car? That could cause literal physical damage to a very young baby and there is NO apparent way to turn off any alarm quickly.

Serious fail. C'mon Elon.

* There has to be a better way to deactivate the alarm, or, proactively determine what sets off an alarm. For the latter, why can't it use the seat sensors to sense whether someone is in the car? Or the internal camera? Or use the HVAC setting to leave it ""On"" when I leave the car (or combination of both) to predict that someone may still be in the car. Or best yet, once the phone has connected via Bluetooth, deactivate the alarm. Or a push notification on my phone pops up to deactivate quickly. Finally, a deactivation method to type in a 4-digit pin on the screen would have been VERY helpful in this situation. But without any warning, the pin may not have been super obvious.

While I love the Model 3s minimalism and simplicity, there doesn't seem to be enough oversight on this functionality and how one would want disarm false alarms. It made me embarrassed to own a Tesla to say the least, and the 5 people watching us nearby were probably assuming that Tesla drivers love blasting annoying music and pissing everyone off around them.

**2. Remind the driver that they left their phone in the wireless charging tray.**

It's only been a month, but I've left my phone in the charging tray at least a dozen times now after leaving the car. Since I use the phone as my key, this is kind of a problem. My (18+) BMW M5 would notify me on the dash, and with an audible signal, that a phone is in the charging tray whenever I put it into park and opened the driver's door.

Considering that the UI notifies me when I'm closing the center console too hard (and it not sticking), I think this is a simple request.

* PLEASE, can you just set up a UI reminder that I have a phone to grab, especially because it is THE KEY? You could even make it a toggle in case people don't like it.

**3. Tesla is known for its automated (or semi-automated) driving capabilities, but my BMW was superior in two simple ways.**

When activated on the freeway, my BMW seemed far more ""simple"" in its semi-automated driving. 

First, the steering wheel resistance amount required on my M3P to not trigger a ""warning, hands on the wheel"" seems far too little on the M3P. I'll have my hands on the wheel and it won't detect them. While that is kind of annoying, it gets worse when you apply some resistance and accidentally kick it out of autopilot.

Second, the more frustrating part, is that once you ""kick it out of autopilot"", you have to manually reactivate it. My BMW would automatically turn back on once you put your hands on the wheel, and, even after changing lanes. It would stay on completely until you turned it off. 

When I change lanes in the M3P, it deactivates autopilot and then you have to turn it back on. It gets old after about 3 times of doing this and then you just don't want to use the feature anymore because of how annoying it is.

* Allow Autopilot to turn back on after a lane change. I don't want to have to think about Autopilot again when I feel the need to take over the car temporarily. 

Thirdly, the reactivity of the active cruise control to decelerate when approaching a car in front seems far more excessive than the BMW did. It will decelerate in a much more extreme way and is quite jarring in some instances. This would require a more refined sensitivity level, but, just my opinion on this last one.

**4. Allow users to adjust the lower UI controls.**

I think the UI in the M3 is far superior than the MS I drove in 2018. The always-on controls on the bottom of the screen are helpful, but I would LOVE the ability to customize them.

Two things I will likely never use in AZ: the front or rear defroster, and the seat heaters. That takes up valuable UI space for something I would rather have: 1) rear HVAC on/off, 2) Fan speed (non auto mode), 3) other.

For #1, since I live in AZ, the AC will be used basically ever day for 9 months. I would love a quick toggle to turn the rear AC on and off. Sometimes I have the kiddos with me, sometimes I don't. Right now I leave it always on so I don't have to mess with it, but obviously that uses more energy than needed. This would be quite welcome.

For #2, when in auto mode, the fan speeds adjust based on the thermostat setting. But if you don't want it in auto, then you have to enter the additional HVAC menu and make adjustments there. I'd love to manually control fan speed from the lower permanent UI than having to go into a menu.

For #3, I love seeing the energy consumption graph. Not a deal breaker that it takes 2 taps to get there, but I'll never use the heated seats or front/rear defroster icons. I don't need those taking up 20% of icon space, especially when I accidentally turn on the heated seat when reaching for the HVAC temp control.

* Suggestion: allow users to edit the lower UI icons. Take a play from Apple (or any other smartphone) and allow your main buttons to be customizable. The Macbook's Touch Bar is completely customizable and has a very intuitive interface to do so.

TeslaMotors,I want,8s94gr,[Discussion] How should I jack up my Model 3 if I want to do a wheel change? Which floor jack/jack stands?,"The Model 3 has really small jack points: https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/jack-points.102793/

I want to change my own tires and whatnot, but due to the small jack points I don't know how best to do this. Obviously messing this up can puncture the battery liner so I don't want to make mistakes.

For the actual floor jack to get it off the ground, would something like this work? https://www.amazon.com/Pro-Lift-F-767-Profile-Floor/dp/B00BG6IJA0 I would use a hockey puck on the contact point to better disperse weight.

Most jack stands look something like this: https://www.amazon.com/Torin-Big-Steel-Jack-Stands/dp/B00026Z3E0/ref=sr_1_2_sspa where they're supposed to go on the the ""pinch weld"" point under the car, but the Model 3 doesn't have that. What kind should I be getting?

You can get an adapter like this: https://www.ebay.com/itm/142709055354 but with a cost of $50 x 4, $200 in adapters to lift the car up is a bit much.

So what would you do if you had to go out and buy a floor jack and jack stands? Please don't say ""I would take it to my local mechanic"" because there's almost no Teslas in my small city and I'd be equally afraid of a lazy mechanic not paying attention and puncturing the battery. I've read horror stories.

And dumb question but can I just jack up the very front/back of the car where it's grey in the above diagram, rather than having to use the jack points?

It looks like it's fixed. My car is no longer telling me I need a payment method and it's no longer tell me I'm blocked from supercharging. I haven't gone to a supercharger yet, but I'm hopeful. After this thread started getting traction and my tweets got some re-tweets. u/TrepidatiousBuffalo reached out to me as well as 3 reps from Tesla AND I finally heard back from Erik via email. Somebody did something (I think u/TrepidatiousBuffalo) did something because all the sudden I was able to make a payment online with a button that wasn't there before and the errors were gone. So after nearly 3 weeks, I THINK this is finally fixed.

To u/TrepidatiousBuffalo, Wyatt, Andry, Arshkit, or Erik (was beginning to wonder if you were real). Thanks for helping.

To all the people who responded with constructive ideas or simply just to share my pain and frustrations. Thanks, I appreciate it.

To all the people who thought it was hilarious that I would consider suing because I'm not entitled to supercharging or whatever dumb reason. Fuck you people. Just because you're so brainwashed that you'll eat shit while saying thank you doesn't mean I should too. Legal or not, have a case or not, this is simply not how you treat customers. Period.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Looking for some thoughts from the community here.

Starting on Oct 27, 2020, after a stop at a supercharger, my M3P said I am blocked from supercharging because there is no credit card on my account, however, I do have a credit card on my account. I called customer service to figure out what is going on and they found out my supercharging is connected to someone else‚Äôs account and that this issue will have to be escalated to another team to fix.

For the time being, if I want to supercharge, I must call customer service, tell them the situation, then they unlock **ONE** supercharging session for me.

So far it‚Äôs been:

* 19 days since this started
* 8 calls to customer service (on 2 of these calls they swore it was fixed, it wasn‚Äôt)
* No timeline to get this fixed
* A guy named Eric is in charge of my problem, at least 4 times CSRs have told me that Eric will call me back soon. I still have never heard from Eric.

I had a road trip planned for this weekend, but it looks like I won‚Äôt be able to go because I only get 1 charging session at a time and customer service is closed on the weekends. So, I can‚Äôt take my $72,000 car more than 150 miles from home.

On top of this, I noticed that my supercharging history since this ordeal started is not showing up on my account at all, so it stands to reason that this other person can see exactly where and when I‚Äôm supercharging. I asked a CSR point blank if this other person can see my charging details and the CSR was unable to confirm that the other person can‚Äôt see my details. So, this could be a privacy and data breach issue as well.

I‚Äôm not a litigious guy, but I‚Äôm not seeing another option here. Does anyone have any suggestions before I engage a lawyer?

EDIT:  I know it's a long shot, but I've been tweeting u/Tesla and u/Elonmusk about this and have had no response either.

TeslaMotors,I want,eztiow,FordPass‚Ñ¢ Charging Network VS. Tesla Charging Network,"I have a friend who is a ""Ford guy"", and every time I talk about Tesla, he ""throws in my face"" that Ford has the largest charging network in the country. Ignoring the fact that you can't even buy a fully electric Ford at this point (Mach-E isn't available yet), I wanted to try and get to the bottom of this claim.

The Culprit: [Official Ford announcement ""North America's Largest Electric Vehicle Charging network.""](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2019/10/17/ford-introduces-north-americas-largest-electric-vehicle-charting-network.html)

Several media sites have created their own articles based on this announcement, that Ford has the largest network of EV charging sites. This is very misleading because if you go to [Ford's EV charging locator map](https://www.ford.com/buy-site-wide-content/overlays/try-the-tech/), you'll quickly discover that their ""network"" of chargers are simply [Chargepoints](https://www.chargepoint.com/), [Electrify America](https://www.electrifyamerica.com/index), [Greenlots](https://greenlots.com/), and other third-party charging networks. **Ford has zero exclusive charging stations.**

Most of the charging locations in the FordPass‚Ñ¢ Charging Network are public stations where you can ***also charge a Tesla***. *(EDIT: Some people have pointed out that Teslas can't charge at ALL of the same chargers as the Mach-E, for instance, due to adaptor restrictions.)* Therefore, Tesla clearly has the largest network of chargers when you add their Supercharger and Destination charger network. Ford is implying that they have a superior exclusive network over Tesla, and that's just false. All they did is pay these companies a licensing fee so they can call their chargers part of the FordPass‚Ñ¢ Charging Network. The only benefit offered by Ford is two years of ""access"" to the network, but you still have to pay for all your electricity. *(EDIT: Some people have mentioned that the Ford network offers a discount on charging at these stations, but I haven't found a source to back up this claim.)*

>Ford is providing two years of complimentary ***access*** to North America's largest network ‚Äì the FordPass Charging Network ‚Äì for easy and convenient ***pay-as-you-drive*** charging.

I don't even see a benefit of ""complementary access"", because [Chargepoint membership is free](https://www.chargepoint.com/drivers/), and it gives you access to 80% of other Level 2 (AC) networks and 99% of DC fast chargers. You pay for the electricity, of course, just like you would through the Ford program.

TeslaMotors,I want,y2bwo8,Things I wish my Model 3 had,"I have a 2020 M3P with over 50K miles on it and have driving across the USA several times and here is what I'd like to see in no specific order or priority:

\- Bring back radar, Vision SUCKS. Way more phantom braking events, and autopilot slows down in foggy conditions when with radar it did not. Also, radar would show cars in front of me 2 or 3 deep, now with vision, all I see is the one in front on my visualization screen. Although, vision seems to do a better job at lane-keeping. So, a hybrid radar/vision might be best. It‚Äôs so bad that I rarely use autopilot anymore because when I do, I‚Äôm always on edge, ready to unintentionally brake check someone at a moment‚Äôs notice. You know a function is badly designed when the user is incentivized to NOT use that function. One of the biggest reasons I and probably most people bought Tesla was because of autopilot, and now it‚Äôs degraded to the point of not using it. 

\- Implement a dumb cruise control that only keeps the speed constant like every other car. I don't want phantom braking and making people angry behind me who think I brake checked them, I don't want to slow down in foggy conditions or around curves, I don't want lane keeping, I don't want distance keeping, I don't want 85 MPH to be my top limit. I just want the speed kept constant as if I had my foot on the accelerator and nothing else. 

\- Allow switching of accelerations speeds by tapping the ""chill"" word, just like tapping the battery changes it from % to miles. Or have different driving profiles available at the tap of a button, like the M buttons on BMW M cars. I don‚Äôt want to change my entire Driver profile to do this. 

\- Fix the music UI where half the song's name and band can't be seen even though there is plenty of real estate in the music bar. Show the time/time remaining in the song instead of just having the status bar at the bottom. 

\- Allow us to turn on/off the driver and passenger HVAC independently. I know you can change temps on both sides independently, but sometimes I just want mine on when there is not passenger or when my passenger doesn't want air in their face without having to change the direction of the air flow every time. 

\- Speaking of HVAC, for the love of God get rid of that stupid SLIDER to change fan speed. It‚Äôs thin and very hard to use while driving. It obviously didn‚Äôt go through real world driving tests. Go back to having large + or ‚Äì buttons to change it. In fact, make all buttons large and easily accessible and get rid of any sliders anywhere. 

\- Get rid of the auto-wipers and auto-high beams when in autopilot. I hate when I have no control over functions of the car. If vision requires both to be on, then vision isn't good. Go back to radar and keep ultrasonics. 

\- If possible, give the M3P a slight acceleration boost, even if at the top end. There used to be a large gap between the M3P and M3LR, which is what distinguished the two and why people paid a premium for it. Track mode is a nice distinction, but not enough. The acceleration boost for the LR was a money grab and diminished the value of the M3P. I know they don't want to eat into Model S sales, but people who get the Model S/X are probably more into the luxury aspect that pure speed (I could be wrong). 

\- Go back to the Apple IOS style UI/Icons and not this Android looking one. It doesn't fit the aesthetic of the car. 

\- Allow customization of how many ""clicks"" a turn signal includes. 3 is way too short

\- Allow us to have different ‚Äústyles‚Äù of UI. For example, I could have a Road-trip style, which increases the map size and gets rid of the 3D car animation. I could have a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù style, which shows speed and gear and that‚Äôs it. You get the idea. Many cars do this already by emphasizing speed, or RPMs, or oil pressures, etc. on their digital displays with the click of a button. 

\- In addition to Chill/Normal/Sport/Ludicrous modes, have a purely ECO one where all but necessary functions are turned off to maximize range and efficiency. 

\- It was nice allowing us to change the color of our 3D model, but if we added assets for aftermarket taillights or other wheels, that would be cool. It could even be something others create, and we can upload via thumb drive. It‚Äôs weird to see my 3D model with the wrong wheels and taillights since I got both replaced. 

\- Why is the walk-away door lock sound the horn honking? Tesla‚Äôs have external speakers, so make it a pleasant locking sound like other EVs do and not this loud obnoxious honk. Even the reverse humming sound is more pleasant than the honk. I hate coming home at night to my apartment and having my car honk. I could turn off the walk-away door honk, but that isn‚Äôt the point. I shouldn‚Äôt have to not use a function because it sucks. That is indicative of the function itself needing fixing. 

\- Allow retrofitting for powered frunk/trunks, new center console, heated steering wheels, and other upgrades just like they are doing with the CCS adapter. In fact, my Tesla SC is installed the newer side repeaters because I asked them to. They don‚Äôt suffer from the blinkers blinding them at night and have better low-light visibility. It‚Äôs a $350 retrofit though. 

\- Tesla needs to be more open to and more responsive when allowing other auto shops to buy Tesla parts. My go-to auto guy could not get certain parts from Tesla SC no matter how many times he reached out. But when I scheduled an appointment with the SC, they magically had the parts ready to go. 

\- STOP removing functions in a car I already paid for. This is the double-edged sword of OTA updates. We get more cool features and more power, but on the flip side, we lose some functionality like radar and ultrasonics. Imagine buying a cellphone with certain functions and later the manufacturer removes some of those functions even with the necessary hardware still installed. Now imagine some of those functions were big reasons you bought the cellphone. And you have no say in rejecting these updates or risk being out of warranty. Totally unacceptable for a $50k plus car. 

\- If Tesla removes features in an update, they should refund the owner for said removed functions. Like removing Alcantara headliner on later Model 3s. Now it‚Äôs this cheap beige fabric garbage. Not ‚Äúluxury‚Äù at all. Or removing radar/ultrasonics. I paid for that hardware and functionality and dammit I want to use it. 

\- Why are some features on my state-of-the-art electric vehicle not available that are available on some other cheap cars? Ventilated seats? 360-degree vision? Lowering the sound when a phone call comes in? 

\- Need more factory paint options. 9/10 Teslas I see on the road are white and it‚Äôs so damn boring and monotonous. Wraps are expensive and don‚Äôt last forever. A full paint job is even more expensive. 

Overall, amazing car in its totality, literally revolutionary. I know all the above fixes can‚Äôt and likely won‚Äôt be changed, but you never know. Some might be hardware and software limited in some way I‚Äôm not aware of, but then again, I‚Äôm not a Tesla engineer. This is coming from purely a user experience perspective.

The app is called Replug and I have plans to release it to the App Store in the coming months. It is currently ready for a public beta and I‚Äôd appreciate anyone‚Äôs help in testing it.

Replug uses Apple Maps, so it works everywhere Apple Maps has data. In the future I will explore switching to Google Maps. There are also a few charge level options, namely departure, arrival and min/mx charge levels. I recently took a few road trips and personally I find it very useful for planning them, especially when tweaking the charge level options and seeing how my route changes.

Whether you are a current or future owner, if you are interested in trying out the beta, use this [link](https://testflight.apple.com/join/pYS3txS5) to download the app via Apple‚Äôs Testflight. As it is a beta, there are definitely bugs, so please send any feedback via the Feedback button in the app, or DM me anywhere online. Thank you so much and I hope some of you find this useful.

TeslaMotors,I want,bqjtev,I want to order a Model 3 this week. Help!,"I'm looking at a 2019 Model 3 Long Range in White.

&#x200B;

So, I'm totally sold, but I'm wavering on 2 things:

* Should I get the performance package?
* Should I get the FSD (self-driving) option?

&#x200B;

Here are my thoughts:

* I know I'll almost immediately replace the wheels and tires, so the 'better' wheels and tires for performance don't add any value.  There is almost more value for me to get the stock 18's with all season tires so I can throw them on in the winter.  I'm North of Seattle, Washington so snow is barely an issue, mostly just rain through the winter months (and I also have a 4WD truck).
* Everything on the performance is easy to replicate with aftermarket parts (springs, wheels, aluminum pedals, etc.) EXCEPT the higher top speed and acceleration.  Yes?
* I've talked to my 'local' friends who own Tesla's (but Model S) and none of them have opted for FSD, citing it is not quite ready for prime time. I can add it now for $6k or later for $8k, but I feel that when it is more 'ready' Tesla is likely to make non FSD owners a better deal, especially in light of their current burn rate and need for cash.

&#x200B;

Thanks for your feedback and advice :)

I dropped our kiddo off at school and was on the way home when a deer decided it wanted to jump out of the woods and play bumper cars. I guess luckily it hit the side of me rather than me hitting it head on. Front passenger window is shattered, front passenger door is heavily damaged, scrapes to the rear passenger door, passenger headlight is broken, passenger mirror came out of the housing. 

Car is still drivable (although not safely without a window and broken headlight) and overall I feel held up quite well. I'm definitely happy with the safety factor of the vehicle. Biggest problem is that the closest approved body shop is 3 hours away and that it will likely take a month or 2 for repairs to be complete. Meanwhile, apparently our insurance doesn't cover rental reimbursement. Fun times.

TeslaMotors,I want,ewo5kz,Announcing: teslabout open beta,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/71cp749744e41.jpg?width=3751&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9906bb3766cff32fc8f350f4e902f2a71c26f9a7

Hey Tesla fam,

Joey from teslabout here. My friend and I have been hard at work over the past 6 months creating [https://teslabout.com](https://teslabout.com). After months in closed beta, we are excited to announce the start of open beta today.

Teslabout is a modern web application for viewing live and historical metrics for your tesla(s). We enjoyed using other services such as teslafi and teslascope and they inspired us to build atop that idea to create a mobile first design. Below are some key features.

**Visually designed for all screens**

We‚Äôre a bit obsessed with our Teslas and metrics so we wanted a way to always be able to view them. Whether that means we‚Äôre at our desks in front of giant monitors or if we‚Äôre just in a restaurant making sure the car is locked, we made sure teslabout looks stunning on all screens. Here‚Äôs a gallery: [https://imgur.com/a/CF5z2Rz](https://imgur.com/a/CF5z2Rz).

**Commands**

One of the goals we had for making a mobile first application was to mostly replace the official Tesla app. We hated waking the car by simply opening the app or having to wait 30 seconds with the app open before we could turn on climate control. We have a command palette embedded in the dashboard that you can just press and go, no need to wait for the car to wake up first.

**Metrics**

We love metrics. We love them so much we couldn‚Äôt fit everything we wanted to trend on one screen. To solve this, we decided to create a fully custom trend tool that gives the user full control. You want to trend kwh consumption vs temperature? You got it. You want to trend odometer against battery max range against drive efficiency? No problem. You can even pick your own time range to trend against.

**Data importing**

Like many of you, we‚Äôve used a number of different services and wanted a way to aggregate all of our data so we could see it anytime. You can import data right from your settings dashboard.

**Trips, charges, and locations**

Driving and charging your Tesla is a huge part of its day. We track all of these with aggregated metrics for each trip and charge including efficiency, cost, and savings (vs ICE).

**International friendly**

Whether you like metrics, imperial, or something in between we‚Äôve got you covered with granular unit of measure preferences. We even have support for 15 different currencies.

**Security**

This one is a given. Nobody wants their stuff hacked. We took multitudes of steps here. You never have to give us your Tesla email and password. The tokens are all we need. If you decide to use your Tesla email and password, we never store them All sensitive data (tokens, passwords, etc.) are encrypted or (salted +) hashed before storage. All data is encrypted while in flight. 2 factor authentication. Secured user sessions to prevent session hijacking

**PWA friendly**

We don‚Äôt quite have the resources as 2 devs with full time jobs to create fully native applications but we did ensure that teslabout is PWA friendly and performs as if it were native.

It‚Äôs free to signup over at [https://teslabout.com/landing](https://teslabout.com/landing) and for those interested, we have a FAQ page here: [https://teslabout.com/faq](https://teslabout.com/faq).

We also have a paid tier ($5/mo/vehicle) for those interested in historical data or just want to support us. I took the day off from work so that I could stick around to answer any questions so ask away!

Update 1: We pushed a more relaxed password requirement.

Update 2: Made minor fixes to account registration and uom preferences. More uom fixes on the way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ewo5kz/announcing_teslabout_open_beta/,teslabout,1170.0,0.9949
TeslaMotors,I want,eq4fxt,Tesla's looking for software engineers for Cybertruck App,"Hey everyone, this is my first post here, and I'm not sure if I'm breaking any subreddit rules with this type of post, but I just wanted to share some info. I'm a senior level software engineer and was contacted today for a job opportunity with Tesla in regards to developing a mobile application for their new Cybertruck. I, unfortunately, cannot take this opportunity due to personal obligations and can't drop everything to move across the country for it at a moment's notice, but wanted to see that maybe someone on this subreddit had the qualifications and might be interested in the position. The position is for a mobile developer with experience in either iOS or Android and knowledge with React Native. Besides that, I know that the job is a contract based one with the possibility to get maybe brought on full time from what I've been told.

TeslaMotors,I want,ptiy84,"Just got a Model 3, never drove an electric car before","I ordered a Model 3 Long Range on 8/10 with red paint and a white interior. I picked it up on the 9/18. My previous car,  which I traded in, was a 2017 Mazda 3 2.5. I got into Tesla after watching so many reviews on Youtube. I also wanted a faster car since I can be immature and need to satisfy that side of me.

I live in an apartment and the garage doesn't offer charges however a  somewhat near Walmart has a WaWa with 150kwh chargers so I can shop real quick and get charged up. I also installed an outdoor 6-50R at my sister's house though the GFCI breaker is tripped every few hours (something I'll have to play with)

Accessories: I got a cheap Frunk mat on Amazon, I ordered a trunk and interior mat set from Taptes, and a month before I got the car I ordered a spoiler similar to what the 3 performance has. It was only $120 and fake carbon fibre (glossy plastic) but it went on great and looks fine. 

Problems: I was super worried about problems with the car because of all the internet chatter. The only thing I noticed were swirling marks on the trunk lid paint in one spot, like it was cleaned too much. 

 The gaps on the trunk panels and trunk lid bigger than my old car but it's consistent which I'm fine with. I also realized I never examined any new car I purchased in such detail before. I think all the news about Tesla is causing such a critical eye that problems present on all new cars to some extent are being pointed out.

Things I love:

\- Red paint - It's not maroon or bright red, it doesn't have that ""pull me sports car"" look to it. The $2000 extra cost is annoying , especially since the white multi-coat is free, but I'm happy with my decision.

\- White interior  - I can see how annoying it is to keep clean but I don't care, it's so high end looking

\- Performance - I purchased the $2000 acceleration boost when I picked it up. I was even thinking of the  ingenext module that turns it into a performance but I think this is enough. So many people have complained about the lack of exhaust note but the feeling of movement is everything to me. You push the pedal and it just explodes off the line. It's not shocking after 70mph but honestly that's probably a good thing, I don't go to drag strips or race tracks.

\- General driving - The steering is great, the car goes where you want, it feels planted to the road, as if it's on a track (rails). 

\- The stock 18inch tires look really good (with the $60 caps). I know the Aero hubcaps get you 10\~miles of range but I'm not a fan of them. I do consider this a positive because they give you the option, if they were being cheap they could have used basic steel rims under the hubcaps

\- The options available for customizing the car not just the infotainment system. You can change so much and I think Tesla is forcing other car manufactures to start upping their game.

Some stuff that's annoying:

1. On the infotainment system sometimes text is slightly greyed out but it doesn't mean ""off"", ""not selected"", or ""unavailable"".  I'm much more used to how software uses grey as an indicator of state. For example on the graphic of the car it says ""trunk"" in a light gray and below that it says ""OPEN"" in a somewhat darker gray. It makes me think ""Is the trunk disabled or is the function to open it disabled?"".
2. You can't adjust UI window sizes or minimize some parts of the UI. If you aren't self driving I'm not sure how useful the car's detection view is (the left side that shows what the car sees). I would love to full screen the map, full screen the audio, etc.
3. The navigation isn't as good as Google Maps. 
   1. You can't set a default zoom level or a preset levels based on distance of next navigation and It doesn't zoom far enough in when you are going slow or when a turn is coming up. This is annoying in cities.
   2. I can't find out how to see alternative routes. Sometimes there are easier highway routes that might take a few more minutes but are an easier drive. Google maps shows you those routes and the time for them, it even performs time updates as traffic changes.
   3. On a drive from Long Island NY to New Jersey it suggested a route through Manhattan (NYC) that has a $6.50\~ toll and heavy city traffic driving instead of an alternative where you only are in the city for a few miles on one street. The times were either the same or a few minutes more.  *For those that are curious Route 1 was LIE -> (TOLL) Midtown Tunnel -> city streets -> Holland Tunnel. Route 2 was LIE -> 278 -> Manhattan or Williamsburg bridge-> Holland Tunnel.*
4. On the app icons represent either actions, state, or description and it's not consistent. There are three types, Trunk is text and says ""open"" and ""close""  (Action). The charging port is an icon of a lightning bolt, grayed out means closed, bright means open . The door lock is a symbol that represents state, a closed lock means it's closed, open lock means it's open
5. If you are near the car (connected with bluetooth) it shouldn't warn you when you want to open the frunk. I get that if you are away from the car you should get a warning but I should be able to disable while connected with bluetooth.
6. I wish the windshield wipers were on the wheel stalk but I'm not as upset now because I didn't realize you can hit the button a little to have it operate once.
7. I'm having so much trouble getting used to the turn single stalk. The amount of force required to get past the marker for making a full turn is weird to me but I'm sure I'll get used to it.

Overall I'm so happy with my purchase, maybe I'll get a license plate that reads ""S00TLIFE""

TeslaMotors,I want,ooi0qy,"Might get blasted for this, but I think the hate against opening up the SC network is ridiculuous","Probably not a welcome opinion here, since I dont own a Tesla vehicle, only stock. But after reading through the recent threads on sharing the super charging network I'm turned away by the elitism and complaining. 

I 100 percent believe that Tesla opening the charging network is a carefully thought out decision, and not just an Elon meme.

I'll summarize for three quick reasons;

1. **Government grants** - Its fairly obvious to everyone by now that Tesla chases government money. Subsidies bring down the cost of vehicles and provided the upfront capita needed to compete against established automakers. Under the new Biden administration there is a huge fund planned to spur EV adoption, infrastructure and development, Tesla will not want to miss out on this chunk of change. Opening up the network is how Tesla proves they are contributing to the renewable vehicle infrastructure, that is how you go from pennies in subsidies, to big fat cheques to build new chargers.

2. **Charging standards are more competitive** - Tesla plug types account for the overwhelming majority in North America (around 25k last time I checked), however CCS is the standard world wide and not only is it what Tesla switched to in Europe due to regulations and consumer demand, but other standards like CHaDeMo are soon to be switched to CCS. Benefits and Cons for each standard aside, its clear the world governments want to settle on one standard, just like how you don't have to choose a different shaped nozzle when filling up your ICE vehicle, I shouldnt have to worry about what adapter to bring when charging.

3. **Its Tesla's motto, and will benefit Tesla owners and the EV industry** - Tesla has always aimed to make EVs mainstream, and that wasnt ever expected to be only through them in a monopolistic system. By sharing the network, it opens the door for other manufacturers vehicles to become more viable. It also surely forces other manufacturers to up their infrastructure rate so they dont lose their customers to charging at the nice shiny and convenient Tesla stalls (and possibly paying more to charge). I understand concerns about giving up competitive advantage, but you all need understand that this would have ended eventually. The EV market is only growing, and as more manufacturers started putting out their own chargers that all followed the CCS standard, Tesla would end up in a situation similar to the Apple lightning charger vs USB C. However in this case, it might end up worse for Tesla as they could be mandated by the government to switch to CCS without reaping any of the infrastructure fund benefits.

To close out, I get its annoying to share a crowded charging station with other non Tesla EV owners, but this kind of clanish attitude and elitism over other brands is what ends up pushing people away from Tesla. Just think about it, how would you feel if you used your adapter to charge at a non Tesla station and some dude in a Leaf rolled up and told you to f*** off?

Lets all cool off and look at this objectively, Tesla has not made this decision willy nilly, and at the end of the day they could roll it back all together and my post will look stupid.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ooi0qy/might_get_blasted_for_this_but_i_think_the_hate/,_Cubed,28939.0,0.9949

TeslaMotors,I want,9jwqsc,"Co-Worker, who owns a Maserati, was jealous of my Model 3","I have a co-worker who makes really good money. He gets a new car every year or so. Two weeks ago he found a CPO Maserati AWD with the factory warranty for $80k and pulled the trigger. 

&nbsp;

But he came into work yesterday, came to my desk and immediately asked if he could try out my Model 3 AWD. ""Sure! I mean, it's not a Maserati...""

&nbsp;

Well, five minutes later, he couldn't stop gushing about how cool it was. He was blown away by almost everything: the screen, the (lack of) noise, the acceleration, the smoothness, the glass roof, everything. And this guy has a Maserati! But his face was practically stuck with an expression of awe and excitement. He wanted to take pictures of every little detail so he could show his wife.

So, I've owned hand-me-down cars all my life. I went from a '94 Chevy Cavalier, to a manual '04 VW Beetle, to an '07 Camry, all thanks to generous family members who were getting new cars and were willing to sell their old car to me at a discount. So the Model 3 is my first, full-fledged car purchase. And I can't get over how cool it is! But, I figured most of that was because I hadn't really experienced a ""luxury"" car before the Model 3.

TeslaMotors,I want,kyrn4y,"Delivery Manager says I hold their cars to a ""high"" standard and should look at other brands","Our family purchased our first Tesla, a 2020 Model Y Performance at the end of August 2020. I think the vin is 47,xxx and paid $110 CAD in cash after taxes. I was extremely happy to purchase a Tesla after a considerable time and was wanting to purchase our first EV.

On delivery there were several issues or defects with the car to which the delivery manager had created a list and he noted it on their system through their phone. He promised all of these issues would be fixed very quickly and that I have no reason to worry since they've recorded it in their system. I would get an appointment with the body shop they work with very soon. (Pushing for their end of Q sales numbers to increase). It was not feasible for me to reject the car and potentially waiting weeks-to-a-month because my previous car was written-off from the insurance company because someone rear ended me. And the insurance company doesn't cover the cost of a rental more for than 5 days so I had been paying out of pocket for a rental over a period of a month waiting for my Tesla.

&#x200B;

Well, I've spent the last 6 months trying to get these issues fixed from delivery. The service team won't even touch the issues and says the delivery team is looking after them, which is fine since I had reported it to the delivery manager. I've had over 20 email exchanges about these delivery defects with the manager and have been asking for 6 months when would these issues be resolved for my new car. After 6 months I receive a call from the body shop saying Tesla only authorized them to fix 4 out of the 9 defects that are on the car. At this point I was considerably upset because I've spent the last 6 months of my time trying to get these issues resolved quickly only to be told a couple would be fixed. I thought this might be a simple mistake so I send 3 more emails over a period of a couple weeks to the delivery manager that had the delivery person and sales person cc'd this whole time. One month and a half goes by and not a single response from anyone, not even to say they might be on holidays and that I will receive a response soon, nothing.

When I sent a final email mentioning that the Pearl White bumpers on our car are yellowing and this is a known defect that many people have had resolved by Tesla for their white cars. I receive an email from him a month and a half later saying that the bumpers yellowing are completely normal (although not a single of my previous white BMW and cars yellowed, ever). He said I need to work with the service team (but the service team has been telling me I need to deal with the deliver team). 

Furthermore, saying that I should consider other brands that have higher quality closer to the standard that he has seen me hold their cars too. I only met him once in person on delivery day and that was when I did the walk around checklist like every other single buyer has had to do because Tesla doesn't care to have a quality control standard or team that other normal car companies do prior to the customer purchasing their cars. Then saying their cars will not hold up to the quality specifications I'm looking for in my next vehicle purchase. 

I don't understand how have I held high quality specifications and how are my standards ""high""? These are the issues I've been trying to get fixed that were noticed  on delivery day:

1. Re-attach spoiler from coming off
2. Realign tailgate
3. Paint chips on tailgate
4. Realign right rear door
5. Realign left rear door
6. Realign left rear side trim
7. Repair dent on front hood
8. Realign fender to A-Pillar
9. Replace rear diffuser due to large scratches present on delivery
10. Repaint front and rear bumpers that are yellowing (noticed after delivery)

&#x200B;

Other than these body shop issues, I have taken the car to service multiple times to fix over 30 issues that have been confirmed in my service invoices.

&#x200B;

IMO, horrible customer service and insult to injury by saying I have high standards when all I've tried to do is get these issues fixed. Clearly these issues don't even meet normal standards of a car being $110K. Yeah they have great tech and driving experience but cannot meet a normal expectation of no damages and defects on a new car, why. Could you imagine if you had to deal with this?

Apologies for the huge write up, just wanted to provide some context.

I understand the concern that I've not uploaded any proof of images, I will do so this weekend. I would like to emphasize it's not just about the car and defects.

TeslaMotors,I want,17haazu,1 month in on Tesla ownership...,"So I've been a Nissan customer for years, and when I went to lease my new Maxima, they wanted 675 a month with 1,000 down. I went to a friend that owned a Chevy dealership and the prices were not much better. As a joke, I called Tesla dealership near me and they explained I had to get the app.

48 hours later I was at the dealership picking up my new Tesla.  Never once have I drove or even sat inside the car for a ride.  Just bought it blind and showed up to pick it up.  I LOVED buying a car without slimy sales people, but was scared I made a mistake not even test driving or seeing the car I bought in advance.

Well, it's been a month and here are my thoughts:

1) In most ways, this Tesla (Model 3 base) is the coolest car I've ever had. It has more features than my previous Nissan Maxima Platinum decked out car. I love the app controls (which Nissan also charged a ton extra for and did less). It is like driving  a car of the future...I previously owned 3 different Nissan 350/370z's and this car is equally as fast as any of them.

2) Gas vs Electric.  Because of where I live (apartment) I'm forced to use supercharging stations.  There are a couple nearby which makes it easy.  I HATE the fact that it auto sets it to 80 percent charge and you have to override it manually.  I once ate some ""idle"" fees while at 80 percent which I feel is unethical as I would have been back in time if they actually charged me to 100. I know I can override it, but to make me pay more while not charging me to full is a joke. 

Also, while on this topic, I have saved zero dollars switching from gas to electric.  This is not only confirmed from my bank statements, but the Tesla App on my phone confirms that my ""savings"" are 0 dollars.  My job is only 4.7 miles away yet regardless of how careful and slow I drive, the battery always goes down at least 8 or 9 miles to get to work. Something seems defective or dishonest here...

3) Trunk.  For some reason I can not figure out how to open my trunk without going into the App.  I keep the credit card key in my wallet, but why the hell can't I just press the button on my trunk to open it when close??  Ok, this one is petty....but still annoying and I'm sure I'm doing something wrong lol.

4) Toughness:  A full grown deer rammed into the side of my car out of nowhere last week.  I mean, it full out hit me from the side and I was convinced there was a bowling ball sized crater in my passenger side door.  The Tesla camera (really awesome!) caught the deer hitting me, and the rear cam caught the deer rolling behind my car after impact.  Don't worry, I went back and the deer was fine.  Even more impressive, my car hardly had a scratch from that massive impact.  You can tell where it hit if you look close....but no serious damage at all!

I love the car and feel like I'm driving in the future.  I'm sure I'll discover even more cool tricks as time goes on.  I'm just a little bummed out about not saving more money for electric.

Also, what is the deal with no spare tire? If you get a random flat you just sit there on the side of the road until help arrives to tow your car??? Was this car built for a generation that isn't able to change a tire? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/17haazu/1_month_in_on_tesla_ownership/,CastingObsidian,278.0,0.9724
TeslaMotors,I want,8wd1ry,What I next want for AP,"If you look through my comment history, I don't find the current AP useful. I feel like Tesla sold it as a convenience feature ""we are going to have a car drive itself across the country at the end of 2017"" and in the face of slower than expected progress is re-branding it to be a ""safety"" feature with the non-flattering, but accurate, value prop that says: ""If you play driving instructor to the car, you will be safer than if you drive yourself.""

OK. Fine. But I don't need to be any safer. It's already a safe car and I'm already a safe driver. I need to be able to safely text on my cell phone, or play video games on long trips -- a thing that the current AP is demonstrably not appropriate for.

With that frame you can imagine that I'm not thrilled about the idea that my car might start seeing stop lights or traffic flow signs, because if that's what they do next then I will still be asked to be the driving instructor and won't get to sit there texting on my cell phone. I like driving the Tesla. If I have to watch the road, I'm going to drive.

I know they can't go from where they are to ""everything works"" immediately. But here's the AP feature I want next. On an expressway with a shoulder and in good weather. I want to be able to ignore the road and not touch the wheel. If the car encounters something that it does not understand, I want the car to pull over to the shoulder and stop. If it gets close to my destination and I have not taken over, I want it to pull over to the shoulder and stop. If they can only make it reliably work in the day then if it starts get dark I want the car to (you know what's coming) pull over to the shoulder and stop.  If it sees signs of coming construction, I want it to pull over to the shoulder and stop.

I don't care if it takes the right lane the whole time. I don't care if it gets stuck behind the 55mph driving little old man with a hat. If I'm typing on my computer or using my cell phone then I am happy for the drive to take longer than with me at the wheel. When *I* choose to, I can look at the car's situation and decide to pass gramps myself. 

Self driving cars are hard, but that's a really restricted circumstance with a straightforward way of handling the unexpected. That's where I'd like to see AP go next.

TeslaMotors,I want,1864wq2,"My thoughts on upgrading from a 2022 Model 3 Performance to a Model S (standard, not Plaid)","TLDR; If you are driving a Model 3 Performance, the base Model S with standard wheels is a *very* nice upgrade.

Context: I had a 2019 Model 3 Performance. Loved it. It was leased, so switched to a 2022 Model 3 Performance. The 2019 had better fit and finish than the 2022. The 2022's battery also degraded faster than the older car. I probably lucked out and got a peach 2019, but whatever. Both cars were excellent fun. That said, the crashy suspension was starting to annoy me, and I wanted more range. So got a base 2023 Model S with the standard wheels for range and comfort. Ordered Midnight Silver, it got changed to Stealth Grey.

So here are my thoughts on the differences between a Model 3 Performance and a standard Model S:

 - The Model S is much better looking (duh).
 - The fit and finish is pretty good - the panel gaps are a little wider than I would like, but I don't have any alignment issues. It is better than the Model 3 - my Model 3's trunk was slightly out of square, causing a slight jiggle when closing.
 - The initial paint quality is excellent. So was the Model 3. As to how it holds up over time, I do not know. I have PPF on the front.
 - The performance is similar. I know it is supposed to be a bit faster (same 0 to 60, but the Model S measures it without the 1 foot rollout) but the difference is too small to notice. They are both so, so fast.
 - The handling is good, but I can feel that the car is larger to drive. I have to pay a bit more attention to keep the car centered in the lane and when turning. As for actual handling, I don't drive at the limit, so both seem equally capable to me.
 - The S is *much* more comfortable! I knew that going in, but the difference is pretty stark. Now, I probably would have had better comfort if I had the standard wheels on my Model 3 rather than the larger performance wheels, but I still think the S is more comfortable.
 - The S is much quieter inside. Much less noise coming in from the outside. Overall just a nicer, more comfortable, quieter cabin.
 - Having the front instrument panel made zero difference to my life. I have no idea why auto journalists whine about needing a front IP.
 - I like the new gear selecting mechanism. The sliding up and down on the center panel is actually not bad at all. I was worried that I would hate it (I am a shorter person and worried about having to continuously reach for it) but no, works fine. Coupled with the automatic gear selection (where the car guesses the gear it should be in) it's a good solution. The *only* time I struggle is when I reverse in a parking lot, then have to reach over and move the slider up to move forward. That adds a couple hundred milliseconds to that process. On the whole I would still prefer a stalk but I feel like do get something with the new system.
 - Having the turning indicator buttons on the steering wheel is stupid, unsafe and aggravating to use. Using the buttons when you are driving straight and want to make a turn is simple. Anything else is hard to do because the buttons move with the wheels, which means you are never sure where they are. If you need to make several turns and lane changes in succession it is very disorienting and you end up clicking the wrong button or missing it entirely. The first company to offer a kit to add a turning stalk is getting my money. Honestly Tesla needs to retrofit these cars with a stalk. And bonus issue. When you are changing lanes, the signal automatically turns off after one lane change. So if you are making 2 lane changes in quick succession you *have* to use the turn signal twice. This whole thing is the single stupidest thing about this car. Comparing this to the Model 3 is moot, since the new Model 3 is getting the same garbage system.
 - The luggage space is better in the Model S. The trunk, the space under the trunk and the frunk are all larger.
 - I really like the center console - the multiple sliding mechanisms work well and help keep your stuff organized.
 - The carpets are plusher. Getting all weather mats so this really doesn't matter much to me.
 - Just overall the cabin is a nice upgrade over the Model 3 - all the materials seem a touch better.
 - Really like the rotating feature of the center screen. I have it oriented towards the driver and it does make a difference.
 - The larger screen is nice, but the Model 3 was pretty excellent in this regard as well.
 - The sound system in the Model 3 was very good, the one in the Model S is better.

TeslaMotors,I want,sxjk7n,Autopark is not only bad‚Äîit's stressful,"Consider this a ""venting"" post.

Last year I picked up a 2020 MYLR with about 2k miles, and even with the honeymoon phase behind me, it still puts a smile on my face. It had quirks and minor issues from the start; panel gaps, unrefined suspension, and shitty rim covers that literally creaked as the car moved. 

But after a few thousand miles, some of these minor issues have become regular  annoyances.

Most notably: Autopark. Especially backing into a spot.

I want *so badly* to love Autopark. I will literally go out of my way to use it, often to the far reaches of a parking lot just waiting for that light grey ""P"" to pop up. And, it does, reliably! And I get so excited to flip it into reverse and watch the car take over.

But the moment I hit the Start button, my anxiety spikes.

The first maneuver the car makes is indistinguishable from what I would do myself: Backs up, hard turn, starts getting into the lines. But the 2nd maneuver is absolutely atrocious. Even in a wide open parking lot with freshly painted lines, the car lingers for multiple seconds in place after flipping to ""Drive"" to start straightening out. So you've got half of the car obstructing traffic, while it painfully, slowly adjusts to align straight. Waiting for it to complete it's way to the final maneuver is astonishingly slow. The meandering pace makes you look like a complete jackass to the 2...3... now 4 cars you've delayed while waiting for the software to do something you do in 1/4 of the time.

It's bad enough that it makes me want to just cancel my subscription to FSD.

Elon, if you're listening:

* Autopark is way, way too slow when backing into a space, in my experience it doesn't matter how fresh the lines are or even how wide open the space around you remains
* Trying to abort autopark to make up for it's slowness as it pisses off other drivers is flat out dangerous. Instead of just allowing me to take over, the car *stops and parks* leaving several seconds of me being unable to move, get out of the way, etc... I have to sit there and wait for the shift to become available and just look like a dick to everyone around me
* The method for activating autopark is just bad UX, plain and simple. I shouldn't have to drive around slowly, staring away from the busy parking lot and waiting for the P to show up. I want to be able to signal my intent to use it *before* it's available, so I don't have to put the safety of others at risk trying to find juuuuust the right spot

TeslaMotors,I want,gqdqfd,"Test drove, ordered, and received vin all within 1 HR","Hi all,

I‚Äôve finally decided to join the Tesla family, and couldn‚Äôt be more excited!

I went and test drove, both the Model Y Performance and Model 3 Performance. I decided to go with the M3P.

After the test drive, I made an order in my car and I got a VIN right away. I have a time slot to pick up the car tomorrow.

I‚Äôm curious if anyone else was able to go through this process so quickly? It seems bizarre, as I‚Äôve read that people generally have to wait a few days at the least.

As I prepare for this I have a few questions:

- I can get full coverage from USAA and Progressive for ~$112 dollars a month. Is that a good price? What is everyone paying? (I know it‚Äôs based on various factors). The options I selected cover almost everything from PD, BI, rentals, etc...

- What clear coating should I do? Should I wait until I had the car for a bit in case I need to return it for manufacturing defects? I want to eventually wrap it with a satin/matte type of protection.

- Any other suggestions for protection?
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî


I picked the M3P over the MYP because of 5 reasons.

1. It‚Äôs new and there‚Äôs definitely manufacturing defects. I checked out 4 MYPs and every single one had issues with the panel gaps, the carbon fiber was loose or already falling off, the seats wouldn‚Äôt drop down with the push of the button, scraps on the driver door seals.

2. I personally think the car is less attractive in real life vs M3P

3. It sits higher up and I like to be low to the ground. I also want a sportier type of car.

4. I don‚Äôt have children or transport much, so space wasn‚Äôt a huge necessity for me.

5. Looking out the back window was irritating for me. I understand I can use the rear camera to supplement.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/gqdqfd/test_drove_ordered_and_received_vin_all_within_1/,Jdotsiebert,7178.0,0.7815

Please keep the posts related to the earnings in this thread.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Deliveries**

As usual, Tesla‚Äôs vehicle deliveries drive most of its earning results, since vehicle sales represent the automaker‚Äôs main revenue stream at the moment.

[Tesla already confirmed its third quarter 2018 deliveries:¬†83,500 vehicles](https://electrek.co/2018/10/02/tesla-q3-production-deliveries/)¬†‚Äì a new record for the company thanks to the Model 3 production ramp proving effective in yielding great numbers.

The delivery breakdown for the quarter was:

* 55,840 Model 3
* 14,470 Model S
* 13,190 Model X

Model 3 not only did well, but Model S and Model X deliveries were also both significantly higher quarter-over-quarter¬†(those numbers are adjusted slightly¬†during the release of the earnings).

Here are Tesla‚Äôs quarterly global deliveries of all current vehicles in production since their launches:

[https://i.imgur.com/PzkYnUl.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/PzkYnUl.jpeg)

**Revenue**

Wall Street‚Äôs revenue consensus is $5.667 billion for the quarter and¬†[Estimize](https://www.estimize.com/tsla?show_confirm=true#chart=historical), the financial estimate crowdsourcing website, predicts a significantly higher revenue of $5.993 billion.

They are both predicting an almost 100% revenue growth over the same period last year and a significant, almost $2 billion increase quarter-over-quarter.

The predictions for Tesla‚Äôs revenue over the past two years ‚Äì¬†Estimize¬†predictions in blue ‚Äì Wall Street consensus in grey ‚Äì Actual results in green:

[https://i.imgur.com/hjmN9VK.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/hjmN9VK.jpeg)

Of course, the increase is not surprising considering the record Model 3 deliveries and the still strong Model S and Model X deliveries.

Tesla‚Äôs energy division could still surprise us and make a difference, but it is unlikely to be a game-changer compared to the sheer volume of vehicle revenue.

**Earnings**

Earnings per share, or loss per share, is the big unknown this quarter.

The Wall Street consensus is a loss of $0.53 per share for the quarter, while Estimize‚Äôs¬†prediction is a loss of $0.14 per share.

Earnings per share over the last two years ‚Äì Estimize¬†predictions in blue ‚Äì Wall Street consensus in grey ‚Äì Actual results in green:

[https://i.imgur.com/dgCAsog.jpeg](https://i.imgur.com/dgCAsog.jpeg)

While the expectation is still a loss, it‚Äôs a much smaller loss than in previous quarters and the range is much bigger here. Many still expect that Tesla could announce a profit.

Around the end of the quarter, Musk did write to employees that they were close to profitability, but it hasn‚Äôt been confirmed since the end of the quarter last month.

**Other expectations for the** **shareholders letter and analyst call**

Obviously, we expect that a fair amount of the conference call and shareholders letter will revolve around Model 3 production and how it has evolved recently.

Tesla has reached its overall production goal for the quarter, but as we reported in our tracking of weekly production, the company missed its goal to have a production rate of 6,000 Model 3 vehicles per week.

Investors and analysts are going to want to have a clearer path to Tesla‚Äôs production ramp and its ultimate goal of 10,000 units per week.

With profitability in mind, we are likely to hear more about the Model 3 gross margin and how it has evolved in the past months.

Tesla had incredible growth this quarter, but investors will want to know how the company can keep growing.

The automaker‚Äôs[¬†Gigafactory 3 in China](https://electrek.co/2018/07/10/tesla-gigafactory-3-china-official-production/)¬†is expected to be a big factor in enabling growth.

As we reported earlier this week, [land grading already started at the site](https://electrek.co/2018/10/23/diy-ebike-1kw-fat-tire-snow-bike/) that they secured in Shanghai. Tesla said that they are accelerating their construction plan and I am sure investors and analysts are going to want a new timeline.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9r1iru/tesla_tsla_third_quarter_2018_results_and/,FredTesla,163135.0,0.9927

TeslaMotors,I want,ru2b87,Absolutely horrific FSD beta experience in the snow,"In the suburbs where I live it snowed around 5 inches over this weekend. I decided to take my LR AWD (with performance boost) Model 3 with FSD beta out to take a controlled look at how the beta handles some pseudo-snow-plowed roads. I've got Michelin Pilot Sport All Season 4's on it, which have better snow traction than the stock MXM4's and [generally aren't terrible in the snow even compared to winter tires](https://www.tire-reviews.com/Article/Michelin-Pilot-Sport-4S-vs-All-Season-4-vs-Michelin-X-Ice-Snow.htm).

I made sure to not activate the beta unless there were no other cars around (and kept the speed limit at -5 to -10 the limit) because the beta has been sketchy enough to me in perfect weather. **EDIT:** I *know* it is very unlikely to behave well in the snow, but I assumed it would either 1) not let me activate it at all, detecting the snow on the ground; or 2) not behave well in which case I could adequately set a baseline to compare future updates to as it (hopefully) someday learns to drive in inclement weather; or 3) pleasantly surprised me. /EDIT

Holy cow it was *bad*. I'm not going to use it in the snow again until there are more updates (and probably not even then). Here are a few obstacles I ran into where it really suffered.

1. Stop signs: The beta has a habit of driving forward until it really has to stop and then it *stops* (using the brake too most of the time. Come on one pedal driving!). It grindingly slid uncomfortably a few feet past the first stop sign before coming to a stop. Decided to not let it do that anymore.

2. Driving in a straight line (or, rather, not) when not being able to see lines: When driving down a moderate speed road (40 mph speed limit, driving 30) and being unable to clearly see the lines, the beta made some pretty crazy moves in its jerky sort of manner. It would hold a line, then jerk to the side (a movement sharp enough that it should just be an absolute no-go in snow period). It would even jerk to the *left* into what would've been oncoming traffic. I'd take over. Rinse, repeat. Normally, you follow the parts of the road that have been plowed, or keep in a straight line holding the right side of the car to the right side of the road. There should never be a need for such sudden corrections (this is a pet peeve of mine the beta does even in good weather -- it's just infinitely more dangerous in bad weather).

3. Picking a safer lane when presented with options: One part of the drive took me to a four-lane road (two in each direction) where the middle lanes had been plowed, the outer lanes had not been. I'm not even sure why the beta wanted to be in the right lane so badly (I have ""get out of the left lane"" turned off because of how sporadic it is), but it kept trying to drive me out of the plowed lane into the unplowed lane for no apparent reason (no cars around, no turn coming up, no get-out-of-left-lane).

4. Not being able to see over distances: There was a point where an ambulance was coming towards us from behind with its lights on. I opened up the camera view and there is no way the rear-view camera could see it between the snow/water on the lens, the angle, and the generally washed-out image of everything being white. I took over and pulled to the side to let the ambulance pass.

On the bright side, this excursion reminded me of how fantastically the Model 3 handles in the snow (when I was driving). I sure hope Elon is right and that Level 4 is just a year away based on interventions per mile, but I can't help but be incredibly doubtful of that, especially with this trip out into the snow.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ru2b87/absolutely_horrific_fsd_beta_experience_in_the/,flyfree256,80024.0,-0.9826

When the solar roof announcement video was released, my jaw was on the floor. Here is real, enactable change on the forefront of science, but near indistinguishable from consumer cosmetic options. Musk presented it so casually, with that shrug and a 'why wouldn't you do it.' Watching that video swelled me full of personal inspiration in a way I can't ever remember feeling before. After it ended, I'm staring at myself in the black mirror of my computer screen and I think, whoa, I want to be a part of that.

Maybe this is an unnecessary detail, but I struggle from major depression, and in a big way. Work, especially existentially rewarding work, is my most effective daily tool in treating my depression. It's rare for me to experience moments like that, where something real that *I authentically feel* shines through all the bullshit and self-loathing. It makes me want to (actually want to!) take action. I want to put solar roofs on houses. If I could be that dude, the pair of hands that hammer the nails, putting solar roofs on houses... that would be something truly worth waking up in the morning. I would get so much existential satisfaction from my sweat and energy bringing about measurable change. Honestly, for my mental health that's currently in a doldrum, I need it.

The problem is, I have exactly zero experience in any sort of related field. I have half of an architecture degree at University of Washington that I could probably go back and switch to something more specifically relevant... but what's relevant? I've been working for a Seattle-based urban sustainability startup for the last two years, and did lots of volunteering with WWOOF, here and overseas, after college. So at the very least, my resume looks environmentally-focused and not afraid of manual labor. I'm genuinely willing to start anywhere, from the bottom rung; this feels like the first time I've had an answer to what I want to be when I grow up.

Where should I start? Sweeping floors at my local Tesla dealer? Construction? Electrician trade school? Elon Musk's personal cell? I'd start the work tomorrow if I knew how.

Help! Literally any input or advice is helpful, thank you in advance.

(If there's a better place to post/ask this, please let me know. I'm mostly looking for input from people who have a close relationship with the company Tesla, which seems to come hand in hand with owning one of their products.)

When I finally got the build pushed to my car I took it for a daily commute to the gym. Here's how it went. The profile is on Assertive btw. 

Driving through the neighborhood I understand it treats it as any other road but the car travels literally in the middle of the road so I have to disable it until I get out of neighborhood.

Turning out of neighborhood the creep is so slow and when it finally decides to go after sitting for a little while with no cars coming, it's just too slow.

Here's where I was pretty impressed at the 4 way stop sign, it does really well at detected when it's turn is but again it's commitment to go is just way to slow so I find myself always on the acceleration pedal to speed it along before someone honks at me.

When entering a 2 lane left turn, it chose the one on the very left and what shocked me was it committed too hard and fast this time yanking me into the furthest lane. It then failed to correctly make the turn though.

It also failed to make the turn at the light to my gym but that turn is a bit hard because of how sharp it is.

I drive this commute every single day so I hope to see FSD grow enough to where I can actually babysit it and not intervene every second.

TeslaMotors,I want,ka99a1,Unintentionally hate my ICE vehicle after test driving a performance M3,"Tesla is my favorite company in multiple aspects. Their upbringing, mission, groundbreaking products... I just love them so much and have for a few years. 

I‚Äôm 20 years old and in college and currently drive a pickup truck that isn‚Äôt too speedy, but still can pass cars with a breeze. For the past couple of years I‚Äôve been convincing my parents to purchase a Tesla and we‚Äôve been on 2 test drives. (I was not the driver for either of these trips). 

Under GA law, for some reason I was under the impression that you had to be at least 25+ years of age to test drive a vehicle. After some curiosity, I called a local Tesla showroom and found out you only had to be 18. I shouted from the rooftops after hanging up the phone and immediately booked my test drive as soon as possible. 

A week later, after checking in for my appointment and getting settled, the employee said, ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre going to be driving the performance Model 3, I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs okay with you?‚Äù ‚ÄúAbsolutely‚Äù. I sat down in the drivers seat and was astonished even though I fully knew what to expect. Due to Covid, employees weren‚Äôt riding in the vehicle with you. Instead, they send you on your way for roughly 20 minutes to do your hearts desires. 

After driving for a few minutes and getting used to the braking system (which I absolutely loved) I approached a red light and I was the first car in line. When it turned green, I (safely) tested out the acceleration. I got a head rush, was thrown back in my seat and couldn‚Äôt hold back my laughter. I couldn‚Äôt believe how fast this machine that I was in charge of could go. I proceeded to get on the freeway and merge with no trouble at all as the acceleration gives you plenty of confidence to get in front of cars. I let autopilot take me a few miles and had it pass cars in lanes, I was smiling the entire time. Couldn‚Äôt stop myself no matter how hard I tried. I was quite literally in my version of heaven and bliss. 

After returning to the dealership and chatting with the employee a bit about the Cybertruck, Texas Gigafactory and other Tesla related topics, I left and immediately felt a sense of near sadness when I put my foot on the gas of my pickup truck. There was no instant acceleration, no sound of the futuristic engine, no regenerative braking... my brain was confused. I knew obviously that my truck would feel different, but in those 20 minutes that I got to drive the M3, I wanted to so badly be used to that feeling of driving all the time. Nothing is comparable. 

So now here I am 2 weeks later dreaming about owning a M3 or CT someday and getting that feeling back. Coincidentally I had to take my truck to the shop to fix some oil malfunction and it only fueled the fire more. Can‚Äôt wait to be a future owner, and can‚Äôt wait to get that feeling back. I‚Äôll forever reminisce on the amazing experience of driving a Tesla.

TeslaMotors,I want,8atolp,Tomorrow I'll be configuring my Model 3 and paying for all upgrades exclusively using profits from a $35k investment in $TSLA on reservation day.,"I was psyched on Friday to get a configuration email for my Model 3.  But now I'm even more pumped and wanted to share why.  
When I placed my reservation on 3/31, I took 35k in cash and put it in $TSLA, buying 150 shares at $233 each.  I decided that I'd use any profits to determine what upgrades I'd get, and if the investment ultimately lost money then I wouldn't get a Model 3. I've jumped in and out of the position numerous times over the last 2 years. But this past Friday after market close, I received a configuration invite so I decided it was time to see how well the position has performed.  I added up my total earnings on that initial 35k investment and it comes out to just over $23,000, exactly enough to get the fully loaded LR and take care of all taxes! 

I just wanted to share because in my eyes I'm basically scoring a fully loaded model 3 for the base price.  Thanks Tesla, can't wait to get behind the wheel!

TeslaMotors,I want,lu53sf,Renewing my Toyota RAV4 lease.... or how I bought a Model Y.,"Bear with me... it‚Äôs long and I need to get it out!

I have a month left in my Rav4.  My Toyota‚Äôs have been  ridiculously reliable.  The Rav isn‚Äôt anything fancy and today I went to just lease another one. I wanted the same model, keep it simple. My old neighbor is the salesman, or should have been had he not gotten Covid and is still recovering. No big deal, he will call ahead any make sure they take care of me.  Tells me to see Sam. 

I show up and ask for Sam. He hands me to someone else (strike 1). This tool never gives me his name (strike 2). I‚Äôm already fuming, I ask for the same model but want to test drive because Toyota put an electronically controlled continuous variable trans in it ( had one in a Chevy and it was horrible). I drive it... it drives like crap. He gets me a hybrid model with more bells and whistles to test, this drives really nice. I ask him how much. Come back with $598!!  It wasnt that nice!  He says ‚Äúwell my manger want to know what number is good for you‚Äù. It‚Äôs a lease!!!!  Since when do they attempt to deal on a lease!!  He starts all the typical car salesman crap (strike 3). I‚Äôm done. Tell him I‚Äôll get back to him. They offer the find the model down that‚Äôs cheaper but want $500 to do that. 

I leave. My wife knows I want a Tesla. She convinces to go look at least. 

We show up to dealer, no pressure from the get go, test drive the 3 and Y. It drives 100 times better then the Rav. He goes over everything I ask. There‚Äôs no pressure to buy, no pressure to upsell. He already convinced the kids.  I‚Äôm sold. The buying process simple the worst part is the wait, but that‚Äôs only a week. I didn‚Äôt care about color and they had a long distance Black on the way to the dealer this week. It‚Äôs now mine. 
In the end I‚Äôm paying $50 LESS then the fancy Rav4 and I‚Äôm getting more features. I didn‚Äôt get the FSD but outside of no Apple CarPlay it‚Äôs has MORE. 

So I‚Äôm think I‚Äôm going to be happy and you are still reading, thanks for listening. I needed to vent!!

This is a super low-risk design as far as Tesla goes. The cost to bring it to market is much much lower than previous vehicles and that should be a sign to the market that Tesla is maturing as a company and is able to focus on practical products that will make them money.

TeslaMotors,I want,9zwunv,Supercharging lines are battle grounds.,"WTF,  I almost literally got into a fight at a supercharger.  I was parked, waiting in line at the Fountain Valley supercharger today with 4-5 others.  When my turn came up, the next owner was getting loaded up to leave.  Right then, another Tesla drove in, waited for the car to pull out, then backed into it. 
I figured he just didn‚Äôt know there‚Äôs a line.  The guy parked next to me in line looked at me ‚Äúyeah it‚Äôs your turn‚Äù.  I said ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôll let him know‚Äù.

*Walked over and casually stood around until he got out*

Me: ‚Äúhey pardon me.  Just letting you know that there‚Äôs small line for the chargers over there.  I just happen to be next‚Äù

Me: ‚Äúyeah, it‚Äôs a full lot, so the overflow people just hang out over there and wait‚Äù

*another guy charging walks up* yeah, he‚Äôs been waiting in line before you, there‚Äôs a whole line of people‚Äù

Him: ‚Äúlook, I‚Äôm  going to be here for 5 minutes or so.  You can wait‚Äù *inserts charger in car*

Me:  ‚Äúyeah, that‚Äôs not how this works.  You‚Äôre not only cutting in-front of me, but everyone else over there. People have been waiting for a while‚Äù

Him: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you, get out of my face‚Äù *proceeds to gets in my face*

Me: ‚Äúthis is how you want to handle this?‚Äù

*3 more people waiting walk over*.  One other guy cuts into the convo ‚Äúwhat are you doing? There‚Äôs all these other cars waiting and you just blew past them‚Äù

Him: ‚Äúalright alright! Fine!‚Äù *unplugs his car, gets back in, and speeds away*

What‚Äôs crazy about all this is the people that walked over told me that they all have experienced this before to.  People cutting, arguing and almost breaking out into fights.  I know some locations have a ‚Äúvalet‚Äùperson who monitors who‚Äôs in line, but this is nasty.  It‚Äôs like charging has created a whole new problem.  Today showed me how Tesla owners are not as much a small community anymore.  We have just regular occasional assholes like BMWs.  

The valet people are just a bandaid.  With the explosion of the Model 3s, we really need a better solution.

TeslaMotors,I want,of8cip,How would a Model 3 as a work vehicle driven about 35k miles/year hold up?,"My company has provided commercial vehicles to technicians like myself for 20+ years. They paid for the car, insurance, gas, maintenance, etc. The only thing we had to do was keep it clean. The car was essentially ours that we could use for personal This is all coming to an end in August. 

Due to continuing skyrocketing fleet vehicle insurance my company is moving to a reimbursement program. Now, I don‚Äôt know all of the details yet but if the rumors are to be believed, as a technician I should be seeing somewhere in the ball park of $1200/month for vehicle compensation. 

I‚Äôve always wanted a Tesla and was thinking this may be a great opportunity to finally purchase this vehicle. I still need to dive into the details on whether or not it makes sense with respect to the distances I may travel in a days time. The most I‚Äôve driven thus far in one direction is about 170 miles. On that route there is a supercharge station so I think I‚Äôll be good. 

This reimbursement would cover monthly note, insurance, gas, and up keep. My thought is if I could get that fuel cost WAY down by having a Tesla it may make it worth the monthly note.   

Besides tires, brakes, and eventual battery replacement what other ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù is required? Would a Model 3 be a good choice for this situation?

Edit: I got some concrete numbers today. Since the beginning of the year I‚Äôve driven about 24,500 miles. I‚Äôm on pace to drive 48k miles this year. I did some crunching on a ‚Äúworse case scenario‚Äù. Driving to the office they consider personal miles. I rarely ever go into the office but let‚Äôs figure I have to do that everyday for an entire month. That‚Äôs 640 personal miles. If I also go to my parents house every weekend of that month (about the furthest I travel on weekends) that‚Äôs an additional 264 personal miles. So 130 miles on average a day is 3900 miles/month. Subtract my personal miles I can‚Äôt claim of like 900 and I‚Äôm at 3k business miles. The rumor is that technicians are getting between .26-.28 cents a mile. On the low side that‚Äôs $780/month for the miles. There‚Äôs an additional $300-$350 flat rate that we‚Äôre all getting, regardless of miles driven. So, again on the low side, $300 added to $780 is $1,080/month. 

Insurance will be about $110/month. To charge a Model 3 LR for that month for the total $3900 miles would cost me $40. I arrived at that by dividing 3900 by 325 miles and getting 12 and multiplying that by $3.28. An 82kwh battery multiplied by .04/kwh (local rate) is $3.28. 

Subtract the insurance cost and fuel cost from $1080 and I‚Äôm at $930 leftover for the vehicle itself. Again, this is all worse case scenario.

Edit #2: I went ahead and purchased a Model 3 LR but not before the delivery dates pushed to September and the prices went up. I was trying to hold off until the stuff with my company completely went through but with me having to potentially borrow a vehicle waiting for the Tesla I couldn't ask that person to let me borrow the car for 3-4 months.

TeslaMotors,I want,85ajxa,A detailed review of Model 3 from a M3 owner.,"Context: I'm currently a happy owner of an [F80 M3](https://i.imgur.com/kplaltD.jpg), and over the years I've owned a [F30 335i](https://i.imgur.com/edTsvFR.jpg) and an E92 335i. I've driven pretty much all the cars in this segment, namely the BMW 3-series, the C43 AMG, the Audi S4 and S5, and the new Alfa Romeo Giulia.

Well, today I was able to borrow [this baby](https://imgur.com/qFXj4Nq) and spent a day driving it on mountain roads, within San Francisco, and cruise it down 101. Here are my impressions. I'm going to score individual categories relative to other competitors in this class, so I won't be rating the Model 3's cost against a Civic, its luxury against a S class, or its handling against a 911.

**Drivetrain (9/10):**

Modern ICE drivetrains are quite good, especially in the premium sports sedan segment. Max torque reached at very low RPM from the new turbo engines, silky smooth shift from the ZF-8 gearboxes, and some of them even manage to sound good (i,e C43 AMG). But the Model 3 beats pretty much all competitors in these categories (ok maybe not sound), with 0-30 performance that feels as fast as my M3. Instant max torque at 0 rpm and no gear shift makes this car a performance star around town, especially in local driving. One point is deducted due to Model 3's power/torque falls off quite noticeably at around 55 mph and above. Still not slow by any means, but do lag behind some of the competitors in this segment.

**Steering (8/10):**

The Model 3 has really direct steering that's quite nicely weighted (more so than the Model S), and even has a bit of that steering feedback many modern cars with electric racks lack. The ratio is not as stupidly quick as the Alfa Romeo Giulia (maybe a good thing), but felt very comparable to my last 335i. Two point being deducted for the steering weight doesn't increase in a predicable linear fashion as you keep turning. It does get heavier as turn-in increases, but not as much as I'd liked and it doesn't provide as much confidence near the limit as the best in this class.

**Suspension/Chassis (9.5/10):**

Yep, that's an almost perfect score, and in my opinion as a sports sedan, the Model 3 is among the cream of the crop in this already sporty segment. It manages to be supple *and* sharp at the same time, and is able to offer some good feedback from the road without trying to set you up with your local chiropractor. It's obviously not as hardcore/razor sharp as my M3 (and no, it doesn't make the Giulia feel like ""wet sponge""), but it's extremely well balanced and reminds me of BMW's best days. 

Some people may find the ride a bit too ""harsh"", but I personally applaud Tesla for having the courage to make a sports sedan actually sporty, instead of just making a land yacht with good acceleration. BMW, maybe you should use some of those SUV profits to build actual ""Ultimate Driving Machines"" again.

All of this is combined with the low center of gravity from the battery pack, which resulted in probably the least amount of body roll in this segment. However it's not a perfect 10 because weight *can* be felt at higher cornering speed and it was obvious the car's tires are quite limiting factors.

**Interior Quality/Fit and Finish (5/10):**

Before I talk about anything else, I want to bring up the steering wheel, or rather how ugly it is. The [Model S](https://images.hgmsites.net/lrg/2013-tesla-model-s-4-door-sedan-steering-wheel_100466393_l.jpg) has a handsome and premium looking steering wheel, my M3 has [real aluminum trim and contrast stitching leather](https://imgur.com/a/Tkqkx), and the Audi S4 has a steering wheel that resembles [that of a racecar](http://image.superstreetonline.com/f/144382304+w+h+q80+re0+cr1+ar0+st0/2017-audi-s4-live-interior.jpg). Meanwhile the Model 3's steering wheel looks like an [afterthought](https://i.imgur.com/uzXoU7W.jpg) that Tesla engineers reluctantly put in last minute because they couldn't get Full Self Driving to work.

Interior materials were decent. The wood trim felt premium, but was marred by aluminum colored plastic around it. Most of the plastic were soft to touch and the synthetic leather felt ok as well. But this segment is extremely competitive and even [KIA](https://i.imgur.com/tISHJNh.jpg) started using top end materials everywhere. Minimalism is a design choice that's subjective, but material quality is an objective benchmark where the Model 3 is definitely falling short to the class leaders such as the [C class](http://www.mercedescla.org/forum/attachments/28929d1471300833-cla-interior-vs-c-class-mercedes-c-class-salooon-2014-door-panel-detail-frontseatdriver.co_.uk_.jpg). (Yes, every piece there are real aluminum, including the window switchers, and the speaker grills are laser drilled aluminum as well.)

I personally thought the $5000 price tag for the PUP is quite outrageous for what you get. For that money you'd be buying into [BMW Individual Program interiors] (http://cdn.bmwblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/F80-M3-Individual.jpg). In comparison the full leather interior upgrade of my M3 was a ""mere"" $2k.

On the other hand, build quality was solid and the only rattling I thought I heard turned out to be the zipper of my jacket. Much better ""feel"" than the Model S from the earlier days. Also door pockets and rear cup holders man.

**Technology/User Interface (Exclude Auto Pilot) (2/10):**

This was definitely by far the lowest point of my experience. The car was very bare bone as far as features go, with no heated steering wheel, no HUD, no surround view camera, and one of the worst sound system I've heard from this segment (seriously, mid-high range sound very flat and even distorted at higher volume). 

Then there is the center display, which was responsive and high resolution by itself. But the problem was the interface itself was a complete mess. One cannot even adjust side mirrors without drilling down into the menus while driving. Bringing up the odometer of the car was a puzzle game by itself. The passenger couldn't open the glove compartment when I was trying to setup Bluetooth with my phone. Navigation itself was fine, but the UI was dangerously unsafe since the turn-by-turn instruction was to the far right side of the screen, with small fonts on top of an alpha overlay. Coming from [what I currently have](https://i.imgur.com/vBjVrq8.jpg) it was just infuriating.

And by the way, [this happened twice](https://i.imgur.com/chrYRpQ.jpg) to me on the short drive up to San Francisco. Once it happened when I was trying to get to the menu to adjust my side mirror. Thank Elon for Auto Pilot.

Which brings us to...

**Auto Pilot (10/10):**

The best driver assist in this segment, bar none, end of story. Is it perfect? Not even close. Is it the best money currently can buy? By far. 

I would be lying if I said I didn't miss my M3 on the drive up to San Francisco. But after grabbing a late dinner with friends and I drove back on the boring 101 at night, I would be lying if I said I didn't wish my M3 had Auto Pilot.

**Overall Impression:**

I was impressed by the Model 3. It wasn't perfect, but is definitely without a doubt one of the strongest entries in the crowded luxury sports sedan segment. It does have some unique issues but it also has the unmatched value proposition of the sportiest EV on the market (yes, this car is a lot sportier than a P100D Model S). 

This may very well be my next daily driver, if there is room in the budget for it along with a [718 GTS](http://st.automobilemag.com/uploads/sites/11/2017/12/2018-Porsche-718-Cayman-GTS-front-side-in-motion-01.jpg) :)

The Model 3 is not a true sports car. It is not a real luxury car either. But for 99% of the people out there who can work an EV into their life, it is a *very, very, VERY good* car. The Model 3 is probably not *the* best car in this segment, but I also cannot say any competitor is clearly better. Tesla's first effort in this segment manages to trade blows evenly against the best.

P.S.

The 3 settings for the heated seats seemed to be...

1.	Somewhat warm.

2.	George Foreman.

TeslaMotors,I want,bmscuc,Tesla wants to put super chargers on my property,"I‚Äôve been in negotiations with Tesla at several of my hotel properties where they want to install super chargers.

The more I think about it the more I‚Äôm thinking especially since they want to install their new chargers with 15-25 min charge times that it isn‚Äôt going to drive any traffic into my business only cause congestion and me to lose parking stalls. 

So my question for Tesla owners is what do you do while you are charging at a super charger? Would you go into my hotel to eat or get a drink? 

Secondly I don‚Äôt think the super chargers will drive traffic to stay like a regular overnight charger would as you would have to go move your car rather than just plug it in and leave it overnight.

TeslaMotors,I want,2ll8ms,I took my 2nd test drive yesterday and it inspired me to write my legislators. I want sales in Texas by the time M3 is released. Sample letter inside.,"I did a search and the only letter I found was from /u/cflynn07. So I took his example and ran with it a little bit. I sent this to my recently reelected senator (who actually sponsored a bill last session) and representative, as well as the new governor-elect. I don't have high expectations, but it was worth a shot.


>
>I'm writing to voice my support of (bill), which was stalled in committee during the last legislative session. 

>This bill directly relates to sales of modern electric powered vehicles without requiring a dealer franchise. Currently, the main beneficiary of this bill is Tesla motors, however furthering this legislation would also open doors for other young companies looking to embrace modern technology. Unfortunately, the car dealer associations view this as a challenge to the long standing franchise model, and have successfully countered similar bills in other states. It is in the best public interest to alter this status quo.

>The current legislation in Texas hurts new companies such as Tesla by unfairly burdening them with a requirement to sell their vehicles through third party dealerships. Tesla has never granted a franchise license, preferring to sell directly to the consumer. This allows potential customers to order their vehicle to the specifications they desire, with direct pricing information, and without the pressure of structured dealership sales tactics. Unfortunately, this is prohibited by outdated Texas Occupations Code, and the dealerships prefer it stays this way for obvious reasons. 

>Such a measure is antithetical to the principles of the free market system as it incurs greater cost to consumers and prevents true competition. It is also possibly unconstitutional under the Dormant Interstate Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. 
Although it has not been publicly stated, I feel the lack of support in Texas had the direct consequence of Tesla deciding not to build their new battery factory in the state. The cost of this bad policy was approximately 6,500 jobs and a $500 million capital investment. For a state that prides itself in luring big business, this was a monumental loss. 

>Not to mention the losses incurred by current Tesla customers ordering online, then financing and having the vehicle titled and shipped via California. Why are we not capturing that revenue directly?

>I realize the impact of a small builder of luxury $100,000 vehicles is not going to make a huge difference overall. But within 2 years, Tesla is planning on mass producing an affordable electric car in the $30,000-$40,000 price range. Judging by the interest already in place, this could be the impetus needed to bring fully electric vehicles to the masses. If Texas gets left behind in this revolution, it would be a great disservice to the citizens. 

>Tesla and other aspirational companies deserve the full support of our state. It makes sense ethically, financially, and environmentally. Please do not allow the auto dealer and petroleum lobbies to destroy great innovation. Please revisit this legislation during the upcoming session. 

>Thank you for your consideration.

TeslaMotors,I want,dhlmxv,"I am researching a Powerwall, and I am confused about the impact of rebates and ability to use as we want to. (California)","Ideally, the best person to respond would be someone who has a Powerwall in California, who claimed the federal and state incentives to fund their energy project. But if anyone else is familiar with the matter, please feel free to comment.

&#x200B;

I am trying to convince my parents to get a Powerwall for our home, and I'm trying to do the math to see if we can afford it. They are opposed to loans, but I did tell them I'd loan them a few thousand until they could pay it back, they're opposed to that too, but I'm sure I could convince them. Their budget is $3,000. (Could be $6,000 with my personal loan). Here's two things that alone would make this affordable: The federal ITC rebate (Currently 30%, likely 26% when/if we had the Powerwall installed), and the California SGIP rebate that can be used for energy storage.

Our cooking, heating, and clothes dryer are natural gas, so they don't put a lot of load on electricity usage, which also means our energy usage is fairly consistent and predictable.

My PG&E off peak rates are from 12AM to 3PM ($0.16), peak is 4-9PM($0.47), and the other 4 hours are $0.36) Our winter peak is $0.34, but our solar outputs more in the summer, so average rates per kWh in total are similar throughout the year. If we can get the SGIP and ITC incentives, then I am almost certain we could afford this project.

What I have figured out is that one Powerwall should be enough to run the basics in our house for a day, such as food storage, some lights, water pump, and cooking/heating (Since they use natural gas for fuel), especially when paired with our solar, which might let us go for a few days if we are very conservative with energy use and the weather is good. More than enough. There's also the potential ability to save us money on our electric bill. If I charged it during off peak hours, it'd cost about $2 to charge, but save me $6 in peak rates if I used it then. This only works if I can charge my powerwall from the grid, but when I was reading about the rebates, people were saying you don't have this type of control over your powerwall if you want to qualify for the incentives.

* Is it true that in order to qualify for ITC and/or SGIP, that you don't have full control over the powerwall to save you the most money from charging at off peak and using during peak?

Here are my questions for my calculations:

* Does the federal ITC rebate cover just the powerwall itself? Or the total cost? Such as other equipment, installation costs, permits, and taxes too? I tried googling that, and some sites say the ITC covers ""total cost"" but I don't know what 'total cost' means. Everything? Or just total equipment cost?
* The California rebate is what I'm very confused about. From what I've read, Tesla maxed out the rebate, and I must go through a 3rd party in order to qualify. But when looking into that, I've seen many people say 3rd party installers that do qualify for these rebates often mislead customers by including the value of the rebate in the quote, or they claim it. I'm not sure about the truthfulness of these claims, so I'd love to see if anyone has first hand experience with the SGIP with Tesla (if that's even possible anymore) or a 3rd party.

TeslaMotors,I want,c2165b,I haven't been this guy...,"My brother is the one who has gotten excited about cars, not me. He has bought cars, traded in cars, memorized car stats, kept up with new features and models and trims and etc. I've always been slightly bemused, and thought that it has cost him some money over the years.

For a long while now I've tended to buy a new car and drive it for longer than is average in the US. My current car is an 03 Camry, 224k, manual shift, runs great, I've made two repairs on it in 15 years, plus normal maintenance of course.

Last Friday a Tesla turned into the parking lot at work ahead of me. I've always been interested in Teslas, so I took the opportunity to ask the driver where he took it for repairs. It was only then that I thought through how many things we fix on normal cars that a Tesla just doesn't have -- oil and its attendant pans and gaskets, fuel systems, injectors, pistons, engine cooling systems, exhaust systems, catalytic converters...

So now I was more interested. And there is a service center near enough to me, I had not realized how much not knowing that was holding me back inquiring about one. So I called the sales center, and could get a test drive of a 3 and an S at lunch -- about all I knew about them was that one was more expensive.

Well, practically anyone on this forum can guess how I was after the test drives...

My wife was out of town, but supportive when I talked with her. I dithered and worried and etc., and finally decided that I really wasn't that guy, my Camry is running fine, why was I even thinking about this?

But my daughter, my brother, my aunt, my nephew, and the husband of my first-cousin-once-removed (M3 owner) were all excited about me buying a Tesla. ""Go for it!"", I heard from all of them. My wife wasn't quite in the go for it category, but if I wanted one was freely willing for us to buy one.

I dithered some more, and probably got helped by the tax credit expiring at the end of the month, and ordered an LR 3, full auto-driving, on Sunday. If it is really uncomfortable for my wife to sit in, we'll have to reconsider, we're checking that out tomorrow.

But I'm still left wondering, how did this happen to me? I haven't been this guy. Here I am reading the owner's manual, planning how to install charging equipment at home, contemplating driving for the fun of it, where did that COME from?

I may have an answer -- after describing some of the auto driving controls to some friends (they asked, honestly!), I realized that, looked at in one way, this is a computer in a big box on wheels.

Please keep the posts related to the earnings in this thread

____________

**Deliveries**

As usual, Tesla‚Äôs deliveries drive most of its earning results since vehicle sales represent the automaker‚Äôs main revenue stream at the moment.

Tesla already confirmed its first quarter 2018 deliveries: 29,980 vehicles ‚Äì a new record for the company thanks to the Model 3 production ramp starting to produce decent numbers.

They ended up delivering 11,730 Model S vehicles, 10,070 Model X vehicles, and 8,180 Model 3 vehicles.

Those numbers are adjusted slightly during the release of the earnings.

Additionally, 4,060 Model S and X vehicles and 2,040 Model 3 vehicles were in transit to customers at the end of the quarter, according to the company.

Here are Tesla quarterly global deliveries of all current vehicles in production since their launches:

https://i.imgur.com/B4zIyXi.jpeg

**Revenue**

Wall Street‚Äôs revenue consensus is $3.142 billion for the quarter and Estimize, the financial estimate crowdsourcing website, predicts almost the same result: $3.233 billion in revenue.

They predict a slight drop from the $3.288 billion that Tesla brought in during the previous quarter, but it‚Äôs a significant increase over the $2.696 billion that they brought over the same period last year (Q1 2017).

The predictions for Tesla‚Äôs revenue over the past 2 years ‚Äì Estimize predictions in blue ‚Äì Wall Street consensus in grey ‚Äì Actual results in green:

https://i.imgur.com/A74EOvz.jpeg

Even though Tesla delivered slightly more vehicles this quarter than ever before ‚Äì including more than during the last quarter, which was a record quarter for revenue for Tesla, revenue are expected to be down because Model S and Model X deliveries are down and the record deliveries was due to Model 3, which is less expensive.

Tesla‚Äôs energy division could still surprise and make a difference, but it remains to be seen.

**Earnings**

Earnings per share, or rather loss per share, is expected to plunge again for the quarter.

Like for revenue, the expectations are again close for both the street and retail investors. The Wall Street consensus is a loss of $3.26 per share for the quarter, while Estimize‚Äôs prediction is a loss $3.19 per share.

Earnings per share over the last 2 years ‚Äì Estimize predictions in blue ‚Äì Wall Street consensus in grey ‚Äì Actual results in green:

https://i.imgur.com/6O0vBvI.jpeg

Tesla has invested for the production of 5,000 Model 3s per week and every time it doesn‚Äôt reach that, it is going to take a hard hit for the earnings.

The situation improved a lot over the last quarter, but the company is still behind its goal and therefore, the prediction is still of a significant loss for the first quarter 2018.

**Other expectations for the shareholders letter and analyst call**

Obviously, we expect that a fair amount of the conference call and shareholders letter to revolve around Model 3 production and how it has evolved recently.

But we already got a pretty good update from when we obtain an email from Elon Musk to employees two weeks ago.

With this said, investors and Model 3 reservation holders would certainly appreciate another update ‚Äì especially about the results of the production line update that happened during the production shutdown.

Tesla did upgrades with the goal to end the second quarter at 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week and that goal will likely be an important part of the earnings and conference call.

It is linked with the Model 3 vehicle program becoming profitable and Musk now says that he expects Tesla to be profitable in Q3 and Q4.

Those expectations are directly linked to Tesla achieving the Model 3 production goals and therefore, investors will be looking at some reassurance that Tesla can achieve the production rate.

A few other interesting points that I expect Tesla will address include, plans for production in China now that the door appears to be open, timing on Model Y since news came out that Tesla was aiming for a start of production in November 2019, and even though the company and Musk directly addressed it a few times recently, I expect analysts will want more details about Tesla‚Äôs plan not to raise capital this year.

As for Tesla Energy news, I expect that solar deployment will still be slow, but it should be an interesting quarter on the energy storage front. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it ends up being a record quarter.

* 3rd Party App Support: Apple recently allowed more types of apps to integrate with CarPlay, including Parking and Food Ordering Apps.  Apple already allows audio and messaging apps as well. This means I can use WhatsApp, Overcast, Audible, Spotify, and much more, without having to touch my phone. Soon, Starbucks will probably be added to that list. You can also use other navigation apps like Waze, that provide features Tesla does not, like police warnings. Even \*if\* Tesla allows 3rd Party apps, if you are a developer, it won't be worth having resources allocated to Tesla's proprietary system when CarPlay and Android Auto cover 99% of cars.
* 1st Party Phone Integration: With CarPlay and Android Auto, your phone integrates completely. Siri and Google Assistant work quickly, and can actually show you things instead of relying on audio only. You can run Siri Shortcuts. Things like Calendar appointments and iOS location sharing all work from CarPlay. Tesla will never be able to have this level of integration.

CarPlay doesn't need to take over the whole screen- many manufactures have CarPlay and their own system coexist. Nearly every manufacturer has caved an added it. From the most luxurious brands, to the most economical, CarPlay and Android Auto are becoming [ubiquitous](https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/available-models/). I think Tesla's [NIH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here) Behavior can't last forever.

Edit: To all those saying they hate CarPlay and AA, and they don‚Äôt want it... well what about making it an option, like BMW or Mercedes? Implementing the API would be relatively simple for a company Tesla‚Äôs size.

TeslaMotors,I want,557r3l,"I dont just want a tesla, I also DONT want a non tesla car.","To explain what I mean, about 2 years ago, I bought my first car, A Honda civic, 2007 4 door. I was weary of buying from someone off craigslist, so i thought ""better buy off a dealer. I know its more expensive, but I wanna make sure the car is in good shape."" I check out the car, and it starts and looks cool in the dark blue, so i think ""yup, its a car, must be good, ill take it."" Less than 500km of driving the engine light goes off. I bring it in and discover that the oil is out, the transmission fluid is BLACK! like dirty oil black, the tires are nearly flat (yes I know im a nieve idiot and they probably saw this too). The brakes were nearly gone too. I told the dealer, they didnt really care. This wasnt some corner side dealer either. It was a large Honda dealership. 

On top of that, on my next service i found out that the previous service never replaced my filters even though they charged me for it.

To make a long story short, dealers rip you off and it is beneficial for them to lie to you. Tesla does not and has no reason. So Ill never buy an ICE car again from any dealer, and now want and will have a tesla.

I share this because I hear of so many states wanting tesla to use dealers, but they seem to be ignorant to the fact that maybe people dont want to use a dealer because alot of them are snakes.

Efficiency and automation are great, but they do have an interesting side effect ... the money leaves the community.  Our wealth is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few. Jeff Bezos is the fifth wealthiest person on the planet, but he doesn't spend any of his money in my town. Neither does the Walton family. And neither does Elon Musk.  

Increasingly, tech companies have been giving higher priority to their responsibilities to shareholders than to the communities they do business in.  Increasingly, retail workers are part timers who have no employee benefits.  Many companies have engaged in some questionable practices like re-domiciling in Ireland (Accenture, Analog Devices, Amazon.com, Apple Inc., Airbnb, Baltimore Technologies... ) and dubious revenue and expense recognition practices to ""minimize their tax liability.""   Communities compete to provide tax relief to employers ... but that simply shifts the cost of roads, schools, and public safety onto the employees.

TeslaMotors,I want,9cdhgy,"50 days fully paid, still no delivery: A Texas Story","You may have seen me complaining around the sub here and there, but I wanted to lay out my full story today on day 50. Here's my timeline:

Reserved July 2017

Configured (RWD, Aero, EAP, White) **June 27, 2018**

Paid in full on **July 13th**

Delivery date scheduled for **August 4th**

Delivery delayed to **August 11th**

Delivery delayed to **August 17th**

Delivery delayed to **August 23rd**

Delivery delayed to **""August - October""**

That is, as of today my Model 3 has been 100% paid off for 50 days. I do not have my car, I do not have a delivery date, and my *second* loan payment will be paid today. The service and communication I have experienced from Tesla has been remarkably poor. 

My IDA seems utterly asleep at the wheel (no pun intended). In the space of my 4 delivery delays, I have taken days off work and pushed back vacation plans to accommodate, but was never once even contacted to let me know my car was not going to be there for delivery. All I have ever been told since my initial delivery date of August 4th is that ""your car is in Oklahoma."" Once I was told ""Your Model 3‚Äôs battery was not charged. This is the reason for the delay."" On the rare occasions my IDA does get back to me, she acts as if it's the first time she has heard of my situation. It's the most frustrating and disappointing purchase experience I've ever had. I know a number of other Austin residents who have ordered, paid for, and received their vehicle in the time of just my delays. One can't help but feel singled out.

Perhaps the most frustrating part of this process has been the inability to escalate my issue. Requests to my IDA, hour-long phone calls with Tesla support, and numerous emails have resulted in nothing. I've even sussed out the email addresses of a number of higher-ups in the Texas delivery division, but nobody ever gets back to me. 

I have no doubt that this will all be but a distant dream once I do get my car, but for now it has just been a shit-ass experience. Thank you for indulging my complaining.

Evacuation traffic - Charge is amazing - it will go for days in stop and go traffic.  We usually make it to the supercharger with ~7% left after going 80 the whole way.  After 4 hours of traffic we made it with 30%

Supercharging - no lines at all, probably an advantage that I am in the deep south where people still think that it is a gimmick so we don't have many Teslas about.

I came back to the city early with it and brought gas and generators for people.  I have a trailer hitch carrier and I know there are pictures of me going around as a meme.  But because I had basically unlimited energy with a supercharger online 10 miles away, I had no issues driving around and giving out gas and generators and wasn't wasting gas to do it.

9000w Gas generator will charge the tesla without issues.  I tried it and it worked only because I wanted to know.  Didn't actually need to charge it with a generator.

TeslaMotors,better,gysero,4 things my BMW 5 series did better than my M3P...,"So I've officially completed just over a month with my M3P and I'm in love. As a daily commuter, it's just brilliant. Simple, comfortable, and very satisfying to drive.

With that said, there are a few things that seem glaringly inferior when compared to my previous experience with BMW. Full disclosure: I'm a car fanatic, and pledge loyalty to no brand. I love cars for what they are and rotate through new cars every 12-16 months or so because I love to try new things. There's no hate to Tesla here, just some observations on what I think could be easily improved via software.

**1. Deactivating the car alarm is an utter FAIL.**

So using your mobile phone (iPhone 11 Pro here) as the car's key is brilliant. While it isn't perfect and can take a moment to connect via Bluetooth when approaching the car sometimes, it's mostly pretty flawless. I really enjoy the experience. It's something I love, *except* when the alarm unintentionally goes off.

One really poor example is when I went into a restaurant to grab take-out while my wife and 2 young daughters stayed in the car. I set HVAC to stay on and brought my phone in with me for mobile payments. As I was returning to my car my wife opened the passenger door to grab the food from me. But because my phone hadn't connected via Bluetooth yet, her opening the door triggered the alarm by opening the door from within.

This immediately triggered the alarm. 

If you haven't experienced the alarm, here's a quick synopsis of what its like. It's ALARMING ;)

Now imagine what it's like being inside the car still.

Heavy metal Bach music is blaring at 5000% volume, and there is NO obvious way to minimize the volume (due to lack of volume knob like a traditional car). I mean I get that it makes sense to add it because its the alarm, but seriously, it was dangerously loud for an adult, let alone a very young child inside the car.

Of course, anyone standing in front of their car is going to feel befuddled as they grope around their pockets for their key to disable the alarm only to remember that your phone is your key. Now you have to grab your phone, unlock it, open the Tesla app, and then ""unlock"" your car, all while your occupants are having their eardrums melted by the ""modern"" theft-deterrent system blasting heavy metal at 5000% volume. A ""traditional"" car could be deactivated by jamming a button on your key fob while the keys are still in your pocket. As a first-time Tesla phone-key alarm deactivator, there was simply NO warning or preparation for this kind of experience. Totally not cool. 

This seems like a glaring oversight. Not only was it an embarrassing experience for me and my family, but also any bystander who doesn't appreciate Teslas would be watching as music is blasting and thinking ""why the heck would I want my car to do that?"" Worse though, what if there was an infant in their car seat while my wife was also in the car? That could cause literal physical damage to a very young baby and there is NO apparent way to turn off any alarm quickly.

Serious fail. C'mon Elon.

* There has to be a better way to deactivate the alarm, or, proactively determine what sets off an alarm. For the latter, why can't it use the seat sensors to sense whether someone is in the car? Or the internal camera? Or use the HVAC setting to leave it ""On"" when I leave the car (or combination of both) to predict that someone may still be in the car. Or best yet, once the phone has connected via Bluetooth, deactivate the alarm. Or a push notification on my phone pops up to deactivate quickly. Finally, a deactivation method to type in a 4-digit pin on the screen would have been VERY helpful in this situation. But without any warning, the pin may not have been super obvious.

While I love the Model 3s minimalism and simplicity, there doesn't seem to be enough oversight on this functionality and how one would want disarm false alarms. It made me embarrassed to own a Tesla to say the least, and the 5 people watching us nearby were probably assuming that Tesla drivers love blasting annoying music and pissing everyone off around them.

**2. Remind the driver that they left their phone in the wireless charging tray.**

It's only been a month, but I've left my phone in the charging tray at least a dozen times now after leaving the car. Since I use the phone as my key, this is kind of a problem. My (18+) BMW M5 would notify me on the dash, and with an audible signal, that a phone is in the charging tray whenever I put it into park and opened the driver's door.

Considering that the UI notifies me when I'm closing the center console too hard (and it not sticking), I think this is a simple request.

* PLEASE, can you just set up a UI reminder that I have a phone to grab, especially because it is THE KEY? You could even make it a toggle in case people don't like it.

**3. Tesla is known for its automated (or semi-automated) driving capabilities, but my BMW was superior in two simple ways.**

When activated on the freeway, my BMW seemed far more ""simple"" in its semi-automated driving. 

First, the steering wheel resistance amount required on my M3P to not trigger a ""warning, hands on the wheel"" seems far too little on the M3P. I'll have my hands on the wheel and it won't detect them. While that is kind of annoying, it gets worse when you apply some resistance and accidentally kick it out of autopilot.

Second, the more frustrating part, is that once you ""kick it out of autopilot"", you have to manually reactivate it. My BMW would automatically turn back on once you put your hands on the wheel, and, even after changing lanes. It would stay on completely until you turned it off. 

When I change lanes in the M3P, it deactivates autopilot and then you have to turn it back on. It gets old after about 3 times of doing this and then you just don't want to use the feature anymore because of how annoying it is.

* Allow Autopilot to turn back on after a lane change. I don't want to have to think about Autopilot again when I feel the need to take over the car temporarily. 

Thirdly, the reactivity of the active cruise control to decelerate when approaching a car in front seems far more excessive than the BMW did. It will decelerate in a much more extreme way and is quite jarring in some instances. This would require a more refined sensitivity level, but, just my opinion on this last one.

**4. Allow users to adjust the lower UI controls.**

I think the UI in the M3 is far superior than the MS I drove in 2018. The always-on controls on the bottom of the screen are helpful, but I would LOVE the ability to customize them.

Two things I will likely never use in AZ: the front or rear defroster, and the seat heaters. That takes up valuable UI space for something I would rather have: 1) rear HVAC on/off, 2) Fan speed (non auto mode), 3) other.

For #1, since I live in AZ, the AC will be used basically ever day for 9 months. I would love a quick toggle to turn the rear AC on and off. Sometimes I have the kiddos with me, sometimes I don't. Right now I leave it always on so I don't have to mess with it, but obviously that uses more energy than needed. This would be quite welcome.

For #2, when in auto mode, the fan speeds adjust based on the thermostat setting. But if you don't want it in auto, then you have to enter the additional HVAC menu and make adjustments there. I'd love to manually control fan speed from the lower permanent UI than having to go into a menu.

For #3, I love seeing the energy consumption graph. Not a deal breaker that it takes 2 taps to get there, but I'll never use the heated seats or front/rear defroster icons. I don't need those taking up 20% of icon space, especially when I accidentally turn on the heated seat when reaching for the HVAC temp control.

* Suggestion: allow users to edit the lower UI icons. Take a play from Apple (or any other smartphone) and allow your main buttons to be customizable. The Macbook's Touch Bar is completely customizable and has a very intuitive interface to do so.

# **The process**

* The [Bill still has to become a law, and it has a long way to go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgVKvqTItto)
* BBB now heads to the Senate, which had written a different version previously. It'll certainly undergo changes, especially with [Manchin opposing the union portion of the credit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/qruv7i/manchin_objects_to_tax_credit_for_unionmade_evs/)
* The Senate will make their own changes after the [Thanksgiving break](https://bgrdc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/2021-Combined-Congressional-Calendar-BGR.pdf) (They get back November 29th)
* The Senate also needs to deal with the National Defense Authorization Act, which may take weeks. 
* Democratic leaders hope to get the bill through the Senate, back to the House, and sent to Biden to sign by the end of the year.


# **New EVs**

* The car must be acquired on Jan 1, 2022 or later (Delivery Date)
* The tax credit is refundable this time
* Tax credit amount - $7500-8000 for Tesla:
  * $4000 base credit
  * $3500 for vehicles before 2027
  * $500 for US made batteries
  * $4500 for union assembly (not Tesla)
* A cap of 1 vehicle **per taxpayer** per taxable year
* Income caps - The lowest income (MAGI) of the current tax year or previous year can be used:

  * **Vans**: $80k
  * **SUVs**: $80k (Model Y)
  * **Trucks**: $80k
  * **Other/Sedans**:  $55k (Model 3)
  * They will utilize criteria similar to that employed by the EPA and the DoE to determine class of vehicles. The Model Y is currently listed as a ""Small Sport Utility Vehicle 4WD"" on the EPA's site, so it'll likely fall under the SUV price cap.
 * The credit can be at the point of sale starting in 2023, but only a tax credit for 2022
 * There are no manufacturer caps this time, it just ends on December 31, 2031


# **Used EVs**

  * **Joint / Married**: $150k
  * **Head of household**: $112.5k   
  * **Single**: $75k
  * The credit phases out by $200 for every $1,000 above the income cap
 * The credit may be a point of sale credit
 * The used car credit must be the first transfer (after the bill is signed) of the car other than the original purchase 

# **Misc**

* The Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit was extended until 2031, with the cap raised from $1k to $3k. This covers 30% of the cost of an EV charger and installation
* The Energy credit (solar panels) was extended at 30% through 2031.

TeslaMotors,better,s8ya33,FSD Beta 10.9 Write up - Significantly better,"2017 Model X 100D w/ AP 2.5 cameras

FSD Beta's profile was set to ""Average""

This was a Costco run, which I've done a write up before, which can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/qizw8l/fsd_beta_1031_drive_write_up/.

TL;DR: Two drives, one to get to Costco and one to come back.  Zero disengagements on the way to Costco, one disengagement coming home.  No significant complaints from the wife regarding the vehicle's behavior.  *Significant improvement*

[This was the route taken to get to Costco](https://imgur.com/fcLTaBH)

There were zero disengagements.

There were some incidences of note, however.

[At this spot here](https://imgur.com/esa7ykB) I manually changed lanes from the right lane to the left lane, and manually back again, as there were vehicles pulled over at the side of the road.  They weren't on the road, and would not have been in the path of the car, however, Florida law is ""Move over for pulled over"" or something like that.

[This intersection here](https://imgur.com/TyGLDsH), historically, has never worked as desired.  Normally the Tesla fails to see the turn lane in time, and the result is that it just keeps flying forward.  This time it *did* get into the turn lane, but there was a *hard* braking in the process.  When leaving the intersection and turning left the car accelerated hard into the car ahead of us, which was weird, but it maintained the safety distances.

[This intersection here](https://imgur.com/RofL6WG) has also been problematic, mainly because the car seems to time the vehicles wrong.  I had to press the accelerator for the car to go forward through the intersection.  *I think* the issue stems from not seeing turn signals in use.  This intersection is super prone to getting backed up, but more often than not the people at the stop sign are always going straight.  So while the car in front of me ""got there first"" we were both crossing the intersection and not turning into each others paths.  I think the Tesla was waiting for them to ""take their turn"", when from an efficiency standpoint we can both go since neither of us are turning.

The [next intersection](https://imgur.com/k88HPta) I was actually really impressed by.  In my previous write up for 10.3.1 I drew this diagram [here](https://imgur.com/cOwxgT6) to explain my issues, and honestly, they were addressed.  The issue with the intersection is that, technically, Costco *is* a right turn up the road, however, if you get into the right most left turn lane, then you get stopped by any car making a right as they turn.  The *smart* thing to do is to be in the left most left turn lane and then just go by.  And the car did it.  The navigation also basically told it not to take the first right to get to Costco either, it took the back entrance, as I would do.

It did basically choke on the last right turn into the Costco parking lot, but from my stand point it from me from driveway to parking lot entry, and as far as I'm concerned, that was zero disengagements, and beautifully done.

So the trip from home to Costco was near perfect, and zero disengagements.

The trip home used [this route here](https://imgur.com/lEDgXhx), which is *very* similar, but turns down a couple different roads.

Leaving Costco was manual.  I did the maneuver indicated [in this diagram](https://imgur.com/UWinLbV), the red arow was manual driving, and I kicked on Autopilot at the yellow arrow.

*Historically*, when I get to the [next intersection](https://imgur.com/hoio4Ko) the car chokes, because the lane markings are faded, and it starts to drift from the right lane to the left lane in the middle of the turn.  It did not do that this time.  It maintained its lane with no issues.

A manual lane change was needed at [this intersection](https://imgur.com/cmz3Xtk), mainly because the car wants to go straight in the turn lane.  This has been that way since 10.2.  Not a huge issue, and no disengagement was necessary.

[This intersection here](https://imgur.com/gm6YBUZ) is where the the single disengagement occurred.  Traffic for the light was backed up to the yellow line.  The car became impatient and tried to get into the left turn lane.  I can understand the error, there's no lane markings to denote that the left lane is ""turn only"" that far back.  The wheel jerked hard to the left and because I had my hand on it, it disengaged.  Once we got moving again I re-engaged it and we kept going.

[This intersection here](https://imgur.com/kO9GSoz) almost got us T-boned.  The car had to make a left turn, and there was a car blocking out sight line where the yellow line is.  The green line indicates where the car that was coming toward us was.  My visibility was blocked due to the car indicated by the yellow line.  Had I been driving I would've crawled by way through the intersection until I could confirm no one was coming.  We got through the intersection fine, but I'm fairly positive the oncoming car had to tap their brakes a bit.  It wasn't close, plenty of distance and such, but this is also where my wife fussed at me the most about the car's driving.

[This intersection here](https://imgur.com/s3myf5x) was *almost* perfect.  *In my opinion* a stop is not necessary.  We were going through the intersection while the light was red, and the vehicle came to a complete stop at the yellow line.  I believe stopping here is not necessary because a new lane starts here.  Once you complete this turn, you're in a lane of your own, and no one should be in it.  Doesn't mean you take the turn at 50mph or something, but coming to a complete stop is unnecessary, in my opinion.  Ultimately I hit the accelerator and got it going again.

Approaching [this intersection](https://imgur.com/4Kju2fd) was another manual lane change.  The car hasn't been able to do it properly, at least not according to my time frame.  The issue here is that three lanes cross the intersection, but the right most lane ends right after you cross.  *Typically* what happens is that you cross and you almost come to a complete stop from people turning into the gas station, or going to Burger King.  It's easier to get into one of the left two lanes, ideally the left most one, as you cross the intersection to avoid that crap.  I manually made that lane change.

Further on down the road, at [this intersection](https://imgur.com/m5mTrNf) the car slammed the brakes at the white line as a vehicle turned out of the gas station into the adjacent lane.  Ultimately the vehicle was being over protective because the SUV that was leaving was making a wide turn out of there.  I can understand, it was dark, better to be safe than sorry.  Was a little hard though.

*Historically*, when the vehicle made a left turn at [this intersection](https://imgur.com/tkx69aC) it would choke around where the blue line is.  *Every time*, I assume it has been because there's cars trying to make a right turn to get onto the same road and they stop where the orange line is, but this time the car handled it *perfectly*.  No stops, no brakes, just a smooth left turn.

Now, for one of the last turns.  [This spot here](https://imgur.com/a3LyXqG), I've brought this up in most of my write ups because, ever since 10.2 is has been failing here and required an intervention.  The car needs to make a right turn, however, *historically* it's tried to make the right turn too early, and go into the strip mall.  Ever since 10.2 to I've always had to intervene and stop it.  This time, it got through.  I kept an eye on the FSD Beta's blue intention line and I saw it try to make a right turn, then correct itself.  The car did, briefly, try to make a right turn there, but after a moment it was like ""No wait, not there"".  No intervention was necessary, though it does still need to be cleaned up a bit.

From there it was straight home, all the way to my drive way, no interventions.

So, compared to previous iterations of FSD Beta, 10.9 is a huge leap ahead.  This is the first time I've done this kind of trip with zero disengagements in one direction, and only one coming back.

Going to be interesting to see what v11 yields next month.  Even my wife was impressed when we got home.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/s8ya33/fsd_beta_109_write_up_significantly_better/,Nakatomi2010,260413.0,0.93
TeslaMotors,better,l8q4vj,"As an owner, I don't see how any owner can think Level 5 is anywhere close","Got my Model 3 in December. Paid for FSD and I don't regret it (yet). I love the car, better than anything I've driven in recent memory. Like the center screen, like the driving dynamics. Even like watching Netflix while waiting at the supercharger.

I was motivated to post this because the design of the new Model S/X seems to clearly indicate they don't actually think you'll need the steering wheel most of the time. That seems really really premature.

The existing Autopilot is not great, and I'm even starting to avoid using it out of fear of unexpected behavior. The FSD videos show similar behavior, even more unrefined, and applied in even more scenarios. Projecting forward, it's not getting better at a rate that will reach Level 5 anytime soon. At least 5 to 10 years I'd guess. ""FSD"" might get us to Level 3 if we're really lucky.

Problems:

- Phantom braking. So much of it. I drive mainly at night these days, and it now happens about once, sometimes twice every 20-40 minute drive. In the same very general section of highway, but not related to specific cars, bridges, or trucks as far as I can see. Could be any of those, or none, in some cases. Slamming on the brakes at 120 km/h in traffic is not great.
- Had it disengage mid off-ramp a few times and I had to grab the wheel to keep from slamming into a concrete barrier.
- It seems to deliberately and sometimes dramatically slow while overtaking cars in parallel lanes, causing the people behind me to slam on their brakes.
- Fast moving, but dense traffic seems to be the worst. It's not aggressive enough and confuses the people around me. Then will suddenly disengage or change speed, making the situation worse.
- Any time a lane closes or opens on a boulevard, it can't figure out where to go and swerves before disengaging.
- In moderate snow, without the Autopilot even engaged, the sensors go crazy, detecting every lump of snow on the road as an obstacle and sounding alarms constantly at speeds under 20km/h.
- Fully automated lane change is dangerous, usually wrong, erratic, and pointless.
- Not moving at the speed of traffic. Holding at 70km/h on long on-ramps for way too long, then attempting to get to 120km/h right at the end of the onramp.

If you watch FSD videos, some of this is improved, but a lot of it is not. It's mostly just the same kind of unreliable behavior in a wider array of situations.

The point of all of this is that it is not getting better very fast. And is bad enough now that I only really feel comfortable using it where I would have used cruise control in the past. Open highways, in a nearly straight line, with little traffic, and good weather. It's basically $10k cruise control. And when you add the nags, less automated than cruise control in some ways.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/l8q4vj/as_an_owner_i_dont_see_how_any_owner_can_think/,static416,16796.0,-0.9738
TeslaMotors,better,gzzj5h,I returned my Model Y back to Tesla - Full Story/Details,"I have been hesitant to post my experience on this subreddit, but ultimately decided this information should be shared with the community. I have added some more details from another post to help outline the facts.

As the title states I returned my Model Y PUP back to Tesla Monday. This was mainly due to safety concerns and poor customer service. I will try and keep my recap short, but there are several items to cover...

I took delivery Friday June 5th in Kansas City (Delivery Center that was assigned). On my way home to Oklahoma City, about half way, I heard some noise from under the car. I pulled over to find the front aero piece hanging down and not attached. I see that I am a mile from a Casino parking lot (in the middle of nowhere Kansas) and decide to limp it there to evaluate further. That mile I could hear terrible noises coming from the front, but I didn't want to be on the shoulder of the interstate dealing with this, so I slowly made it to that parking lot. I call Tesla Roadside and am given the option to drive it back to Kansas City for service or have it towed. They tell me that the towing option would be covered only if the issue is deemed to be a warranty item. If they find its a warranty item I can work on being reimbursed. At this point I had the car for 48 hours and driven 250 miles. I had not hit anything or gone over any rough terrain. I felt confident that this would be a warranty issue. So, in order to avoid any further damage to the vehicle, I opted for the tow and thought I would get this worked out at the service center.¬†

I had it towed to the Kansas City service center Sunday night. An interesting point to note is that there was miscommunication with the tow truck company, and the tow truck driver was told that Tesla paid for the tow in full, so I wouldn't have to sign anything or pay. I asked the driver a few times to confirm, and figured maybe if they find that it wasn't a warranty issue they add it to my service invoice (my first Tesla and Service Experience).

The next day (Monday) after finding accommodations in Kansas City for the night, I arrived at the service center in the morning to make sure everything was handled. Explained what happened, they apologize profusely and say they will take a look. After letting them work on it for a few hours, I hear nothing, but since I don‚Äôt live in Kansas City and have nothing to do, I decide to wait at the Tesla center. My advisor comes out and says the car is ready to drive, but since they don‚Äôt have parts they have just secured it to be ‚Äúdriveable.‚Äù No estimates on when they can get parts (I expected that) and we would address it as soon as they are available. He then tells me this absolutely is covered under warranty because the bolts were not secured properly and it wasn‚Äôt done right at the factory. So, I am glad to hear this, but seriously concerned by the oversight. My advisor then tells me I am responsible for the $1,100 tow truck bill. I am initially confused because the car could not be driven without causing more damage. I wasn‚Äôt close to any store where I could buy supplies to tape it up, and I don‚Äôt want to be blamed for more damage. They tell me I can contact Tesla corporate myself and plead my case, but not to expect much. Disappointed about this outcome, I decide to leave the store to try and get some answers from corporate. I spend the next hour trying to get through to a real person which shockingly is more difficult than I thought it would be. I was only able to get a hold of someone by using roadside assistance. I tell the situation to the agent and the agent confirms that ‚Äúif the repair was covered under warranty then the tow should be included in that claim‚Äù. So basically this issue is with the service center and not corporate according to them.

So my 3rd trip to the service center starts with them completely agreeing that this is a warranty repair. I then tell him that Tesla customer service on the phone said that if it‚Äôs a warranty repair then the towing should be covered. He agrees, but says management won‚Äôt budge. I say I will need this to be resolved because this is my 3rd trip here and the tow truck driver is calling my phone for payment. After a long back room discussion they tell me Tesla WILL pay for it, they just don‚Äôt know if the Service Department or Roadside Assistance group will be paying it. I also find out the long delays are because all of this is being done by email... They don't have a number to call someone about it. That seems like an impossible way to get anything done in a timely manner, but that what I was told...

At this point I am upset that this has been so difficult and wasted my entire day, and being an out of town customer looks like it will be a nightmare. I was only able to get this far because I stayed in Kansas City an extra night and took off work. I tell them I am returning the car and want to start that process. I think they were shocked and I was told this was the first time any customer had done this (at their location). I loved the car, I love Tesla and still do. I just can‚Äôt deal with this type of stuff in the future. I can update everyone on the return process as it continues. All they had me do Monday was sign a ‚ÄúReturn Declaration‚Äù and hand them the keys.

Haven't heard a word from anyone else at Tesla since yesterday at the store. I just hoping to get some confirmation that my refund is in process.

TL;DR - I bought a Tesla Model Y 2 days ago. A manufacturing defect caused me to be stuck 2 1/2 hours from home. Tesla covered the repair under warranty but refused to pay the $1,100 tow truck bill. With some of the delivery issues, this warranty repair, and the terrible customer service it made me rethink this purchase and I walked away. Still like Tesla, but will wait until things are more ironed out.

Some Clarifications

\- the ""aero piece"" is different than the Model 3, it is a hard plastic cover. Some have commented that its just a fabric. On my car it would drag and flap wildly hitting underneath anytime I went over 30 MPH.

\- My biggest concern was voiding the warranty. I could Uber 20 miles to get some tape or remove it. However, I was unable to get any confirmation from Tesla that if I proceed with taping/removing it that it wouldn't void my warranty.- I didn't really return it due to the failure, it was more from how difficult it was to get a hold of anyone at Tesla and discuss the issue. Living in a state that does not have any Tesla locations made me realize that if I had a problem it might be a difficult thing to resolve.

\- My comment about loving Tesla comes from all the things they are trying to accomplish. The car had very little issues (no more than any other new car I had purchased). I know there are some that are in terrible shape and there is no excuse for that. The car was great, and amazing to drive. They really just lost me on the on going support.¬†

&#x200B;

Edit: Some have asked for proof -  [https://imgur.com/a/LvHqk82](https://imgur.com/a/LvHqk82) \- This is the return document signed. It is not an early build for anyone tracking the VINs. The door listed a production date of May 2020, post factory shutdown.

Edit 2: A picture of the damage and panel -  [https://imgur.com/a/gLoZkms](https://imgur.com/a/gLoZkms)  \- The wind would catch this panel and it would hit the car and drag on the ground. My understanding is that the Model Y has a slightly different part than the older Model 3's that were using a fabric composite. I was not close to a store to complete my own repair, and no way to get a hold of Tesla and confirm my own temporary repair wouldn't void the warranty. Regardless, I was disappointed this part wasn't secured properly at delivery. I did not hit anything, you can see the front lip and the rest of the underside has not scrapes or damage.

Update 1: Just had a call with a Tesla employee at the Kansas City location. He confirmed that my return is in process and I should expect funds back in 15-20 days. He was very nice and professional, but couldn't offer any more information on if my situation will be reviewed by Customer Service leaders at the company.

TeslaMotors,better,yck0qy,Tesla Build Quality Already Better than the Competition,"A China [quality survey](https://twitter.com/MoneybaII_R/status/1583310020141203456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1583310020141203456%7Ctwgr%5Efd3da64134bc1a4f920092b75919a725367a1a02%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.teslarati.com%2Ftesla-model-y-china-reliability-quality-survey%2F) got some traction recently, showing Tesla at the top in quality ratings for Model Y and Model 3 compared to Chinese NEVs (basically, BEV, PHEV and FCEV).

I had just assumed that the same did not hold in the US because we keep seeing Tesla come out near the bottom of quality surveys like [JD Power](https://www.jdpower.com/business/press-releases/2022-us-initial-quality-study-iqs). But if you look at the fine print, that's wrong. Build quality is also better than average for BEVs in the US:

>ICE vehicles average 175 PP100, PHEVs average 239 PP100 and  **BEVs‚Äîexcluding Tesla models‚Äîaverage 240 PP100. (Tesla models average 226  PP100** and are shown separate from the BEV average because the  predominance of Tesla vehicles could obscure the performance of the  legacy automakers that have recently introduced BEVs.)

Tesla has 226 issues per 100 vehicles, while other BEVs hav 240 issues per 100 vehicles. We have been comparing Tesla with ICE vehicles: a new, rapidly iterating technology vs an old, slowly iterating technology. Reliability measured in terms of defect rates is strongly correlated with being able to do the same thing over and over with as little variation as possible. But in the BEV world, Tesla and everyone else is ramping up brand new products and trying new stuff constantly. Over time, the greater simplicity of BEV architecture will win out, and as the innovation rate slows down the defect rate will be even lower than for ICE. But right now, BEV is more innovative and experimental, and build quality suffers. For everyone.

But Tesla's greater experience and volume already puts it ahead. The others are playing catch up on quality as well as on price and volume for BEV. But I have never once heard this discussed. Has it been? If not, how did we all miss what was hiding in plain sight?

And yes, I get and accept the argument that ""the competition"" includes ICE. I was trying to make a provocative headline to bring attention to what seems like a neglected point.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/yck0qy/tesla_build_quality_already_better_than_the/,grokmachine,55734.0,0.943

TeslaMotors,better,ac9m63,Why the half tax credit is better for a middle income buyer,"So now Tesla has decreased the model 3 price by $2000. The federal tax credit is now 3750. GREAT!

Now people with lower income can get a full tax credit, and 2000 off the car. 

Let me put it like this. 

If you make $55,000 a year, your federal tax burden is $5400. If you had bought a model 3 last year you would have gotten $5400. Less, if you made less. For someone making $45,000 your federal tax burden is 3770. 

So, by buying this year the person making $55,000 gets a Model 3 for $5,750 less, and also pays $160 less in sales tax. Bringing the total to $5,910.

This person saves $510 by buying this year instead of last year.

The person making $45,000 a year Would have saved $3,770 last year, this year they also save $5,910.

The car costs them $2,140 less this year than last year. 

So this is a hidden benefit to the tax credit reduction to a private middle income buyer. 

Personally I am opposed to the tax credit being applied to any car priced over $50,000, or any car not American made.

TeslaMotors,better,nouln5,Vision only is never going to be better,"edit - majority of responses are along the lines of 'lol do you think you're smarter than Tesla' and personal attacks. This kind of thinking is so common nowdays. If you can't even bother to read and address the issues, then don't bother.

&#x200B;

The only reason for Tesla's stubbornness on this is because Musk will never admit he was wrong and wants to keep claiming that his company is the greatest and best and are doing something no one else can, no matter what the reality is.

Tesla's logic is - 'if both vision and radar are present, if they disagree one must win, and since vision is needed for FSD anyway, it has to win, so radar isn't needed, so new cars won't have it, and we aren't going to maintain 2 codebases, so current cars with radar will have it disabled soon'

This is BS. Computer systems don't work like this. They take multiple inputs and use them to augment each other. Not discard everything else.

Relying on a single source like vision to make all decisions is stupid. Its the equivalent of saying -

'I'll train my neural net to guess the temp based on a picture !! After analyzing billions of pics, it'll learn what the clouds, shadow, sunlight, moisture, drops all mean and be able to guess the temp !! This will then allow me to get rid of a 50c temp sensor that's accurate to 2 decimal places, charge people $500 for an advance version of TACTS (Tesla Automatic Camera Temp System) , and claim that my car does something no one else does !!'

or another example - imagine if hedge fund did analysis based solely on a single factor of a stock, like P/E, and ignored everything else.

Or if you decided that a house was worth buying or someone was worth marrying solely based on a picture, and ignored everything else.

Its nonsense. No matter how much AI you use, it will never ever be better than a system that also takes other factors into account. Tesla's arrogance is in their 'only use A or B not both'.

That's the software design part. There are 2 other huge issues :-

&#x200B;

1. perfect knowledge:  this is vision in the US, with wide open spaces, very little traffic, every single mm of road mapped out, perfect road signs and lane markings. Imagine doing this in countries without all this.
2. weather: there's a reason vision has limitations, its because its limited to what it can see !! and Radar/LIDAR isn't. I don't care how much computing power you use or how many cameras, you are never ever in a million billion years going to be able to 'see' in a whiteout or at night, or when its raining or foggy or a hundred other situations, as well as you could with a cheap radar. There's a reason the military with billions of R&D dollars doesn't say 'hey we're gonna abandon our night vision IR goggles and radar tech and just use camera !!'

There are tons of cars now with some kind of adaptive cruise control and based on posts here, all of them work better than Tesla's AP and esp the new vision only update. I mean for the cruise control part i.e. avoiding phantom braking etc.

Musk/Tesla know full well that real FSD is many years away, so in the meantime why not keep repeating the same promises, and at the same time start cutting features and parts to reduce costs, since by now their customers are used to getting broken, beta software for years and live in perpetual hope.

I discovered this by posting a story about Tesla to r/technology. It was blocked, but that sort of thing happens, often inadvertently, so I asked the mods if they would unblock it. /u/agentlame responded that ""That's better suited for /r/teslamotors.""

Well, that's true, just as Google stories are best suited for r/google, Apple stories for r/apple, etc. But I replied by pointing out that Tesla stories [are very popular on /r/technology](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=tesla&sort=top&restrict_sr=on), getting thousands of upvotes and being among the subreddit's top-rated stories of all time. Agentlame replied:

>Battery cars aren't 'technolgy' any more than normal cars are. Brand favoritism isn't a good reason to allow something that doesn't belong.

But the idea that the electric (and [robotic](http://www.engadget.com/2013/09/17/teslas-autopilot-car-project-targets-90-percent-of-miles-driv/)) future of vehicle tech isn't a technology story is something that [multiple](http://www.engadget.com/tag/tesla/) tech [sites](http://www.theverge.com/tag/tesla) that [cover](http://techcrunch.com/tag/tesla/) Tesla [seem](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aarstechnica.com+tesla&num=100) to [disagree](http://www.wired.com/business/tag/tesla/) with.

I was curious if this was just the whim of a single moderator, or a larger r/technology policy, so I looked for recent Tesla stories on r/technology.

[There are none.](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/search?q=tesla&sort=new&restrict_sr=on)

Tesla stories were frequent until three months ago, at which point all Tesla submissions suddenly stopped, save for a single post that slipped through the filter by using the plural ""Teslas"" in the title. I asked Agentlame if Tesla had indeed been banned from r/technology.

His response:

>Car stories should be submitted to car-related subreddits.

>Please inform your supervisors in the Tesla Motors Marketing department.

And then, from the main /r/technology account:

>**you've been banned**

>you have been banned from posting to [/r/technology: Technology](/r/technology) .

Not only is Tesla banned from r/technology, but so am I for finding out about it.

For better or worse, all subreddits, even the main subreddits visible to everyone by default, are the private playgrounds of whoever started them first. So it's up to them what to allow and not allow. But subreddits tend to be very clear about their rules. Not only was this ban not transparent, but the anti-transparency theme extended so far as to actually ban someone for noticing what happened. That just seems impulsively vindictive. I hope that Agentlame or someone else at r/technology will reconsider. The largest share of my karma, over 25,000 of these made-up Reddit points we play with, has come from contributions I've made to r/technology. I'd like to continue the conversation.

And in case anyone thinks there must be more to this story, that I must privately be some insufferable internet troll and that I surely couldn't have been banned just for asking if Tesla was banned, [here's a screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/FbXBuKE.png) of my full conversation with Agentlame.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/21lurz/tesla_is_banned_from_rtechnology_and_so_am_i_for/,canausernamebetoolon,902111.0,0.9549
TeslaMotors,better,9eiq2k,Why a Tesla is objectively better than an ICE car or other EV.,"**Update**: After reading some comments, I‚Äôm no longer sure a Tesla is objectively better than other EVs. My main reason was that Tesla batteries are superior, but I need to do more current research on that.

I wrote this as a comment to someone asking me why I claimed that Teslas are objectively better than ICE cars and other EV cars. I mostly assume a $35k model 3 for the comparison and the average driver. Each individual driver will subjectively decide if each point is important to them. There‚Äôs no one solution for everyone. The points themselves are the objective measurements.

There‚Äôs a lot that I learned overtime, and it took a lot of research and understanding. I wanted to create this post to help educate new Tesla prospects and also to allow people to know how to help other ICE people ‚Äúget it‚Äù.

Feel free to criticize or add additional points and I will take the feedback and update this list. 

Claiming that something is objectively better needs to make clear what we‚Äôre optimizing for. Road trips vs everyday driving. Routine maintenance vs collision repairs. I would argue that most people on average significantly benefit more from better everyday driving and better routine maintenance.

- **instant torque** is preferable to the average driver.
- **superior traction control** gives you millisecond reaction times, a fraction of what a ICE car can do.  
- **lower center of gravity** increasing handling performance. 
- **regen braking** significantly reduces brake wear. Brakes could last the lifetime of an ICE car.
- **higher elevation** does not degrade performance. 
- **it‚Äôs safer** with a front crumple zone. Crumple zones are much safer than no crumple zones.
- **cold starts** are not an issue unlike ICE cars that can fail to start. 
- **autopilot** Assuming v9 is released and Tesla delivers on what they are promising. Autopilot will be more advanced than any other car. It will pilot highways on-ramp to off-ramp. Tesla‚Äôs are the only cars that claim for such a thing to come to a production car in the near future.
- **full self driving** Assuming FSD will become a reality eventually, and Tesla delivers, you won‚Äôt have to buy a new car to have it. Not other production car claims such a thing.
- **you never have to stop and refuel** For the average driver, assuming they remember to plug in, your car charges every night at home. I don‚Äôt prioritize road trips since they are rare in comparison to everyday driving; on average, the convenience factor of everyday driving far trumps the convenience factor of road trips.
- **no exhaust fumes** can enter your garage or your car (at least not from your own car, especially for hatchbacks when you just start it up)
- **preconditioning** your car in you garage with the garage door closed
- **less maintenance** that‚Äôs also cheaper over the life of the car.
- **exceptional battery that will last a lifetime.** when comparing a [Tesla‚Äôs battery tech ](http://synergyfiles.com/2016/03/tesla-batterypack-optimization/) to other EVs battery tech. This is a huge point. [We have longevity data for Tesla](https://www.google.com/amp/s/electrek.co/2016/11/01/tesla-battery-degradation/amp/), and until data becomes available for competitors, Tesla sits as king. 
- **extensive supercharger network** allowing any cross country trip in the US and getting bigger every day here and in other areas of the world. 
- **a tech car that gets refined and enhanced over time** with over the air updates. The average person prefers over the air updates. Case in point: smart phones.
- **‚Äúfuel‚Äù is significantly cheaper**
- **you can heat or cool the cabin while away** from the car without having to ""run the engine"".
- **you‚Äôre not polluting** the air or the roads with fumes or dripping oils where you drive. [Even if your power comes from coal, you‚Äôre still polluting far less](https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2017/dec/25/how-green-are-electric-cars).
- **option to power your car with solar panels** and home batteries and pay nothing for ‚Äúfuel‚Äù.
- **you‚Äôre combating global warming**

Subjective points:
- **regen braking is amazing**. I‚Äôm a stick guy and it‚Äôs way better than downshifting.
- **you never have to go to a dirty gas station.** Who wants to touch a gas pump handle that‚Äôs been tainted with gasoline and engine oil from people doing whatever to their gas cars while filling up (topping off engine oil, etc), and have gasoline drip on their shoes or car, inhale the fumes, etc. 

Cons:

- **getting access to remote areas can be difficult**
- **battery draining to 0 can be a huge issue**
- **not an SUV**, although that will change once the Y comes out.
- **range is more expensive**
- **you need a place to charge at home**
- **getting repairs done can cost more and take longer to receive parts**
- **for the occasions you need to supercharge, it takes longer 20-30minutes**

There‚Äôs a reason why Tesla owners are fanatical and will never go back to an ICE car again. Above is an attempt to holistically articulate those reasons.

**Update**: this [particular comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9eiq2k/comment/e5pg1gb?st=JLVT7N9A&amp;amp;sh=576e19e4) is great. Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9eiq2k/why_a_tesla_is_objectively_better_than_an_ice_car/,mjezzi,39409.0,0.9969
TeslaMotors,better,y3bg89,"As a non-Tesla EV owner, I now get it!","I get it.  I now understand why so many people are emphatically over the moon with their Tesla. I myself drive an Audi e-tron and my wife drives a Volvo XC60 PHEV, but over the past week we drove a Model Y Long Range over 850 miles while on vacation. We drove it in downtown urban areas, suburbs, on the interstate, on back country roads, a National Park, and even an international border. After driving the car for a week in many different types of driving scenarios, I can confidently say driving a Tesla is the most complete EV experience currently on the market. The key word here is EV, as the majority of my dislikes stem around the car part of the Y we rented. The EV/Software part of the Y was nearly a full chef's kiss. The only thing that really left a bad taste in my mouth was a few aspects of the auto-pilot (AP) system.

Things I loved:

* Plug and charge
* In car route planning with charging
* Showing how many spots were open at a Super Charger
* One pedal driving
* Amazing efficiency
* AP can find and maintain a lane like no other system I've used

Things that were neat:

* The slight delay before regen kicked in when coming off AP, giving you enough time to get your foot on the accelerator.
* The speed limit recognition system automatically converting KPH to MPH when driving into Canada.
* The charge door opening when pressing the button on the charger handle
* Being able to watch a Hulu show while waiting to board a car ferry.

Things I didn't really care for but wasn't a big deal

* The two step door handles were a little annoying
* The driving info on the left side of the screen was a little gimmicky. I would have preferred to have a full screen map then an animation of a semi-truck that was actually a car pulling a trailer.
* The vegan leather looked and felt cheap but the seats were ultimately comfortable to sit in for hours which is really what is important.
* No real-time visualization of traffic along the route. I'm fairly certain traffic was taken into account when route planning, but there is no indication I could find to show it on the map. Ultimately not a big deal since it really did seem like traffic was taken into account when creating a route.

Things I really didn't like

* The suspension is subpar. The Y really needs better suspension and maybe even an air suspension system. Once the roads start to get a little rough, the suspension really started to show its faults. It was fine on smooth roads though.
* Road noise is a problem. It gets loud in the cabin over 60 mph, especially if the road is not perfectly smooth.
* There were various squeaks and creaks when going over bumps and on rough roads.
* Looking at the map while driving was a bit of a neck stretch. Like I said before, it would have been nice to have a full screen map or at least have it positioned closer to the driver.
* There is no cruise control speed memory past being able to automatically set it at the speed limit (or X% past the speed limit)
* The torque sensor for AP is not very sensitive. Our Audi is capacitive but the Volvo uses a torque sensor and only takes the slightly nudge to recognize an input. I could wiggle the Y's steering wheel and nothing. I ended up just flicking the volume up and down in these cases which was a little annoying.

Things that drove me bonkers

* Adaptive cruise control is way too sensitive. I only had one phantom braking instance but there were many times I would pass a parked car, a cyclist, a runner, a car turning left in front of me, and a few other things that would trigger a panic brake scenario. Our Audi and Volvo do not have this problem.
* No blind spot monitoring system. I found Tesla's solution to blind spots more effort and increased the amount of time when my eyes were off the road. Almost every other manufacturer has a light on the mirror which lets you quickly look in your mirror and see if someone is in your blind spot simultaneously. It's a two step process in a Tesla and I found myself manually checking my blind spots in heavy traffic situations.
* AP disabling every single time I changed lanes. In moderate traffic, this became a nuisance every time I moved into the left lane to pass someone.
* Auto high beams when AP was enabled. I ended up blinding a bunch of people because this system is not up to snuff. Our Audi and Volvo do not have this problem. I eventually just turned AP off after getting flashed multiple times by oncoming cars.
* AP is an all or nothing system. It's great at maintaining your lane, but in the rare instance it didn't,  I wish the system would let you make a small correction instead of disabling altogether. It was very jerky and would fight me in those situations. It just didn't feel safe.

I do want to touch on AP one more time as I was blown away by how well it would maintain a lane. It didn't matter if it was a construction zone with a temporary lane made of cones or a twisty mountain road full of switch backs. The darn car would stay in the center of the lane and handle almost any turn no matter how tight. It truly is next level in this aspect. The big problem I had with AP was the ancillary systems around it that made the experience like monitoring a toddler. Frankly, AP is much more advanced than Audi or Volvo's system but the latter systems are so much more relaxing to use, especially on the interstate where lane markings are generally good.

Alright. If you have read this far you're probably thinking I hate the vehicle after how much complaining I did but that truly isn't the case. The things that made the Y great were weighted much higher than what wasn't so great. Point being, the EV/Software aspects of the car are so polished that I get how people are willing to overlook some of the things Tesla doesn't do well with. Would I buy one? IDK. Maybe. It's hard to say since we already have two nice cars, but at the very least I get what the hype is about. I'm also having a hard time adjusting to not having one pedal driving on my e-tron after spending a week with the Tesla so there is that. :)

TeslaMotors,better,dbk05o,[Suggestion] Tesla's navigation should better estimate how HVAC (heat) impacts range,"It's starting to get cold again and I'm thinking about the inconveniences of cold climate driving (having initially gotten my model 3 just over a year ago). The only time I felt any range anxiety was during road trips last winter. I wish Tesla's navigation would better estimate how HVAC use impacts the range. Specifically the heat, the AC doesn't seem to hurt the range nearly as badly.

It's frustrating and stressful to be driving any reasonably long distance and have the navigation initially estimate you'll reach your destination with like 23% battery remaining and after an hour of driving it's dropped all the way to 6%. You have no idea how much further it's going to keep dropping and it can significantly change your travel plans.

Tesla must have some idea how (in)efficient the heater is. They could just calculate the effect based on the current exterior temperature and interior climate control setting. This would alleviate any range anxiety, and could allow for better planning of charging stops and range.

I know a workaround is to turn off the HVAC and turn on the seat heaters. Yeah, that sort of works for me personally, but it can still get very cold and it's hard to force upon other people. I can't imagine my buddy telling his wife and young daughter that. (Side note: Bonus points for tesla if they would update the range live between HVAC on and off so you could make a decision if it was worth it to deal with the cold, just using the seat heater.)

Anyway, thoughts?

**tl;dr:** Tesla's navigation should better estimate how HVAC impacts range using the exterior temperature and interior climate control settings. Cold climate range anxiety is real, this would significantly help alleviate it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/dbk05o/suggestion_teslas_navigation_should_better/,EvanVanVan,5719.0,0.9272

Chevrolet's Bolt EV and Bolt EUV are both below the price threshold, but in 2019 the automaker sold its 200,000th plug-in vehicle, at which point the tax credit began to phase out.

[Supercharging on the Way Home](https://preview.redd.it/uy11zpftgh831.jpg?width=4160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3947e75dfd6c0767121845235a5973ed8e72ea2e)

In November last year I took delivery of my black, rear wheel drive, long range Tesla Model 3. I‚Äôd never driven in a Tesla before, much less driven one myself. Still, the lure of a 300+ mile range fully electric vehicle and the soon to be cut in half Federal tax credit swayed me and my wife to take the plunge. Six or so months and 11,000 miles later, the car has more or less ruined me on driving any other vehicle. The Model 3 does things that feel groundbreaking and paradigm shifting, and, even more amazingly, in a, ‚ÄúWhy hasn‚Äôt it always been this way,‚Äù sort of way.

1. Entry, exit, and control of the vehicle through the app is pretty much flawless (note: with a modern phone) and doesn't require a dedicated device. Walking up to the car with your enabled smartphone means getting in is as simple as pulling on the handle. Other cars have similar behaviors with key fobs, but who wants to carry anything else around when I already have a computer with all sorts of connectivity options sitting in my pocket? This is what Tesla has done; eliminated something I used to have to carry around. The funny thing is I never really thought much about carrying keys around until I didn‚Äôt have to do so anymore. Now that I don‚Äôt have to carry keys, when I drive my wife‚Äôs car I‚Äôm very aware that I have this other device in my pocket.
2. The acceleration is effortless, silent, and addicting. Seriously addicting. I came to the Tesla from an economy sedan, so the difference for me is greater than someone who may have had another performance luxury vehicle, but oh my God is the acceleration just lovely. Even better, it‚Äôs all so effortless. When I get in another vehicle now and put the pedal down it feels like everything is just working so hard to achieve what the Tesla does instantaneously and with almost no noise (just an appealing motor whine that reminds me of the Tumbler in stealth mode in the Nolan lead Batman series). When someone in a traditionally powered vehicle drives past with their engine roaring, it feels like such an anachronism now.
3. The entire braking system does things the right way. The magnetic braking means I typically only have to use my physical brakes at somewhere between 4 and 6 MPH to come to a complete stop, instead of braking the vehicle all the way down from 60 or 65 MPH, which will clearly create far more wear on the braking system. The magnetic braking was the thing I was most nervous about initially, having read stories of people coming to jerky stops when getting used to it. Those fears were entirely unfounded. Except for my first toll booth stop (which was hilariously about 15 feet too soon), I‚Äôve found it entirely intuitive and easy to get used to. Now, when I drive a different car and take my foot off the accelerator I‚Äôm cranky about the fact that I have to push the stupid brake pedal down (what is this, the 50s?) to really slow the car, instead of the car just doing it automatically.
4. Speaking of annoying things you just do in your car without thinking about it, how about turning the car on and off? The Tesla system to turn the car on (you really don't, but you get it ready to go by pushing the brake pedal with your phone in your pocket) and turn it off (you really don‚Äôt, just open the door) doesn‚Äôt need to be a Tesla only thing. Any car with a key fob could do both of these things, really. Why do they require me to push a different button? Speaking of that, the fact that the Tesla automatically locks the doors when you get out of range takes a little getting used to (there‚Äôs initially a fear it won‚Äôt work) but once you do it‚Äôs another one of those little things that all cars should just do, but for some reason don‚Äôt. Note, however, that getting used to this stuff means you‚Äôll probably leave your other cars running accidentally. My wife has caught me just hopping out of our other car a few times without shutting it off. Sorry, I thought this was 2019.
5. The minimal gauges was something I loved from the moment I sat in the car for the first time. It took about 10 minutes to get used to looking slightly right instead of slightly down for my speed, and (admittedly) about a week to get used to the lane obstacle detection in the same location, but it‚Äôs all so clean and tidy. The internal navigation is fantastic (and the 3D perspective it gives is a nice touch), and the infotainment system works well (generally). I was initially worried I‚Äôd hate not having SiriusXM (and honestly, I still think for this level of car it should be an option), but I ended up cancelling my app-based Sirius subscription about 2 months after getting the car because there are a ton of options built in for free. Getting into a more typical car now feels like information overload, with dozens of dials, gauges, and buttons competing for my attention, and LED light coming from every direction. Driving the Model 3, in particular at night, feels far more connected with the outside world because of the minimal distractions within the cabin.
6. What does gas cost right now? I honestly don‚Äôt know, but up until November I‚Äôd always had a sense of what it cost per gallon, because I was filling up every 6 days. Even better, my wife barely has to fill up more than once a month because on the weekends we pile all five of us into my car for basically every drive (us plus our three daughters). Our other vehicle (a Pacifica) is relegated to times where we both need to go somewhere or we‚Äôre driving a long enough distance that having three kids in the back is going to lead to arguments. Otherwise, even though the kids clearly have significantly more space in the minivan, they always want to drive in the Tesla. This gets me to another reason this car has ruined me on other cars. Sure, I need to charge, but I just plug in when I get home, and I head in to the house. No more freezing while pumping gas in the middle of February. Sure, I lost approximately 25% range in the Winter months due to the cold, but that‚Äôs not much of a problem when you can ‚Äúfill up‚Äù every night (scheduled to use off-peak electric prices) if you‚Äôre worried about your range, and the car is filling up while I‚Äôm reading, hanging out with the wife and kids, or sleeping.
7. How about service? I had a minor squeaking coming from the back wheels when reversing (common problem) and my horn would only sound when I pushed the right hand side (again, common). I scheduled service within the app for the nearest location, and then Tesla sent a message a few days later saying that these issues could be addressed by their mobile service system, so they drove to my house and did everything in my driveway. I didn‚Äôt need to go to some shop, sit in their waiting room for who knows how long, try to work using their wifi, etc. I just hung out at my house, doing what I usually would, and they fixed the two issues. Awesome.
8. Software updates are flawless and fast. You get notified on your phone that an update is available, click to start the update process, and then a little later get notified that the update is complete. By comparison, software updates in our Pacifica created a situation where climate control was broken for a month while they figured out what went wrong, and updating my old car required me to download images to a flash drive and sit with the car running for an hour while the update was applied. Updates are also super frequent and not insignificant in what they‚Äôre doing, including things like adding 5% more range to the car and better power (as if that was really necessary).

To be objective, however, there are some annoyances:

1. Voice control is still pretty limited. My 2012 Ford had better voice control options (voice and phrase detection was far worse in that car, which is pretty much flawless in the Tesla, but there were more phrases it would recognize), including some that I think are absolutely necessary, like, ‚ÄúCall Sarah on mobile.‚Äù Right now in the Tesla I can only say, ‚ÄúCall Sarah,‚Äù and it lists all the numbers I have for her in my contacts, which requires me to scroll to find the right one and tap on it on the display.
2. Speaking of phone control, the pick up / hang up options should be able to be ‚Äútapped‚Äù through the steering wheel buttons.
3. Cell connectivity sometimes just flakes out for the in-car infotainment. I park underground at work, so the car won‚Äôt have LTE coverage in the garage, but it also seems to just lose the ability to reconnect when I come back up above ground (probably weekly). A couple of times a month it seems to require a soft reboot to get it to reconnect to LTE.
4. The piano black plastic covers for the center console area are scratch and dust magnets. I tried to wrap them but messed it up the first time so I haven‚Äôt tried again. Still, for an expensive car I‚Äôd think they‚Äôd have a nicer setup in such a prominent area. It‚Äôs pretty clear this is a common complaint when center console wraps are such a common purchase for Model 3 owners.

Two other points worth mentioning quickly:

1. This car is more contagious than a yawn at the DMV. A friend and my parents both bought Model 3s after driving in mine basically once. It‚Äôs that nice. It‚Äôs that different.
2. I recently got back from a 3.5 hour drive in our other car (family vacation), and I immediately volunteered to go get groceries, just so I could drive the Tesla. Usually the last thing I‚Äôd want to do is drive more after a long drive. Instead, it just highlighted the advantages of the Tesla.

So, that‚Äôs it at a high level. The Model 3 has ruined me on other cars, and it has done so by concentrating on the everyday aspects of car driving. In the Kano model, it has basically added delighters and performance features that everyone else is just checking the box on. It takes a lot of things we just take for granted as ‚Äúthe way it‚Äôs done,‚Äù and reimagined them in a way that feels like it‚Äôs redefining what driving should be in the 21st century.

TeslaMotors,better,7asdkg,Tesla ruined my Mercedes,"I have been driving my Model S every day for about a month.  My other car is a fully loaded Mercedes E class.  Before buying the Tesla the Mercedes was by far the best car I ever owned.  I decided against trading it in for the Tesla because I loved it so much...  This past week circumstances arose such that I had to spend over four hours driving my Mercedes.  The ride felt like complete crap.  I felt like I had to mash the throttle to accelerate, the tiny navigation screen is a joke, I had to remember to turn off the car and lock the doors, no auto pilot.  I never want to drive that two year old $60K car again. Tesla turned my perception of my awesome Mercedes to a piece of shit Ford Pinto in one month.

Edit:

Mercedes wasn‚Äôt actually fully loaded as I didn‚Äôt have distronic or designo leather.  The point of the post was to say how much better the model S is to my other car which I thought was amazing before",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7asdkg/tesla_ruined_my_mercedes/,javyQuin,4370.0,0.9551
TeslaMotors,better,acjdrt,Tesla Autopilot HW3 details,"For the past few months Tesla has been slowly sharing details of its upcoming ‚ÄúHardware 3‚Äù (HW3) changes soon to be introduced into its S/X/3 lineup.  Tesla has stated that cars will begin to be built with the new computer sometime in the first half of 2019, and they have said that this is a simple computer upgrade, with all vehicle sensors (radar, ultrasonics, cameras) staying the same.

Today we have some information about what HW3 actually will (and won‚Äôt) be:

What do we know about the Tesla‚Äôs upcoming HW3?  We actually know quite a bit now thanks to Tesla‚Äôs latest firmware. The codename of the new HW3 computer is ‚ÄúTURBO‚Äù.

Hardware:

We believe the new hardware is based on Samsung Exynos 7xxx SoC, based on the existence of ARM A72 cores (this would not be a super new SoC, as the Exynos SoC is about an Oct 2015 vintage).  HW3 CPU cores are clocked at 1.6GHz, with a MALI GPU at 250MHz and memory speed 533MHz.

HW3 architecture is similar to HW2.5 in that there are two separate compute nodes (called ‚Äúsides‚Äù): the ‚ÄúA‚Äù side that does all the work and the ‚ÄúB‚Äù side that currently does not do anything.

Also, it appears there are some devices attached to this SoC. Obviously, there is some emmc storage, but more importantly there‚Äôs a Tesla PCI-Ex device named ‚ÄúTRIP‚Äù that works as the NN accelerator. The name might be an acronym for ‚ÄúTensor <something> Inference Processor‚Äù.  In fact, there are at least two such ‚ÄúTRIP‚Äù devices, and maybe possibly two per ‚Äúside‚Äù.

As of mid-December, this early firmware‚Äôs state of things were in relative early bring-up. No actual autopilot functionality appears included yet, with most of the code just copied over from existing HW2.5 infrastructure.  So far all the cameras seem to be the same.

It is running Linux kernel 4.14 outside of the usual BuildRoot 2 environment.

In reviewing the firmware, we find descriptions of quite a few HW3 board revisions already (8 of them actually) and hardware for model 3 and S/X are separate versions too (understandably).

The ‚ÄúTRIP‚Äù device obviously is the most interesting one. A special firmware that encompasses binary NN (neural net) data is loaded there and then eventually queried by the car vision code. The device runs at 400MHz. Both ‚ÄúTRIP‚Äù devices currently load the same NNs, but possibly only a subset is executed on each?

With the Exynos SoC being a 2015 vintage and in consideration of comments made by Peter Bannon on the Q2 2018 earnings call, (he said ‚Äúthree years ago when I joined Tesla we did a survey of all of the solutions‚Äù = 2nd half of 2015), does this look like the current HW2/HW2.5 NVIDIA autopilot units were always viewed as a stop-gap and hence the lack of perceived computation power everybody was accusing Tesla of at the time of AP2 release was not viewed as important by Tesla?

SOFTWARE:

In reviewing the binaries in this new firmware, u/DamianXVI was able to work out a pretty good idea of what the ‚ÄúTRIP‚Äù coprocessor does on HW3 (he has an outstanding ability to look at and interpret binary data!):

The ‚ÄúTRIP‚Äù software seems to be a straight list of instructions aligned to 32 bytes (256 bits).  Programs operate on two types of memory, one for input/output and one for working memory.  The former is likely system DRAM and the latter internal SRAM.
Memory operations include data loading, weight loading, and writing output.  Program operations are pipelined with data loads and computations interleaved and weight fetching happening well upstream from the instructions that actually use those weights.  Weights seem to be compressed from the observation that they get copied to an internal region that is substantially larger than the source region with decompression/unpacking happening as part of the weight loading operation.  Intermediate results are kept in working memory with only final results being output to shared memory. 

Weights are loaded from shared memory into working memory and maintained in a reserved slot which is referenced by number in processing instructions.  Individual processing instructions reference input, output, and weights in working memory.  Some processing instructions do not reference weights and these seem to be pooling operations.

u/DamianXVI created graphical visualizations of this data flow for some of the networks observed in the binaries. This is not a visualization of the network architecture, it is a visualization of instructions and their data dependencies.  In these visualizations, green boxes are data load/store. White boxes is weights load. Blue are computation instructions with weights, red and orange are computation blocks without weights.  Black links show output / input overlapping between associated processing operations. Blue links connect associated weight data. These visualizations are representative of a rough and cursory understanding of the data flow.  Obviously, it is likely many links are missing and some might be wrong.  Regardless, you can see the complexity being introduced with these networks.

What is very interesting is that u/DamianXVI concluded that these visualizations look like GoogleNet. At the outset, he did not work with the intention to see if Tesla‚Äôs architecture was similar to GoogleNet; he hadn‚Äôt even seen GoogleNet before, but as he assembled the visualization the similarities appeared.

Diagrams: https://imgur.com/a/nAAhnyW

After understanding the new hardware and NN architecture a bit, we then asked u/jimmy_d to comment and here‚Äôs what he has to say:

‚ÄúDamian‚Äôs analysis describes exactly what you‚Äôd want in an NN processor.  A small number of operations that distill the essence of processing a neural network: load input from shared memory/ load weights from shared memory / process a layer and save results to on-chip memory / process the next layer ‚Ä¶ / write the output to shared memory.  It does the maximum amount of work in hardware but leaves enough flexibility to efficiently execute any kind of neural network.

And thanks Damian‚Äôs heroic file format analysis I was able to take a look at some neural network dataflow diagrams and make some estimates of what the associate HW3 networks are doing.  Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt find anything to get excited about.  The networks I looked at are probably a HW3 compatible port of the networks that are currently running on HW2.

What I see is a set of networks that are somewhat refined compared to earlier versions, but basically the same inputs and outputs and small enough that they can run on the GPU in HW2.  So still no further sightings of ‚ÄúAKNET_V9‚Äù: the unified, multi frame, camera agnostic architecture that I got a glimpse of last year.  Karpathy mentioned on the previous earnings call that Tesla already had bigger networks with better performance that require HW3 to run.  What I‚Äôve seen so far in this new HW3 firmware is not those networks.

What we know about the HW3 NN processor right now is pretty limited.  Apparently there are two ‚ÄúTRIP‚Äù units which seem to be organized as big matrix multipliers with integrated accumulators, nonlinear operators, and substantial integrated memory for storing layer activations.  Additionally it looks like weight decompression is implemented in hardware.  This is what I get from looking at the primitives in the dataflow and considering what it would take to implement them in hardware.  Two big unknowns at the moment are the matrix multiplier size and the onboard memory size.  That, plus the DRAM I/O bus width, would let us estimate the performance envelope.  We can do a rough estimate as follows:

Damian‚Äôs analysis shows a preference for 256 byte block sizes in the load/store instructions.  If the matrix multiplier input bus is that width then it suggests that the multiplier is 256xN in size.  There are certain architectural advantages to being approximately square, so let‚Äôs assume 256x256 for the multiplier size and that it operates at one operation per clock at @verygreen‚Äôs identified clock rate of 400MHz.  That gives us 26TMACs per second, which is 52Tops per second (a MAC is one multiply and one add which equals two operations).  So one TRIP would give us 52Tops and two of them would give us 104Tops.  This is assuming perfect utilization.  Actual utilization is unlikely to be higher than 95% and probably closer to 75%.  Still, it‚Äôs a formidable amount of processing for neural network applications.  Lets go with 75% utilization, which gives us 40Tops per TRIP or 80Tops total.

As a point of reference - Google‚Äôs TPU V1, which is the one that Google uses to actually *run* neural networks (the other versions are optimized for training) is very similar to the specs I‚Äôve outlined above.  From Google‚Äôs published data on that part we can tell that the estimates above are reasonable - probably even conservative.  Google‚Äôs part is 700MHz and benchmarks at 92Tops peak in actual use processing convolutional neural networks.  That is the same kind of neural network used by Tesla in autopilot.  One likely difference is going to be onboard memory - Google‚Äôs TPU has 27MB but Tesla would likely want a lot more than that because they want to run much heavier layers than the ones that the TPU was optimized for.  I‚Äôd guess they need at least 75MB to run AKNET_V9.  All my estimates assume they have budgeted enough onboard SRAM to avoid having to dump intermediate results back to DRAM - which is probably a safe bet.

With that performance level, the HW3 neural nets that I see in this could be run at 1000 frames per second (all cameras simultaneously).  This is massive overkill.  There‚Äôs little reason to run much faster than 40fps for a driving application.  The previously noted AKNET_V9 ‚Äúmonster‚Äù neural network requires something like 600 billion MACs to process one frame.  So a single ‚ÄúTRIP‚Äù, using the estimated performance above, could run AKNET_V9 at 66 frames per second. This is closer to the sort of performance that would make sense and AKNET_V9 would be about the size of network one would expect to see running on the trip given the above assumptions.‚Äù


TMC discussion at https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/teals-autopilot-hw3.139550/

Super late edit - I looked into the DTB for the device (something I should have done from the start) and the CPU cores could go up to 2.4GHz, the TRIP devices up to 2GHz it looks like? (the speeds quoted initially are from bootloader).

TeslaMotors,better,aqcxnu,I spent a week with an Autopilot HW1 loaner. HW1 still does some stuff a lot better than HW2.5.,"**Note:** I don't want this to be perceived as disparaging against Tesla's recent efforts, because on the whole, HW2.5 is a much better system than HW1. With that said, I think there are a number of things that Autopilot HW1 (developed by Mobileye) does a lot better than Tesla's in-house system.

* Autopilot can be engaged whilst mid-turn (HW2+ needs the steering wheel to be essentially straight to engage). This is *super* handy for freeway on-ramps.
* Lane changes engage nearly instantly. My initial perception was that HW1 didn't check blind-spots‚Äîbut it does‚Äîit just reacts way more quickly once the car determines there isn't traffic inside of its 5m ultrasonic sensors. Because of this, the car feels a lot more ""aggressive"" and lane changes inside of heavy traffic are actually doable. My Model 3 could no sooner switch lanes during rush hour than fly to the moon. Or to Mars.
* When performing a lane change, the car speeds up (very quickly to the set point) as soon as the turn signal engages. This might be a bit bad for efficiency, but it doesn't EVER slow down or attempt to enter a faster-moving lane at the same speed when attempting a lane change. I feel like HW2+ often performs the lane change first and then decides to speed up once it is inside the lane. Even cooler, if there is a car beside you (in the lane you want to enter) but there's also a car in front of you, HW1 speeds the vehicle speeds up and performs the lane change at the same time rather than what HW2+ does which is slow down and allow the car beside you to pass (this is fine when you're changing into a lane to the left, but not vice versa, very poor form if you're the leftmost vehicle).
* When two lanes merge together, HW2+ tries to center itself in between the two merging lanes which is unnecessary (often cuts other drivers off) and causes the vehicle to unnecessarily over-steer at high speeds. With HW1, the vehicle hugs the visible lane markings until a normal-sized lane returns.
* HW1 isn't as fixated as staying dead-center of the lane. I found this to be more annoying than not as the HW1 car would often ""rubber-band"" in-between the lane markings whereas HW2+ cars stay dead-center of the lanes nearly all the time. However, there is one big benefit: when passing semis/vehicles that are very close to intruding in your lane, the ultrasonic sensors would turn yellow/red and the Tesla would hug the opposite side of the lane to give you more space in between your car and the vehicle in the lane next to you.
* HW1 can read speed limit signs. I think this is a Mobileye patent and that's why we don't see it in HW2+, but Tesla should license it. I have multiple speed limits that have been changed in my city (some as long as 2 years ago) that still aren't up to date in the GPS database. HW1 cars head at the speed that GPS tells them until they see a sign that says otherwise and then they adjust to the posted speed limit. Can you imagine how awesome it would be if the car could see flashing school zone lights and automatically slow down to 20MPH? I REALLY liked this feature.

Any thoughts? Any owners with HW1 that think I missed something? Again, this isn't to slander HW2+ because Tesla's in-house system does most stuff quite a bit better than HW1, but we shouldn't forget that HW1 has its strengths and HW2+ should continue to improve.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/aqcxnu/i_spent_a_week_with_an_autopilot_hw1_loaner_hw1/,SnazzyLabs,28779.0,0.9903

TeslaMotors,better,c0e6oz,How Owning a Tesla Changed My Life,"Many of us here talk about the features of our cars, the newest firmware update, the little problems (and sometimes big), and nuances of owning and driving a Tesla.  But I want to shift the conversation for just a moment and speak to how owning a Tesla has impacted my life as a whole.  I emphatically encourage anyone else here to share your story, good or bad, as well.  So here goes...

&#x200B;

I commute about 3 hours a day in heavy LA traffic.  Next to NYC, it's probably the most grueling nightmare of lane changes, starting and stopping, praying to the Gods of Sidestreets that you can make it home with a fraction of your sanity still intact in the US.  The HOV lanes are a small reprieve at times, but often just as congested as the regular ones.  On any given day, most of us that live here probably in jest wish for a quick death to end it all just so we don't have to sit in another hour of traffic; yet somehow we prevail to drive another day.  We drove our dumb cars, in dumb traffic, with dumb people, and even dumber gas prices.  This was our plight, and yet we were resigned to it, even though with every breathe we said ""Dear Lord, why me?  What did I do to deserve this?""  We returned home fatigued, haggard, with barely enough energy to cook a good meal for ourselves or our families.  We fell asleep during movie night with our significant others because the road took what life we had left in us at the end of a long work day.

&#x200B;

Then Tesla came around and offered me an alternative.  While not perfect by any means it was light years better than what I'd ever experienced.  I've driven all sorts of beaters in my life, but my last was not what one would consider an uncomfortable car to drive.  My old 335d dutifully got me from point A to B while trying it's best to smooth the bumps in the road, however it was still a comparably a dumb car despite it's price tag.  When that car caught fire and burned to the ground because of a recall issue, I vowed to be brave and try something different.  Out of this wanderlust came my Model 3 LR AWD; a technological marvel.  I work in tech and can discern what's good and just mediocre.  From day one hopping into the frying pan of traffic and enabling the AP, I found a freedom I never knew before.  Throughout the long stretch of the 405 in LA it did nearly all the heavy lifting.  It kept me safe by ensuring I was the proper distance behind traffic to avoid rear ending someone, which is sometimes a challenge because of a vision depth perception issue I have with my eyes.  I no longer awoke in the morning dreading the day, the drive to and from work.  I trusted that this car, quiet, efficient, safe and smart would deliver me to my job and allow me to work to my full potential.  By the end of the day I immediately noticed that I had the energy and mental acuity to better tackle my tasks as a father and husband at home.  Even though it's been only a couple months of owning a Tesla Model 3 the nights where I told my daughter I was too exhausted to play Shopkins with her, or tell my wife that I didn't have the energy to cook us a good dinner is a thing of the past.  I'm so much happier now, and so are the people around me that I love the most.  Yes, there are sometimes little glitches.  Sure, sometimes service has lagged when I needed it.  But all in all, if I had to slap down the same amount of cash down on a car I'd buy this one again in a heartbeat.  I have the deepest amount of gratitude to Tesla for what it's given back to me; my life.  I have faith that it will only continue to get better over time with Full Self Driving, OTA updates, and improved service.  But what it's given thus far is so much, and means the world.  I never expected or thought that something as simplistic as a car could have such a deep impact on my life, but when it comes to my family and my ability to have what I need at the end of the day to give them what they are worth, it means everything.

TeslaMotors,better,etkxhk,A better builtin Spotify UI!,"I don't know if someone else has already shared this, but TIL that since the builtin Spotify client is actually a Spotify Connect client, you can use other Spotify UIs to control it.  I know that last year somebody developed TesPlayer to control a phone streaming via Bluetooth from the built in browser.  I thought to myself, well, if the car is a Spotify Connect client, and the car's browser is now Chromium based, can't I use Spotify's own web player control the car's music?   So I opened up the browser and cranked up [open.spotify.com](https://open.spotify.com) and lo and behold, I had a better Spotify UI in my car!

It works best if you're already playing a song in Spotify on the car when you start, since it doesn't look like Spotify Connect is running unless that's happening.  But you can control your playback on the panel at the bottom and pretty much do anything with playlists you want since it's the full web player UI.   It's not without its glitches but it works great, well, other than the usual connectivity issues we know about. Dunno why I didn't think of this before!

TeslaMotors,better,alt8v2,[Discussion] On the call Musk said they don‚Äôt plan to use 2170 Cells in the Model S/X. I am no expert on batteries. Could they just repackage the older cells better and get improved range? Or is this a sign that they may have an even newer cell type that will go into the S/X?,"If you change the chemical make up would the cell type (2170) change or is that just the name of the ‚Äúcanister‚Äù?

Tesla is still at the top of the heap for range so maybe they just don‚Äôt care yet about more mileage till Rivian or other get their act together?

My hunch is they have a newer cell coming out that will go into the S/X and the 3/Y will keep the 2170.  Especially since they said 76% of the Model Y was the same as the Model 3.

The last part that contributes to my hunch is Musk not giving away their cost per kw to produce.  Saying it was proprietary.   I think people have already figured about how close they are currently.  So I am wondering if they have made some more big jumps and don‚Äôt want to say...like in a new battery type.

TeslaMotors,better,6giiao,My Model X 90D Driver Side Falcon door opened on Freeway driving 65mph with my 6 y.o. sitting next to it,"Please see below our Tesla Experience... any input as to how we can share our story for child safety and expedite our refund from Tesla would be appreciated.  This is our email to the service manager of Tesla

Hi Sandra

I‚Äôm writing to you as per our telephone conversation to formally request Tesla to refund the cost of our Model X 90D vehicle due to its compliance with the California Lemon Law.  We purchased the car on January 5, 2017 and has had a slew of problems that will be detailed below.  However, the most notable problem that fall under the California Lemon Law is the driver side falcon door; which despite at least three attempts to fix opened while driving on the highway.  Thus it would fall under the part of the law that states, ‚Äú Your vehicle‚Äôs problems could cause death or serious bodily injury if it is driven, and the manufacturer or dealer has made at least two unsuccessful repair attempts.‚Äù

As a recap of our conversation, you state that you have contacted the legal team and they responded that if the car is in compliance with the California Lemon Law the refund should be a ‚Äúslam dunk.‚Äù  This process will take between 4-8 weeks and you will assist in attempting to shorten the time as you have done successfully before.  You were also adamant in helping us understand that you have had your engineers meticulously check through the car and replace the faulty parts.  The car has now passed the quality checks and we are to return the loaner and pick up our car to drive as normal until the refund is fully processed.  We were also asked to verbally approve a 100 mile test drive so that Tesla can do its due diligence for their quality check.    However, since the faulty parts that were replaced are the same that has been done before without full resolution of the problem I voiced my concerns in continuing to drive the car.  As we purchased this car specifically for our parents who have difficulty getting in and out of our higher cars, we would feel more assured if Tesla can give us a definitive assurance that the door has been fixed since we are forced to drive the car until the refund is complete.  You informed us that Tesla, as well as any automakers in the world would never give that sort of assurance that their fix would not break again.  As my six year old son was sitting next to the falcon door that opened on the highway, this is an answer that is very difficult for me to accept.  I had pleaded with you to consult with your legal team to make sure that we are really unable to keep the loaner because driving the faulty car will give us additional anxiety. Also if the door is potentially not fixed the damages may be much more serious the next time and perhaps irrecoverable. My suggestion is as much for our family‚Äôs safety as well as Tesla‚Äôs decreased liability.  You informed me that there is nothing more you can do for us.  As the car is now ready for pickup on Friday and Tesla has a 72 hour window for pick up you have given us clearance for pick up of car on monday June 12, 2017. 

Below I will go into a detailed timeline of our experience with Tesla.  I hope this will help the refund go smoothly and efficiently.

On Sept. 21, 2015 we reserved our Model X

On Jan. 11, 2016, we configured our Model X. 

On Jan. 5, 2017 we picked up the car and brought it home, there was warning sign that there was low windshield fluid and the software needed to be updated at the service center only.  Thus the car was not fully serviced upon delivery of car. 

On Jan. 7, 2017 We were heading to a children‚Äôs birthday party.  The car started to beep non stop on the freeway.  We had to pull over and call roadside assistance for help to reset the car twice before it returned to normal. 

On Jan. 9 2017, we brought back car and they updated software which took more than a few hours.  They also filled the windshield wiper fluid to full.  

When we took the car back home, after a couple of hours, we realized our garage was flooded with windshield wiper fluid.  Apparently the windshield wiper fluid container was cracked.


On Jan. 10, 2017, we brought the car back but they didn't have parts and we waited a week for it to come in.

Meanwhile while we were doing paperwork for rebate and the HOV lane stickers, we realized the VIN on all our paperwork were incorrect and we had to contact sales to get them rectified and resign all paperwork.

On Jan. 16, 2017, we brought in the car to fix the windshield wiper fluid container and resign all the paperworks.  

At this service we met Tanya, Service Adviser, who informed us if we had any issues to personally contact her and she will assist us at her utmost.  However as the problems continue to arise, Tanya no longer responded to our communications after the April falcon door incident. 

Along the way, while more frequently on the highway driving, we realized we were hearing wind sounds coming in from the right side passenger window. Also the passenger side falcon door was squeaking

On Jan 26, 2017 we brought the car back and the technician found the seal was not installed properly on the window and changed a new one.  The door was also readjusted.  

On Jan 28, 2017 while at the mall the driver side falcon door was unable to open no matter which button you press.  However the car read the door as being opened.  We immediately called roadside assistance, they advised since the car seems safe to drive we should drive to our service center as it was a Saturday and they were still open.  See service report to see work done.  We picked up the car on Jan 30, 2017. 

After this service, we were upset at how many times we'd visited this service center since pickup and they offered Tesla merchandise as compensation but we said no. We would at least want the first year service free.  They agreed. 

In March, the passenger side window with which they fixed the seal became increasingly squeaky when opening and closing the window. Thus we had to bring it in to service on Mar. 27, 2017 to fix. 

On April 23, 2017 at the Water Grill Restaurant in Costa Mesa, the driver side falcon door was unable to open again despite pressing all different buttons.  We left message at service center as they were closed on a Sunday and called roadside assistance to reinforce to the service center that we will need service on our car ASAP due to the car beeping that the door is open when it is not.  Roadside assistance reassured us the car should be safe to drive due to it being ok the first time this happened.  However, once we got home after 45 minutes the car was still on because the falcon door is read as open.  Roadside assistance request to manually turn off car and leave door open overnight as any motion in the car would turn it back on again. Roadside assistance was also confused as why the car did not turn off itself after 45 minutes as it should with no movement.  

On April 24, 2017 we brought in the car for the fix and on April 25, 2017 we were called to pick up the car as ready.  However on April 25 upon pickup the technician was demonstrating that the door was fixed but after one attempt the door became stuck again and had to be immediately put back to be serviced.  Despite the fact there is only one service ticket for this fix, it should technically be counted as two as they were delivering the car to us the door broke and we had to make an extra trip on April 26, 2017 to pick up the car they reassured us was fixed.  

On June 2, 2017 we were at Toy R Us in costa mesa with our parents and our 6 year old son, a total of 5 people.  For context, my son sits next to the driver side falcon door, me in the center and my mom on the right. My husband and father are in the front.  As we were leaving, the left side falcon door was stuck again.  We immediately called the service center due to it being Friday but since it was late in the day we left a message as they were already closed. We started to drive home because through our previous experience we were always advised to drive the car back to the service center as the car is still drivable.  During the ride, I was calling the roadside assistance to write up a ticket to reinforce to the service center to call us to schedule service first thing in the morning. While on the phone with roadside assistance, I head a click in the door and the motor as the door started to lift open.  I grabbed onto the door with my left hand and held on and the door had about a 2-3 inch gap.  We had been on the road for approximately 15 minutes at this time and were on the 5 north freeway right before the Tustin Ranch Exit.  We immediately exited and parked in the Tustin auto center.  The door opened once we parked and clicked closed once the button was pressed. As we were close to home and can drive home via local streets, we drove home.  We informed roadside assistance to immediately set up a tow first thing in the morning on Saturday as my son‚Äôs birthday party was on that day.  In our eyes, the car was not safe to drive and we were all severely traumatized by that event.  Had the door opened the damages would have been irrecoverable and my son‚Äôs life was put in imminent danger, a feeling no parent should ever have to feel.  

As it is, we are still forced to drive this car by Tesla due to our parents physical limitations.  Per Roger the head technician during our phone call on Jun 6, 2017 he is confident that he had pinpointed the problem of the door and he was very apologetic in not doing a more comprehensive check the few times before we came in for this problem. He is confident that the problem is fixed however Sandra you are unable to do the same before we pick up the car again. Again, the conflicting messages worry me for the sake of my family‚Äôs safety. 

We had high hopes for Tesla as indicated by how long we wait for our car. We are severely disappointed by the quality of the our Tesla and the customer service that we are receiving.  Please review our case as soon as possible as we do not feel safe in this car.  Please send me a confirmation that you have sent in our formal request to the legal team and they are actively processing our case. 

Thank you

TL/DR model x falcon door faulty, attempt to fix 3 times, opened during driving on highway, put my child in danger, tesla wants us to continue to drive car, won't guarantee its fixed until they might/might not refund car based on lemon law

We have just connected with Jon McNeil and he seems eager to assist us to resolve this issue.  We will have to wait and see for the final results.

I hope he helps us resolve this issue quickly.  I see that there are many who think we've sensationalized our story but unfortunately it is all true. It is really disheartening. Perhaps ""pooled"" may have been a better word than ""flooded"" but it doesn't take away from the fact that they delivered a over 6 figures car with a defect that should have been caught during their strict quality checks.  However the main point is still the falcon door opened while we were driving on the freeway.  We're grateful to be safe.  We are hoping that they will let us keep loaner until the refund process is complete and that is all.  That being said, we can't control everyone's opinions and we're not trying to, just sharing our experience so other who are considering the car can make more informed decision, especially parents.

Also, assuming everyone has the same problem that songs on USB sticks don't resume where they left off when you get back in the car, I've noticed if you open and close the back doors (like when kids get in first) then get in the driver's seat, the song often resumes (as it should).

TeslaMotors,better,j595ns,So Tesla‚Äôs quality control is really bad. Our brand new model y‚Äôs entire roof just fell off,"My dad bought a brand new model Y today, and he brought me along to pick it up just in case he needed help with any tech problems. Everything was going fine and we were driving back home when we started to hear a ton of wind. I thought maybe a window was open but a minute later the entire glass roof just blew off.  After a brief panic we turned around and drove the new Tesla convertible back to the dealership.

When we got back we called highway patrol to tell them that there was a car roof somewhere on the 580, but somebody might have gotten into an accident, I‚Äôm not sure. The manager at the dealership said that either the seal for the roof was faulty, or the factory just ... forgot to seal the roof on? I can‚Äôt imagine how something as big as the roof not being attached could make it past quality control. Has this ever happened before?

Edit: The manager offered to get the car serviced for free, but we declined and are probably going to get an entirely new car. Whether we're still getting a Tesla is up to my dad but probably not.

For comparison, even though the Laguna Seca is a short track with relatively low top speed, a 1:30.3 lap time is still an amazing performance that's [right among the cream of the top ICE supercars](https://fastestlaps.com/tracks/laguna-seca-post-1988). Personally speaking I'm very interested in the aero, suspension and tire setup they used, and hopefully the car remains a good daily driver.

I'm looking forward to them revisiting Nurburgring next year. I am calling them either getting close to, or break the 7 minutes barrier for the Nurburgring time.

TeslaMotors,better,rpvjtr,V11 interface theory...it's for first-time Tesla owners more than anything.,"The v11 interface has plenty of stuff for long-time Tesla drivers like the blind spot camera and light show and so on, but it's the interface changes that are bothering us.

Perhaps the biggest complaint is that things that used to be right there on the bottom bar are now hidden in a menu (sometimes two layers deep).

After using it for a bit, I have a theory about why things are the way they are. With the ""apps"" being draggable, that sort of makes sense...they're preparing for a future where there are more apps. Perhaps an app store, or maybe just more apps and services. 

But with the controls, I think this release is acknowledging that the ""new Tesla owner"" experience can be a little confusing and the company clearly plans for there to be a LOT of new customers over the next year or two. They're at a 1M/yr run rate now and have two plants coming online in the next 3-4 months.

When someone buys their first Tesla, as I did a year ago, it's a little confusing how some things are on the bottom bar, some things are in the main car screen menu, and some things are in submenus. It's not clear which controls you can work from the steering wheel and which only work on the screen. 

This release, for all its faults, does two things well. One, it puts pretty much all the critical driving stuff on ONE screen. You tap the car icon, and all the things you need while driving are right there. There's more on that screen, it's a better use of space, it's clearer for first-time Tesla owners. Odds are if you want to know ""how do I [common car thing you do while driving]"" it's on that screen when you tap the car icon.

If you ever use the screen to do something you can do with the steering wheel, a little tutorial popup appears to tell you how you can use the knobs on the steering wheel (like if you skip forward on a music track or adjust the volume). I don't recall ever seeing that before.

I think they've got a little work to do, sure. Showing dual AC controls when the AC isn't split is more confusing than not and takes up valuable space. They could allow a few more icons on the toolbar, they don't need a ""recently used apps"" section, and if they let us drag most common controls down there instead of just apps it would solve nearly all problems.

But I think, from the 30,000-foot view, this update probably makes the ""first time Tesla"" experience a bit less confusing. And it seems to me, with the huge number of anticipated first-time Tesla owners over the coming year or two, that may have been a primary motive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/rpvjtr/v11_interface_theoryits_for_firsttime_tesla/,jasoncross00,73389.0,0.6708
TeslaMotors,better,ceftpj,2 weeks with my first Tesla (MX): NOT the best car I've owned.,"Every car I've owned since my ¬£220 ford escort estate right up to my ¬£30,000 Audi S5 convertible has been in several ways better and a lovely evolution of my car experiences.  Faster, more comfortable, better tech, better build quality.  Every car has been a better car in some way.   I work extremely, save up, and get the rewards with a better car.

&#x200B;

I was expecting the same with Tesla.   I was wrong.

&#x200B;

Had I got the Jaguar F-PACE SVR (or Porsche Cayenne Turbo) that I wanted to get instead, it would almost certainly be a better car in many ways, just like my previous upgrades. Tesla, however, is not  a better car.  It is totally demeaning to suggest so.  Yes, it's better, but it's not in the same league as ""a car"".   Yes ok it has wheels and you can drive it around like you do a car, but other than that the experience is something completely different.    Yes it's (MUCH) faster,  yes it's nice inside but... that's really it.   It doesn't drive like a car, it doesn't act like a car.

&#x200B;

I wake in the morning, open the app and remind myself where I parked it, I check to see that it has been updated and what new features it has, I check to see how much is ""in the tank"" and then I check the temperature and if too hot or cold I ask it to prepare the temperature for me as I shower.  I walk to the thing and the door opens for me and I sit in, it closes.  A huge glorious screen reminds me what meetings I have on for the day as the seats and steering wheel jiggle me into my favourite driving position.   I talk to it and it brings up a load of music I want it play.   I tell it where I want to go and the glorious screen gives me a load of options I can either call or just drive to.   I then start driving.  Without having to turn the thing on by pressing a button or inserting a key.  It just drives.   But driving is an unfair description in this case - it doesn't drive the way I know it, it kind of glides.   I sit there in silence as I glide around effortlessly.  A grunting muscle-car revs his dinosaur at me at the lights and within seconds he's a spec in my rear mirror as I glide away at what should be terrifying speeds in a car, but feels like teleportation in this thing.  Teh throttle isn't a throttle it's a teleportation pedal. Press it and you get instant torque and are where you want to be in soothing silence.  Before I know it I'm on a slightly wider road (no not a motorway, just a simple A or B road) and I flick autopilot and I'm just sitting there looking around at the scenery as it twists and turns and take  me through traffic. I flick through radio stations and discover new music in the meantime.   I get to my destination, glide into my space, get out the car and the doors just all close and it locks itself up. \[this isn't made up this is all a daily actual experience\]

&#x200B;

For anyone who doesn't have a Tesla this all seems like exaggeration of little perks, but it's not, it's basically all amounts to a  completely different experience.

&#x200B;

This is not a car, it feels like some sort of UFO type thing.  Some sort of robot beast you sit in that happens to have wheels and use them on the roads.   Drives don't feel like drives they feel like robot teleportation experiences.   They are so much more relaxing, and when I want it to be, they're sooo much more fun too, like when I humiliated a Jaguar F-Type on windy roads on Saturday.

&#x200B;

This is why this feels NOTHING like my previous experiences of just getting a better car. This thing is no more a car than the best smartphone is an old wired-in landline telephone.   An iPhone bears the name phone but in truth it's a palm sized portable PC and camera that can also make calls.   I've left cars behind.  This is a technological beast or ""robot"" as my daughter calls it, that has wheels, moves on the road in a majestic way and resembles what we used to call cars.  I've not got a better car, I've now got a Tesla.

&#x200B;

Welcome to the future! :)

TeslaMotors,better,lhrapq,"Given Tesla's emphasis on tech, is it better to lease a Tesla over purchasing outright?","I've been looking at the various models, and generally (not exact, but close) the lease price of a Tesla with an agreement for 15k miles/year, for 3 years, is roughly half that of a cash purchase, all upfront.  

This basically means that you could go through 6 years of leasing for the same cost of buying outright.  But you have not vehicle trade in value following the 6 years.  

I would assume that the emphasis on tech would depreciate the value quicker, but looking at some older models, such as 2017 Model S', they are currently selling for around $40-45k, on the low end.  Do older Tesla's really retain that sort of value?

I'm trying to decide whether or not it is better to lease, and invest the money saved through the term of the lease, and use it later when getting a new lease.  I generally try to hold onto cars for around 5 years, but I'm trying to challenge whether that is a good strategy or not.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/lhrapq/given_teslas_emphasis_on_tech_is_it_better_to/,The--Strike,61707.0,0.9469
TeslaMotors,better,y78460,Basic Autopilot problems getting worse and worse by the update. Stop-and-go traffic basically unusable.,"I‚Äôve had my ‚Äô22 M3 RWD coming up on a year. It of course was always fully Vision Only with no radar. Over the past year, I had to wait for updates to get up to similar specs as the radar enabled cars: following distance, finally 85MPH, etc. Overall in the beginning, I didn‚Äôt have too many complaints with Autopilot. I didn‚Äôt have the phantom braking that many did. The only complaint I had early on was Autopilot drove too aggressively in stop-and-go traffic. Mainly it would fully accelerate up if the car in front just barely moved. It was so embarrassing I would never use it with guests in the car. I was able to work around that for the most part by lowering autopilot speed and changing to chill mode in those moments. Not ideal but it somewhat worked. I would do every software update in hopes it would fix it, like a lot of do. Fast forward to today. I down right refuse to use Autopilot in traffic because of how dangerous it is. It drives like a teenager learning to drive. It still does that full acceleration thing but now it slams on the brakes as soon as a car in front stops in stop-and-go traffic. And when I say the car in front stops, I don‚Äôt mean they slammed on their brakes, they were driving like a normal good driver would. I‚Äôve had two different times where the brake check my cars does causes the person behind me to almost hit me. Needing to swerve off to the side. I‚Äôm too fearful to use it for the day when a driver behind me is just a tad distracted and bam, accident.  My old tricks of speed, following distance, chill mode, don‚Äôt seem to matter as much. 

Is anyone else dealing with this shit? I keep hearing they are gonna combine the FSD stack and life will be bliss but I‚Äôm not holding my breath. Stop-and-go traffic is the true time Autopilot should shine but I‚Äôd honestly say that I‚Äôve driven in shittier competitors cars and they do a smoother job of it. Tesla really needs to get their head out of their asses and address things like this. I‚Äôve owned TSLA for a long time and followed the M3 since release. I feel we are reaching a critical time for the company with all the competition. It depresses me to say that right now, I might recommend others to look at different manufacturers for a car.

TeslaMotors,better,9s5wx9,Why $5000 is better than free unlimited supercharging under almost any circumstance,"So let's breakdown how much supercharging you would need to do (at current prices) for this $5k

So in California, supercharger costs 0.26c per kWh. We're going to round and just say $1 = 4 kWh. This represents the highest cost of supercharging as far as I know.

$5000 is therefore equivalent to 20,000 kWh. As others with a P3D+ know, our efficiency isn't the best. Especially around town. Only around town driving and supercharging makes this worth it, so I'm going to assume a relatively poor efficiency of 350 Wh/mile and also compare to 250 Wh/mile.

20MWh at 350Wh/mile is 57,000 miles
20MWh at 250Wh/mile is 80,000 miles

So to make the $5k more efficient (ignoring time cost for doing it, money i can make by investing the $5k etc) AND assuming I charge all of my miles with supercharging, you are talking minimum 60k miles before it's worth it. In the state with the highest charging cost and assuming a quite poor efficiency.

So yea, if you drive 20k-30k miles per year for work and exclusively supercharge? Totally worth it for you. But most people will have to do nothing but supercharge for 5 years (assuming the average of 12k miles per year) to breakeven on the most pessimistic scenario possible.

TeslaMotors,better,dd7b59,V10 Autopilot is soooo much smoother on the highway!,"First thing I noticed was the rapid acceleration when behind a car that‚Äôs stopped and started moving again, so much better. The braking is very smooth and spaced out perfectly, it doesn‚Äôt stop aggressively leaving the car behind you to stop really quick. It moves over in the lane when cars (mainly semi‚Äôs) get too close, THE DANCING CARS ARE ALSO GONE! I was on follow distance 2 and had a car cut in between us and then kept merging to the next lane and my car didn‚Äôt even hesitate, just kept going smoothly! That impressed me the most! 
  
Overall the feeling of Autopilot V10 has taken a massive leap forward and actually feels very human like. To think more updates that improve these cars like this will keep coming out makes Tesla 1 of 1. The happiness this car has brought back into my life is indescribable. Truly grateful to own and drive such a rare item, the 0.01% the hand sanitizer didn‚Äôt get. What a time to be alive...here‚Äôs to the next 16 years!

TeslaMotors,better,bqh3o5,Tesla roadside assistance needs to be better,"TLDR: Roadside assistance can‚Äôt help with a flat tire, had to leave the car and rent a Chevy to get home. 

I was stranded on the highway 3 hours from home with a flat tire at about 3 pm yesterday. In any other car, this is a simple inconvenience. Call roadside assistance to put on a spare or do it yourself. Unfortunately, this car comes with neither a spare nor a repair kit. Roadside assistance is the only option if you haven‚Äôt gone out and bought one. 

I happened to be just a few miles from a Tesla service center. I called Tesla roadside assistance thinking they could throw on a spare to get me going again and then I could deal with the flat when I got home. 

No luck. All they could offer was a tow to the service center who could look at it on Monday. Alternatively, they could tow it to a tire place of my choice but they couldn‚Äôt tell me which ones would work on a Tesla. I tried 3 of them and none of them would touch it. 

In the end, my car was towed away and I remained on the side of the road until an Uber could take me over to a car rental place. Now, I wait until I hear from Tesla so that I can arrange transportation 3 hours back to pick up the car. 

I‚Äôm disappointed, to say the least. This makes me rethink just what kind of driving this car is suitable for. If this happens on my daily commute it‚Äôs easy enough to deal with. Out on the highway, hours from home and with a 2 day ETA for a simple tire replacement, it‚Äôs a nonstarter. 

Ideally, the wheel should have been replaced on the side of the road. A delay of 2-3 hours while they tow it to the nearby service center for replacement would have been cool too. A local tire place they‚Äôve partnered with could do it and that would be great. Even if they had told me they could get it repaired by morning, I would have gotten a hotel room and figured it out. 

Leaving someone on the side of the road with a flat tire that can‚Äôt be repaired for 2 days is unacceptable. 

I had a few choice words for them yesterday. I‚Äôve had the car for 2 weeks and it has 1200 miles. If I was within the return period I‚Äôd be tempted to tell them to shove it and keep the car so I don‚Äôt have to drive another 400 miles round trip  to pick it up. 

What do all these people taking road trips in Tesla‚Äôs do about tires? Is the repair kit good enough for a couple hundred miles? Carry a spare?

My point of this is to thank Elon.  He and the company have provided me with upgrades to the car, and its technology since I purchased it.  Thats right, they have had my money for months now and yet they continue to make my car better, and safer for me, my family, and others who share the road.

I spread the message because I am tired of listening to the BS attempts to undermine this technology company and it's leader.

  
To see the volunteers showing up en masse to assist in making delivery process smoother, thank you all.   You are part of the revolution, and it is amazing to see  you parf of this giant leap forward in the industry.

&#x200B;

If you are waiting for your car....you are going to love it.   If you are driving something else, time to seriously think about the Tesla brand....you will not be disappointed.

TeslaMotors,better,y8kszy,Suggestion for better accident prevention - Mass Spectrometry Cameras,"It seems to me that the self driving experience is presently very good, yet installing hyperspectrometry cameras next to the present cameras could further reduce the accident rate.

The benefit of this technology is it can describe exactly what periodic elements are within a given pixel, from large distance away.

Accidents like mistaking a trailer for the sky wouldn‚Äôt happen again, because one is made of metal and the other is mostly nitrogen and oxygen. 

Accidents like mistaking a bicycle being walked over a pedestrian crossing wouldn‚Äôt happen, because people are mostly carbon and their clothes would have a recognisable chemical signature also. Obviously movement can also be determined.

TeslaMotors,better,18wcumo,First External Review of FSD v12,"X post:

#FSD beta v12.1 is finally here. I received the OTA update while our family was vacationing at Universal Studios in LA. I couldn't wait to get home and upgrade to FSD. The release notes for 12.1 were surprisingly simple, stating that v12 has single-stack end-to-end neural nets trained with millions of video clips for the driving controls. This replaces the previous 300k lines of C++ imperative programming. Essentially, we now have to ""trust the nets"". So, how do I feel about FSD v12 after driving 500 miles? 

Here is a quick rundown:

Positive Surprises

The car drives more like a human. My wife couldn't tell whether it was me driving the vehicle or the car itself.

Highway situations:

FSD v11 (single-stack highway and locals) already handled highway driving quite well, but you could still sense the mechanistic nature of the C++ code in the control decisions. FSD v12 feels so natural. 

Here's one scenario that really surprised me: You're driving in the fast lane (left) of a two-lane highway because slower cars stay in the right lane. Then a faster car approaches from behind. FSD v12 signals, safely switches to the slower lane, lets the faster car pass, then switches back into the fast lane and stays there.

Speed control is much smoother and appears to adjust itself smoothly with the surrounding traffic flow.

FSD v12 is more patient and assertive during lane-changing maneuvers. There's no more ""middle-of-the-change hesitation"" (changing mind in the middle of a lane change).

City steets driving:

One of the ""hardest"" problems that FSD v11 and earlier versions failed to solve in my nearly three years of testing FSD beta is a surprisingly simple setup ‚Äì what I call ""neighborhood laneless road snaking"". It's very common in neighborhoods, where there are single-lane roads wide enough to accommodate roadside parking, or simply single lanes that gradually diverge into more lanes, or vice versa. All previous FSD versions struggled and tended to snake left and right within what the car perceived as a ""wide"" lane. Because of this single defect, I could never convince my wife to trust FSD driving. Well, that's finally gone in v12 with the end-to-end neural networks for driving controls ‚Äì it simply learns how a good human driver would handle such a situation ‚Äì just stays the course.

v12's handling of bumps is excellent! It reduces speed very smoothly to about 10 mph while going across bumps, making the ride super smooth.

Areas for Improvement

STOP signs: The car really doesn't have to wait a full 5 seconds (I know it's less than that, but it definitely feels that way) at every STOP sign. Every time, I have to push the accelerator to make it go a bit faster. Even if I had the patience, I'm sure the driver behind me wouldn't ‚Äì they'd be thinking, ""What the hell, you're driving a Tesla?!""

Perfect speed control is challenging because some speed signs are simply incorrect. You can't have a 40 MPH speed limit right in the middle of a highway, or try to accelerate to 70 MPH during a ramp onto the highway. It's definitely better in v12, but this still remains the main input I have to adjust from time to time.

Road conditions can sometimes be dangerous. There may be potholes, foreign objects that a good driver would constantly stay alert for and safely maneuver around with fine steering adjustments. I haven't tested FSD v12 enough in such situations, but I believe it will need continuous training to accommodate all these hazardous road situations and learn how to safely handle them.

As stated by Tesla, it is now mainly trained for good weather conditions (such as in California), and still needs a lot more training in areas with heavy precipitation, including rain and snow.

Conclusion

FSD v12 with single-stack neural networks for driving controls is definitely the (ONLY) right path forward. In fact, I think Tesla should have taken this approach much earlier rather than wasting time and effort tuning the C++ code for driving controls, which would have made it practically impossible to realize true FSD. 

Now with FSD v12, I see a step change that fundamentally solves those ""hard-to-solve"" issues ‚Äì just mimic humans! The rest is just more data and more training. That's it!",https://x.com/goproai/status/1741867410976891047?s=46,mjezzi,39409.0,0.9955
TeslaMotors,better,e1pnsh,Make Me Feel Better,"I ordered the tri-motor model first, but am having second thoughts on it.  I am definitely going to get one, but am starting to lean more towards the base model.  I don't think I will be towing much, if anything at all.  More about the bed and the space inside. Also don't really need the 2.9 0-60 besides more for having fun.  The only reason I really want the Tri is for the 500+ miles on a charge.  But after thinking about it today, I don't take many road trips over 200 miles.  Maybe once in a while, but by the team these monster trucks come out, there will be plenty of chargers/superchargers along major interstates (even here in the midwest).  Plus it would save me 30k and my wife might actually okay this one.

After thinking about it today, I dropped down from the Tri to the Single. Anyone else start rationalizing the configuration?

TeslaMotors,better,xjdkye,First FSD impressions (also looking for hints on making better videos),"Like many others, I was surprised by getting FSD downloaded to my car (2019 Model 3) this morning, so I took it for its first test drive, which is my \~3 mile commute to work. It definitely does not drive like a human in many ways (e.g. ponderous at stop signs, drives too far to the right in a lane, confused about a wet stripe on the road that was reflecting the sun ), but nonetheless, I was actually fairly pleasantly surprised at how well it did. I had two disengagements (one where it was going to go at a stop sign when it was not yet my turn, and one where it turned right so widely that it ended up in the wrong lane), but it also dealt with some fairly tricky things, e.g. at a construction zone where a lane was closed. As my first experience, it was much better than I expected, and I look forward to further updates, which I assume will be built based on a lot more data based on how widely this has been released. However, I do not see the UI element to submit video clips at the top of my screen - anyone else experiencing that?

&#x200B;

Finally, I did video my drive using my phone on a tripod in the back of the car, but viewing it back, it's a poor video (and was stopped when someone called me).

TeslaMotors,better,caljv3,Drove a Tesla model 3 for the first time yesterday. Holy balls.,"I scheduled a test drive about two weeks ago and drove 2 hours yesterday to finally experience the car I‚Äôve read so much about. I gotta say, holy shit! Better than I could have ever imagined! Handling was perfect(didn‚Äôt get to try out sport steering option which I regret), acceleration was crazy, it was like I was constantly in the 6k rev range of an ICE car but without the annoying engine sounds that accompany that. The ride was comfortable, lots of room in the back and the glass roof just makes the car feel so much bigger. Also made sure to look at the panel gaps that people complain about and I guess this one just didn‚Äôt have that problem as I saw no difference between the model 3 and the Audi parked next to it. Though they did have some older model s that did seem to have some weird gaps. I could say so much more about this car but I‚Äôll just say that it exceeded all of my expectations. 

On a side note, I brought my parents with me and my dad also got to drive it. He would not shut up about it on the way home. ‚ÄúThis car is the future‚Äù and ‚Äúif I‚Äôm gonna buy a new car, it‚Äôs gonna be from the guy who builds rockets‚Äù. They were also super surprised that the guy who drove with us didn‚Äôt try to sell the car afterwards. I tried telling them that Tesla doesn‚Äôt have dealerships but they were convinced that there would be some sales tactic involved. 10/10 experience.

TeslaMotors,better,ejli8u,"2021 will be even better than 2020, and then add Gigafactory Berlin in 2022","Tesla has proven that it can:

- Grow at an exponential rate ( [Model T Production Ramp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T#Price_and_production) - [Model 3 ramps beats it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_3#Deliveries))

- Increase production while reducing costs (Surprise Q3 profit - cost reduction was not 'Priced In')

- Go Global (Gigafactory Shanghai built in 10 months - 2 more months to 1000 cars/week rate with 1 6 day - 10 hour shifts)

- Give accurate Forecasts - needed to judge growth companies (Nailed it - predicted Deliveries 2 Quarters out)

And the real money on Wall Street seems to be in agreement - TSLA - $454/share Intraday High - All Time High

Beyond this it is anyones call, but I strongly believe Tesla's unique mission will allow it to expand into the entrenched Global Automobile Market as possibly an OEM for EV subsystems; drivetrain, batteries, Integration Platforms, Recharging Network, Patent Sharing, Autonomy Platform. With a negotiated profit margin on all inequitable partnership, say, 10-30% or more.

TeslaMotors,better,nnbdk1,SF to LA this weekend - I5 vs 101? Which is better for charging stall availability?,"Driving SF to LA tomorrow, and coming back later in the week. I would prefer the 101 just because it's more scenic and interesting (and fewer semi trucks) and appears to only add 30-45 minutes to the trip. I have a LR Model 3.

I see there is a high-speed station on the 101 in Greenfield. It has half as many stalls as the Firebaugh one on the I5, but I've heard the I5 stations tend get very busy and have a wait, especially during holiday weekends. Case in point, when I look at the Tesla Trip Planner website it doesn't even show the Firebaugh station as an option, so I'm guessing that means it currently has no stalls available.

So does anyone have some insight they'd be willing to share? Is there usually a wait at the Greenfield high-speed station on a Saturday? Should I stick to the I5? Will there be long lines since it's Memorial Day?

Thanks in advance for any help you can offer!

***EDIT: Updating this thread for future readers, in case it proves valuable. We ended up taking the 101 route both directions (heading south early on a Saturday morning, back north on a Wednesday afternoon). It did take about an hour longer than it would on the I5, but to me it was completely worth it. Supercharging was not an issue - there are plenty of v3 stations in Greenfield, Paso Robles, Goleta, Santa Barbara and at East Katella Ave in Anaheim which is close to Disneyland. Traffic was much lighter than what I've experienced on the I5, especially commercial traffic, and the scenery was fantastic for most of the drive, especially compared to the desolate, boring, fatiguing terrain of*** ***~~Mordor~~*** ***I5.

TeslaMotors,better,h78h21,Engineering Explained did a good review of the SpaceX version of the Roadster. Most talk is about horizontal thrust. The better approach to me seems to be mostly vertical/downward thrust. Increase traction without damaging surrounding vehicles.,"So there are a lot of problems with horizontal nozzles.  You are shooting compressed air at all the vehicles around you.  So it can only be used in certain scenarios.

If you put the thrust mostly down and then a little in the direction you wanted to go you, you could increase traction with the downward force, not blow the car or people near you out of the way and still increase the 0-60.

I believe and correct me if i am wrong, as you gain speed you need less traction since you have momentum.  So you could lessen the downward thrust as you go faster to reduce the power needed to get the acceleration of a vehicle as heavy as the car would seem at launch.  

Also does anyone know if the mass of the car being lighter but with more downforce would hinder acceleration as much as just a heavier car?",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/h78h21/engineering_explained_did_a_good_review_of_the/,hoppeeness,90346.0,0.2846
TeslaMotors,better,dhhz92,The Model 3 did better in AAA pedestrian detection tests than it seems...,"I recently went through the whole AAA pedestrian detection test report and saw some interesting data.  Both cars that failed to stop at 20mph (Malibu and Model 3) actually detected the pedestrians far enough away to stop.  For some reason, the Malibu never applied emergency braking and the Model 3 always waited to brake until it was only a few feet away.  If both cars simply adopted the same interval Honda has between alert and emergency braking, they would've aced the 20mph tests.  I go over everything in this video: https://youtu.be/tkAtRw51jGY

TeslaMotors,better,y2bwo8,Things I wish my Model 3 had,"I have a 2020 M3P with over 50K miles on it and have driving across the USA several times and here is what I'd like to see in no specific order or priority:

\- Bring back radar, Vision SUCKS. Way more phantom braking events, and autopilot slows down in foggy conditions when with radar it did not. Also, radar would show cars in front of me 2 or 3 deep, now with vision, all I see is the one in front on my visualization screen. Although, vision seems to do a better job at lane-keeping. So, a hybrid radar/vision might be best. It‚Äôs so bad that I rarely use autopilot anymore because when I do, I‚Äôm always on edge, ready to unintentionally brake check someone at a moment‚Äôs notice. You know a function is badly designed when the user is incentivized to NOT use that function. One of the biggest reasons I and probably most people bought Tesla was because of autopilot, and now it‚Äôs degraded to the point of not using it. 

\- Implement a dumb cruise control that only keeps the speed constant like every other car. I don't want phantom braking and making people angry behind me who think I brake checked them, I don't want to slow down in foggy conditions or around curves, I don't want lane keeping, I don't want distance keeping, I don't want 85 MPH to be my top limit. I just want the speed kept constant as if I had my foot on the accelerator and nothing else. 

\- Allow switching of accelerations speeds by tapping the ""chill"" word, just like tapping the battery changes it from % to miles. Or have different driving profiles available at the tap of a button, like the M buttons on BMW M cars. I don‚Äôt want to change my entire Driver profile to do this. 

\- Fix the music UI where half the song's name and band can't be seen even though there is plenty of real estate in the music bar. Show the time/time remaining in the song instead of just having the status bar at the bottom. 

\- Allow us to turn on/off the driver and passenger HVAC independently. I know you can change temps on both sides independently, but sometimes I just want mine on when there is not passenger or when my passenger doesn't want air in their face without having to change the direction of the air flow every time. 

\- Speaking of HVAC, for the love of God get rid of that stupid SLIDER to change fan speed. It‚Äôs thin and very hard to use while driving. It obviously didn‚Äôt go through real world driving tests. Go back to having large + or ‚Äì buttons to change it. In fact, make all buttons large and easily accessible and get rid of any sliders anywhere. 

\- Get rid of the auto-wipers and auto-high beams when in autopilot. I hate when I have no control over functions of the car. If vision requires both to be on, then vision isn't good. Go back to radar and keep ultrasonics. 

\- If possible, give the M3P a slight acceleration boost, even if at the top end. There used to be a large gap between the M3P and M3LR, which is what distinguished the two and why people paid a premium for it. Track mode is a nice distinction, but not enough. The acceleration boost for the LR was a money grab and diminished the value of the M3P. I know they don't want to eat into Model S sales, but people who get the Model S/X are probably more into the luxury aspect that pure speed (I could be wrong). 

\- Go back to the Apple IOS style UI/Icons and not this Android looking one. It doesn't fit the aesthetic of the car. 

\- Allow customization of how many ""clicks"" a turn signal includes. 3 is way too short

\- Allow us to have different ‚Äústyles‚Äù of UI. For example, I could have a Road-trip style, which increases the map size and gets rid of the 3D car animation. I could have a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù style, which shows speed and gear and that‚Äôs it. You get the idea. Many cars do this already by emphasizing speed, or RPMs, or oil pressures, etc. on their digital displays with the click of a button. 

\- In addition to Chill/Normal/Sport/Ludicrous modes, have a purely ECO one where all but necessary functions are turned off to maximize range and efficiency. 

\- It was nice allowing us to change the color of our 3D model, but if we added assets for aftermarket taillights or other wheels, that would be cool. It could even be something others create, and we can upload via thumb drive. It‚Äôs weird to see my 3D model with the wrong wheels and taillights since I got both replaced. 

\- Why is the walk-away door lock sound the horn honking? Tesla‚Äôs have external speakers, so make it a pleasant locking sound like other EVs do and not this loud obnoxious honk. Even the reverse humming sound is more pleasant than the honk. I hate coming home at night to my apartment and having my car honk. I could turn off the walk-away door honk, but that isn‚Äôt the point. I shouldn‚Äôt have to not use a function because it sucks. That is indicative of the function itself needing fixing. 

\- Allow retrofitting for powered frunk/trunks, new center console, heated steering wheels, and other upgrades just like they are doing with the CCS adapter. In fact, my Tesla SC is installed the newer side repeaters because I asked them to. They don‚Äôt suffer from the blinkers blinding them at night and have better low-light visibility. It‚Äôs a $350 retrofit though. 

\- Tesla needs to be more open to and more responsive when allowing other auto shops to buy Tesla parts. My go-to auto guy could not get certain parts from Tesla SC no matter how many times he reached out. But when I scheduled an appointment with the SC, they magically had the parts ready to go. 

\- STOP removing functions in a car I already paid for. This is the double-edged sword of OTA updates. We get more cool features and more power, but on the flip side, we lose some functionality like radar and ultrasonics. Imagine buying a cellphone with certain functions and later the manufacturer removes some of those functions even with the necessary hardware still installed. Now imagine some of those functions were big reasons you bought the cellphone. And you have no say in rejecting these updates or risk being out of warranty. Totally unacceptable for a $50k plus car. 

\- If Tesla removes features in an update, they should refund the owner for said removed functions. Like removing Alcantara headliner on later Model 3s. Now it‚Äôs this cheap beige fabric garbage. Not ‚Äúluxury‚Äù at all. Or removing radar/ultrasonics. I paid for that hardware and functionality and dammit I want to use it. 

\- Why are some features on my state-of-the-art electric vehicle not available that are available on some other cheap cars? Ventilated seats? 360-degree vision? Lowering the sound when a phone call comes in? 

\- Need more factory paint options. 9/10 Teslas I see on the road are white and it‚Äôs so damn boring and monotonous. Wraps are expensive and don‚Äôt last forever. A full paint job is even more expensive. 

Overall, amazing car in its totality, literally revolutionary. I know all the above fixes can‚Äôt and likely won‚Äôt be changed, but you never know. Some might be hardware and software limited in some way I‚Äôm not aware of, but then again, I‚Äôm not a Tesla engineer. This is coming from purely a user experience perspective. I‚Äôm probably missing some things, but feel free to add on.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/y2bwo8/things_i_wish_my_model_3_had/,Throwaway_4_u_know_y,9049.0,0.9813
TeslaMotors,problem,y78460,Basic Autopilot problems getting worse and worse by the update. Stop-and-go traffic basically unusable.,"I‚Äôve had my ‚Äô22 M3 RWD coming up on a year. It of course was always fully Vision Only with no radar. Over the past year, I had to wait for updates to get up to similar specs as the radar enabled cars: following distance, finally 85MPH, etc. Overall in the beginning, I didn‚Äôt have too many complaints with Autopilot. I didn‚Äôt have the phantom braking that many did. The only complaint I had early on was Autopilot drove too aggressively in stop-and-go traffic. Mainly it would fully accelerate up if the car in front just barely moved. It was so embarrassing I would never use it with guests in the car. I was able to work around that for the most part by lowering autopilot speed and changing to chill mode in those moments. Not ideal but it somewhat worked. I would do every software update in hopes it would fix it, like a lot of do. Fast forward to today. I down right refuse to use Autopilot in traffic because of how dangerous it is. It drives like a teenager learning to drive. It still does that full acceleration thing but now it slams on the brakes as soon as a car in front stops in stop-and-go traffic. And when I say the car in front stops, I don‚Äôt mean they slammed on their brakes, they were driving like a normal good driver would. I‚Äôve had two different times where the brake check my cars does causes the person behind me to almost hit me. Needing to swerve off to the side. I‚Äôm too fearful to use it for the day when a driver behind me is just a tad distracted and bam, accident.  My old tricks of speed, following distance, chill mode, don‚Äôt seem to matter as much. 

Is anyone else dealing with this shit? I keep hearing they are gonna combine the FSD stack and life will be bliss but I‚Äôm not holding my breath. Stop-and-go traffic is the true time Autopilot should shine but I‚Äôd honestly say that I‚Äôve driven in shittier competitors cars and they do a smoother job of it. Tesla really needs to get their head out of their asses and address things like this. I‚Äôve owned TSLA for a long time and followed the M3 since release. I feel we are reaching a critical time for the company with all the competition. It depresses me to say that right now, I might recommend others to look at different manufacturers for a car.

TeslaMotors,problem,vting2,CONFIRMED: Running the heat for at least an hour solves the problem of air conditioning smelling bad for many people.,"Like many other Tesla owners, I've been having problems with a sharp musty smell coming from my ventilation system over the summer.  

Two summers ago I paid Tesla to both change my cabin air filters and clean the A/C coils, which worked well.

This summer the smell came back, presumably due to bacteria growing on damp coils.

I decided to do an experiment and run the heat in my car for 4 hours, to see if that would completely dry out the coils, kill the bacteria, and eliminate the smell.  

It worked!

I talked to a Tesla mobile tech today and he said lots of his customers are doing the same thing and having success.  He suggested doing it while plugged in (if possible) and he mentioned that other people are setting their cars to do it overnight using the schedule feature.  He also said that most people are reporting that one hour of heat on high temperature is all we need.

For those who prefer to have Tesla replace their filters and clean the coils we can now request that service through the mobile app.  It is $140, which includes half an hour of labor and a can of one-time-use spray foam that the tech sprays onto the coils and lets sit for 10+ minutes. The foam then evaporates and leaves an anti-microbial coating.

EDIT:

When I did this I put the temperature on the highest setting, set the fan halfway (on manual), opened the windows, and put the car in ""keep"" mode.  I did not need to leave a door ajar or put anything on the front seat to trick the car into thinking I was there.

TeslaMotors,problem,nzu1zh,I feel like Tesla's communication around the Model S Plaid has been extremely dishonest.,"I feel like Tesla's communication around the Model S plaid has been extremely dishonest and I want to give some examples.

**0-60times LR vs Plaid**

 On tesla.com the 0-60 times are given as 3.1s for the LR and 1.99s for Plaid. *However* when you look at the fine print (and that only shows when clicking on feature details) you see that Tesla has ""With first foot of rollout subtracted"" but *only* for the Plaid making this an apples to oranges comparison.

If you were to also subtract rollout from the LR times the two numbers would actually be much closer, so Tesla is intentionally making the performance gap seem bigger than it is.

**The screen tilt**

Tesla advertises on the Model S pages that the center screen tilts but now it has come to light that this is something that is not available right now and supposedly comes in a software update. You cannot actually move the screen even manually. There was no mention anywhere that this feature will come later. 

And by knowing Tesla's timelines this might as well be 2 years away.

**""The car shifts by itself""**

Elon has tweeted a lot about how the car shifts itself and many news outlets reported on how you don't have to shift manually anymore. Now we know the car can only shift out of park by itself and this is also a **beta** feature, which is arguably one of Tesla's tricks to not have to claim liability.

You still have to shift gears to do 3 way turns or to park, using the onscreen shifter.

**The gaming capabilities**

The product page of the Model S shows the Witcher 3 and the event they demoed Cyberpunk. None of these games are in the car and there is no communication if or when they will be available.

The Product page also shows a game loaded on the rear screen. It is not possible to start games on the rear screen as of now.

**The Plaid+ cancelation**

""Plaid+ was canceled because Plaid is too good"", ""No one needs more than 400 miles"".

Both of these statements are quite dubious and it is clear that Tesla is hiding *something* here, maybe not enough orders or maybe problems with manufacturing the new cells.

I am a Tesla owner and generally very happy and still think that Tesla is the best EV manufacturer but I must say that I become increasingly frustrated with the stuff coming out of Elon's mouth because at this point I just have to stop believing everything he says.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/nzu1zh/i_feel_like_teslas_communication_around_the_model/,xdert,124256.0,-0.6701
TeslaMotors,problem,f2ayvn,Tesla needs to address their used car problem,"IMO every Tesla needs to have a list of which options it was purchased with and especially a current list of purchased software options searchable by VIN or available to view in a menu which makes it abundantly clear.

I've been in the market to buy a used Tesla for a few months and boy has it been painful.  Dealers have almost no idea what options are available much less which ones that are on that car.  I can usually get some idea from the posted pictures and can guide the seller to take a pic of some area of the car or the MCU to try to get the rest.  But some things are not knowable to my knowledge.  For example, I am hunting for a Model S.  There is no way that I know of to tell is the car has FSD purchased.  It looks identical to EAP in the menus.  Private sellers are usually more helpful but they almost never know if the car is going to retain it's FUSC status etc.

Then we get the recent story of the person that bought used with FSD only to have it removed shortly thereafter.  I've really lost confidence.  I don't know all the details of that story but it sure sounds like the dealer thought it has FSD, and the purchaser thought it had FSD... because at the time it did.  How the hell is it on there if it wasn't purchased for that VIN?  

I don't think this is a small thing.  It severely erodes confidence in buying used and greatly effects resale value for those who buy new.  I'll bet every wholesaler and auction buyer out there is second guessing buying a Tesla.  

I have some sympathy for the traditional dealers trying to understand the very different Tesla but boy are they really, really clueless.  Tesla is also no help.  I've tried calling with a VIN to no avail.  Maybe I'm doing it wrong but resellers don't know how to do it either.

TeslaMotors,problem,l8q4vj,"As an owner, I don't see how any owner can think Level 5 is anywhere close","Got my Model 3 in December. Paid for FSD and I don't regret it (yet). I love the car, better than anything I've driven in recent memory. Like the center screen, like the driving dynamics. Even like watching Netflix while waiting at the supercharger.

I was motivated to post this because the design of the new Model S/X seems to clearly indicate they don't actually think you'll need the steering wheel most of the time. That seems really really premature.

The existing Autopilot is not great, and I'm even starting to avoid using it out of fear of unexpected behavior. The FSD videos show similar behavior, even more unrefined, and applied in even more scenarios. Projecting forward, it's not getting better at a rate that will reach Level 5 anytime soon. At least 5 to 10 years I'd guess. ""FSD"" might get us to Level 3 if we're really lucky.

Problems:

- Phantom braking. So much of it. I drive mainly at night these days, and it now happens about once, sometimes twice every 20-40 minute drive. In the same very general section of highway, but not related to specific cars, bridges, or trucks as far as I can see. Could be any of those, or none, in some cases. Slamming on the brakes at 120 km/h in traffic is not great.
- Had it disengage mid off-ramp a few times and I had to grab the wheel to keep from slamming into a concrete barrier.
- It seems to deliberately and sometimes dramatically slow while overtaking cars in parallel lanes, causing the people behind me to slam on their brakes.
- Fast moving, but dense traffic seems to be the worst. It's not aggressive enough and confuses the people around me. Then will suddenly disengage or change speed, making the situation worse.
- Any time a lane closes or opens on a boulevard, it can't figure out where to go and swerves before disengaging.
- In moderate snow, without the Autopilot even engaged, the sensors go crazy, detecting every lump of snow on the road as an obstacle and sounding alarms constantly at speeds under 20km/h.
- Fully automated lane change is dangerous, usually wrong, erratic, and pointless.
- Not moving at the speed of traffic. Holding at 70km/h on long on-ramps for way too long, then attempting to get to 120km/h right at the end of the onramp.

If you watch FSD videos, some of this is improved, but a lot of it is not. It's mostly just the same kind of unreliable behavior in a wider array of situations.

The point of all of this is that it is not getting better very fast. And is bad enough now that I only really feel comfortable using it where I would have used cruise control in the past. Open highways, in a nearly straight line, with little traffic, and good weather. It's basically $10k cruise control. And when you add the nags, less automated than cruise control in some ways.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/l8q4vj/as_an_owner_i_dont_see_how_any_owner_can_think/,static416,16796.0,-0.9738
TeslaMotors,problem,no7ahx,Another no radar experience from someone who has driven both,"Picked up a no radar Model Y from Princeton yesterday.  Today I decided to travel down to Barnegat to visit family.  Might be a lengthy post, but the following is the experience with a no radar car.

To set the scene a little there was moderate to heavy rain.  It was by no means a downpour,  but closer to that than a drizzle.  Didn't start AP until I went on the parkway since it's only a couple miles away.  Almost immediately after engaging autopilot I got a notification saying something along the lines of autopilot speed reduced due to inclement weather.  I waited a while to see how low it would go, but eventually had to take over after it hit 54 or 55mph-ish.  Traveling 55 on the parkway is just dangerously slow even when it's raining so I had to take over.  I've taken this route many times in similar and even worse weather conditions and never had problems with my old Y.  I figured I would just use cruise control, but I guess I should have known since it only allows TaCC, it had problems with that as well.

So I go another 10 or so miles having to drive manually without even basic cruise control (I know first world problems).   At this point the rain briefly stopped completely, so I tried it again.  It ended up being a double whammy of sorts.  First I got a phantom brake event when I went under a double overpass and immediately after there was a merge.  I wouldn't think it would be from the overpasses since my understanding is radar was rumored to cause that by bouncing up into them and misinterpreting it for a car.  It also unfortunately cannot be explained by the merging cars though or really anything else since they were no where near me and I wasn't even in the right lane.  Shortly after that, while it is still not raining mind you I again got the limited speed warning I'm assuming from the other cars kicking up the rain driving to the side of me.  At this point I just went the rest of the way manually.  Even when driving manually I got an alert stating forward collision warning when I was nowhere near anybody, not once, but twice.  The Tesla went from the best car to drive a long distance on the freeway to a worse experience than my old Honda since at least that could use cruise control.

&#x200B;

On the way back it was even worse though.  It was about 3AM and the auto high beams were flashing on and off at almost every sign.  I assume the reflection of light from the highly reflective signs were confusing it.  I thought no problem, this is why I disabled auto high beams on the old one.  I press forward to turn high beams off.  I immediately get a notice saying they need to be on for autopilot.  It now requires auto high beams to use autopilot.  I turn them back on and just say I'll look like a goof with them constantly turning on and off.  There weren't all that many people out there at this time anyway.  I'm driving along and it was getting closer to another vehicle than I was comfortable with with high beams on.  I also didn't want them to think I was road raging on them since they kept flashing on and off due to the signs.  So again I just decide I'll use cruise control and again I find out I can't even use that without auto high beams.  So yet again I'm manually driving the car having a less pleasant experience than my old Honda.

&#x200B;

Again I came from and still technically have an old Model Y with radar.  The only reason I even ""upgraded"" is I was lucky to have reserved one while it was $49k thinking maybe if a tax incentive passes I could upgrade and end up only paying a little.  When they said they had one ready I checked Vroom and for some reason they offered $51k, so it was kinda a no brainer even if the bill doesn't pass that says any cars after May 24th.

Either way, it was unequivocally a worse experience than my old one, and it wasn't even particularly close.  Still hope much of it can be fixed with updates, but at this point not only is it almost unusable in the rain, it's almost unusable in areas in which it had previously rained and there are other cars near you.  This last point is likely just me being too nervous I'm pissing off other drivers, it may not well of even been bothering anybody, but at least for me, and at least based on this experience, it's not even usable at night... at all.

TL;DR: Based on my admittedly limited experience, and at least for now, the non-radar versions are significantly worse.  In multiple ways, not just weather.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit: Wow, this kinda blew up.  I probably shouldn't have had it email me on posts as it kinda filled my inbox.  Saw some questions, super busy, and there's a reason I'm going back and forth at times like 3AM, but will try to answer a few questions later.

One I just saw asked if I had video of it, which unfortunately I don't as I was alone.  I probably shouldn't have taken them, but I do have a few pictures.  I was trying to get a picture of one of the random ""forward collision warning"" notices on screen, but was unable to get it before it disappeared.  This does show a very rough idea of what the weather was like and as can be seen in the photo at this point it was no longer even giving the option for autopilot as can be seen by no wheel icon.

Edit 2:  Just noticed in the pictures it actually seems to still see things fine based on the visualizations, so maybe there's still hope some/much can be fixed in software?  Perhaps I'm just being to optimistic though.

&#x200B;

Edit 3: Already have a new update downloading.  Although I obviously don't expect it to fix everything, it is ever so slightly reassuring to see they seem to be trying to belt them out.  2021.4.18.1.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/no7ahx/another_no_radar_experience_from_someone_who_has/,cyanidmako,2900.0,-0.9667
TeslaMotors,problem,gzzj5h,I returned my Model Y back to Tesla - Full Story/Details,"I have been hesitant to post my experience on this subreddit, but ultimately decided this information should be shared with the community. I have added some more details from another post to help outline the facts.

As the title states I returned my Model Y PUP back to Tesla Monday. This was mainly due to safety concerns and poor customer service. I will try and keep my recap short, but there are several items to cover...

I took delivery Friday June 5th in Kansas City (Delivery Center that was assigned). On my way home to Oklahoma City, about half way, I heard some noise from under the car. I pulled over to find the front aero piece hanging down and not attached. I see that I am a mile from a Casino parking lot (in the middle of nowhere Kansas) and decide to limp it there to evaluate further. That mile I could hear terrible noises coming from the front, but I didn't want to be on the shoulder of the interstate dealing with this, so I slowly made it to that parking lot. I call Tesla Roadside and am given the option to drive it back to Kansas City for service or have it towed. They tell me that the towing option would be covered only if the issue is deemed to be a warranty item. If they find its a warranty item I can work on being reimbursed. At this point I had the car for 48 hours and driven 250 miles. I had not hit anything or gone over any rough terrain. I felt confident that this would be a warranty issue. So, in order to avoid any further damage to the vehicle, I opted for the tow and thought I would get this worked out at the service center.¬†

I had it towed to the Kansas City service center Sunday night. An interesting point to note is that there was miscommunication with the tow truck company, and the tow truck driver was told that Tesla paid for the tow in full, so I wouldn't have to sign anything or pay. I asked the driver a few times to confirm, and figured maybe if they find that it wasn't a warranty issue they add it to my service invoice (my first Tesla and Service Experience).

The next day (Monday) after finding accommodations in Kansas City for the night, I arrived at the service center in the morning to make sure everything was handled. Explained what happened, they apologize profusely and say they will take a look. After letting them work on it for a few hours, I hear nothing, but since I don‚Äôt live in Kansas City and have nothing to do, I decide to wait at the Tesla center. My advisor comes out and says the car is ready to drive, but since they don‚Äôt have parts they have just secured it to be ‚Äúdriveable.‚Äù No estimates on when they can get parts (I expected that) and we would address it as soon as they are available. He then tells me this absolutely is covered under warranty because the bolts were not secured properly and it wasn‚Äôt done right at the factory. So, I am glad to hear this, but seriously concerned by the oversight. My advisor then tells me I am responsible for the $1,100 tow truck bill. I am initially confused because the car could not be driven without causing more damage. I wasn‚Äôt close to any store where I could buy supplies to tape it up, and I don‚Äôt want to be blamed for more damage. They tell me I can contact Tesla corporate myself and plead my case, but not to expect much. Disappointed about this outcome, I decide to leave the store to try and get some answers from corporate. I spend the next hour trying to get through to a real person which shockingly is more difficult than I thought it would be. I was only able to get a hold of someone by using roadside assistance. I tell the situation to the agent and the agent confirms that ‚Äúif the repair was covered under warranty then the tow should be included in that claim‚Äù. So basically this issue is with the service center and not corporate according to them.

So my 3rd trip to the service center starts with them completely agreeing that this is a warranty repair. I then tell him that Tesla customer service on the phone said that if it‚Äôs a warranty repair then the towing should be covered. He agrees, but says management won‚Äôt budge. I say I will need this to be resolved because this is my 3rd trip here and the tow truck driver is calling my phone for payment. After a long back room discussion they tell me Tesla WILL pay for it, they just don‚Äôt know if the Service Department or Roadside Assistance group will be paying it. I also find out the long delays are because all of this is being done by email... They don't have a number to call someone about it. That seems like an impossible way to get anything done in a timely manner, but that what I was told...

At this point I am upset that this has been so difficult and wasted my entire day, and being an out of town customer looks like it will be a nightmare. I was only able to get this far because I stayed in Kansas City an extra night and took off work. I tell them I am returning the car and want to start that process. I think they were shocked and I was told this was the first time any customer had done this (at their location). I loved the car, I love Tesla and still do. I just can‚Äôt deal with this type of stuff in the future. I can update everyone on the return process as it continues. All they had me do Monday was sign a ‚ÄúReturn Declaration‚Äù and hand them the keys.

Haven't heard a word from anyone else at Tesla since yesterday at the store. I just hoping to get some confirmation that my refund is in process.

TL;DR - I bought a Tesla Model Y 2 days ago. A manufacturing defect caused me to be stuck 2 1/2 hours from home. Tesla covered the repair under warranty but refused to pay the $1,100 tow truck bill. With some of the delivery issues, this warranty repair, and the terrible customer service it made me rethink this purchase and I walked away. Still like Tesla, but will wait until things are more ironed out.

Some Clarifications

\- the ""aero piece"" is different than the Model 3, it is a hard plastic cover. Some have commented that its just a fabric. On my car it would drag and flap wildly hitting underneath anytime I went over 30 MPH.

\- My biggest concern was voiding the warranty. I could Uber 20 miles to get some tape or remove it. However, I was unable to get any confirmation from Tesla that if I proceed with taping/removing it that it wouldn't void my warranty.- I didn't really return it due to the failure, it was more from how difficult it was to get a hold of anyone at Tesla and discuss the issue. Living in a state that does not have any Tesla locations made me realize that if I had a problem it might be a difficult thing to resolve.

\- My comment about loving Tesla comes from all the things they are trying to accomplish. The car had very little issues (no more than any other new car I had purchased). I know there are some that are in terrible shape and there is no excuse for that. The car was great, and amazing to drive. They really just lost me on the on going support.¬†

&#x200B;

Edit: Some have asked for proof -  [https://imgur.com/a/LvHqk82](https://imgur.com/a/LvHqk82) \- This is the return document signed. It is not an early build for anyone tracking the VINs. The door listed a production date of May 2020, post factory shutdown.

Edit 2: A picture of the damage and panel -  [https://imgur.com/a/gLoZkms](https://imgur.com/a/gLoZkms)  \- The wind would catch this panel and it would hit the car and drag on the ground. My understanding is that the Model Y has a slightly different part than the older Model 3's that were using a fabric composite. I was not close to a store to complete my own repair, and no way to get a hold of Tesla and confirm my own temporary repair wouldn't void the warranty. Regardless, I was disappointed this part wasn't secured properly at delivery. I did not hit anything, you can see the front lip and the rest of the underside has not scrapes or damage.

Update 1: Just had a call with a Tesla employee at the Kansas City location. He confirmed that my return is in process and I should expect funds back in 15-20 days. He was very nice and professional, but couldn't offer any more information on if my situation will be reviewed by Customer Service leaders at the company.

TeslaMotors,problem,y3bg89,"As a non-Tesla EV owner, I now get it!","I get it.  I now understand why so many people are emphatically over the moon with their Tesla. I myself drive an Audi e-tron and my wife drives a Volvo XC60 PHEV, but over the past week we drove a Model Y Long Range over 850 miles while on vacation. We drove it in downtown urban areas, suburbs, on the interstate, on back country roads, a National Park, and even an international border. After driving the car for a week in many different types of driving scenarios, I can confidently say driving a Tesla is the most complete EV experience currently on the market. The key word here is EV, as the majority of my dislikes stem around the car part of the Y we rented. The EV/Software part of the Y was nearly a full chef's kiss. The only thing that really left a bad taste in my mouth was a few aspects of the auto-pilot (AP) system.

Things I loved:

* Plug and charge
* In car route planning with charging
* Showing how many spots were open at a Super Charger
* One pedal driving
* Amazing efficiency
* AP can find and maintain a lane like no other system I've used

Things that were neat:

* The slight delay before regen kicked in when coming off AP, giving you enough time to get your foot on the accelerator.
* The speed limit recognition system automatically converting KPH to MPH when driving into Canada.
* The charge door opening when pressing the button on the charger handle
* Being able to watch a Hulu show while waiting to board a car ferry.

Things I didn't really care for but wasn't a big deal

* The two step door handles were a little annoying
* The driving info on the left side of the screen was a little gimmicky. I would have preferred to have a full screen map then an animation of a semi-truck that was actually a car pulling a trailer.
* The vegan leather looked and felt cheap but the seats were ultimately comfortable to sit in for hours which is really what is important.
* No real-time visualization of traffic along the route. I'm fairly certain traffic was taken into account when route planning, but there is no indication I could find to show it on the map. Ultimately not a big deal since it really did seem like traffic was taken into account when creating a route.

Things I really didn't like

* The suspension is subpar. The Y really needs better suspension and maybe even an air suspension system. Once the roads start to get a little rough, the suspension really started to show its faults. It was fine on smooth roads though.
* Road noise is a problem. It gets loud in the cabin over 60 mph, especially if the road is not perfectly smooth.
* There were various squeaks and creaks when going over bumps and on rough roads.
* Looking at the map while driving was a bit of a neck stretch. Like I said before, it would have been nice to have a full screen map or at least have it positioned closer to the driver.
* There is no cruise control speed memory past being able to automatically set it at the speed limit (or X% past the speed limit)
* The torque sensor for AP is not very sensitive. Our Audi is capacitive but the Volvo uses a torque sensor and only takes the slightly nudge to recognize an input. I could wiggle the Y's steering wheel and nothing. I ended up just flicking the volume up and down in these cases which was a little annoying.

Things that drove me bonkers

* Adaptive cruise control is way too sensitive. I only had one phantom braking instance but there were many times I would pass a parked car, a cyclist, a runner, a car turning left in front of me, and a few other things that would trigger a panic brake scenario. Our Audi and Volvo do not have this problem.
* No blind spot monitoring system. I found Tesla's solution to blind spots more effort and increased the amount of time when my eyes were off the road. Almost every other manufacturer has a light on the mirror which lets you quickly look in your mirror and see if someone is in your blind spot simultaneously. It's a two step process in a Tesla and I found myself manually checking my blind spots in heavy traffic situations.
* AP disabling every single time I changed lanes. In moderate traffic, this became a nuisance every time I moved into the left lane to pass someone.
* Auto high beams when AP was enabled. I ended up blinding a bunch of people because this system is not up to snuff. Our Audi and Volvo do not have this problem. I eventually just turned AP off after getting flashed multiple times by oncoming cars.
* AP is an all or nothing system. It's great at maintaining your lane, but in the rare instance it didn't,  I wish the system would let you make a small correction instead of disabling altogether. It was very jerky and would fight me in those situations. It just didn't feel safe.

I do want to touch on AP one more time as I was blown away by how well it would maintain a lane. It didn't matter if it was a construction zone with a temporary lane made of cones or a twisty mountain road full of switch backs. The darn car would stay in the center of the lane and handle almost any turn no matter how tight. It truly is next level in this aspect. The big problem I had with AP was the ancillary systems around it that made the experience like monitoring a toddler. Frankly, AP is much more advanced than Audi or Volvo's system but the latter systems are so much more relaxing to use, especially on the interstate where lane markings are generally good.

Alright. If you have read this far you're probably thinking I hate the vehicle after how much complaining I did but that truly isn't the case. The things that made the Y great were weighted much higher than what wasn't so great. Point being, the EV/Software aspects of the car are so polished that I get how people are willing to overlook some of the things Tesla doesn't do well with. Would I buy one? IDK. Maybe. It's hard to say since we already have two nice cars, but at the very least I get what the hype is about. I'm also having a hard time adjusting to not having one pedal driving on my e-tron after spending a week with the Tesla so there is that. :)

TeslaMotors,problem,dykfb1,M3 suddenly died while driving. Terrible 1st experience with roadside assistance.,"So yesterday I had just started driving away from my house, not even a half mile away, when suddenly I heard a bang/pop sound and my car slowed to a stop, saying ‚Äòlost power‚Äô ‚Äòcan not drive‚Äô etc. Roadside assistance texted shortly after to let me know I needed to be towed and someone would be there within 90 minutes. This was already bad, as I was on a busy street and couldn‚Äôt move the car at all. After about an hour I checked in again via text and they said the 1st tow company cancelled the request and didn‚Äôt tell them so they would send someone else which would be another hour! By the time that truck arrived, I had been sitting there for 2+ hours and the car had totally run out of 12V and the flashers had stopped working and it was dark. Just as rush hour was heating up. Kind of a stressful situation.

Then things went from bad to worse, as the tow driver didn‚Äôt know how to jump the car, and I couldn‚Äôt get through to roadside assistance OR the service center. We ended up having to get it on the flatbed without engaging towing mode. Windows were stuck down, etc.

Long story short, I was sitting in the side of the road for over 4 hours, unable to get help from anyone at Tesla. I finally had to Uber myself to the service center ahead of the car as it was almost closing time and I needed to try to get a loaner. Thankfully I did, and I then sat there for another hour until the truck showed up.

All told it took about 6 hours to get towed to the service center 7 miles away. Horrible communication, horrible experience.

I just hope whatever is wrong with my car won‚Äôt be as complicated to fix. I‚Äôm so grateful this didn‚Äôt happen with my kids in the car or on an expressway.

My last attempts at communication with the roadside assistance text number: https://imgur.com/a/M248JZL

EDIT: As I wrote in one of the comments below: one of the many, many problems here was that **even after jumping the little terminals behind the tow hook cover, the frunk never opened itself**.

EDIT 2: I just wrote this post to chronicle my experience and vent a little. I honestly did not think anyone would read it or care. But since it's gotten a lot of visibility, a few thoughts/takeaways from the discussion:

- This situation was ultimately the result of many failures piled on top of each other. A total cluster if you will.

- I did read the manual when I first got the car and I knew about towing mode. I also knew that towing mode would only stay engaged for a short time. The problem was that I had no idea when the truck was going to show up! By the time it did, the 12V was dead. We tried to jump the terminals by the tow hook, but then the frunk did not open. If a truck had gotten on the scene within a few hours, this whole situation probably would have been MUCH less complicated.

- It's true that 3rd party tow companies are not Tesla, but ultimately this is TESLA's Roadside Assistance program, and it is Tesla's responsibility to train and contract competent providers. After their 1st contractor cancelled without notice, the driver that eventually showed up had no idea about jumping the car, and then spent almost 2 hours figuring out how to strap the wheels down.

- If a vehicle is covered under 'Roadside Assistance', the channels of communication at Tesla need to be much more open and responsive in a scenario where a vehicle is stranded. I can't tell you how frustrating it was to get zero response at the service center or text support as the tow driver was cluelessly fumbling about. I tried calling every number I could find. The mothership knew the vehicle was FUBAR'd and had been for hours. In that scenario, Roadside should call or at least provide a phone number you can call and reach someone.

EDIT 3: **Got an update from the Service Center. Apparently an internal failure within the rear drive unit caused the pyro fuse to blow. A new drive unit has been ordered and should be arriving soon.**

Also, some more details for those asking:

- This is a LR RWD, built in Oct '18. ~7,800 miles
- The car had an 80% charge at the time.
- Software version was 36.2.1
- Weather at the time was about 40F. No precipitation.

EDIT 4: Got the car back today (12/3/19), just over two weeks since the incident. Most of that time was waiting on the new drive unit (980 Rev F). DU and pyro fuse were replaced, coolant purged and firmware updated. Took about 2 days once the parts were in. Very happy to be back in my 3.

And I don't know what is going on, but the situation with the Superchargers just got extremely worse (than a couple of months ago). Some charging stations are not working at all; some are only working at really slow speed (20kW max) and so on.

Wtf? I'm stuck with two kids in my car now, one of them has diabetes T1, it's dark at 8:40 pm here, we need to wait a lot more to charge our battery and drive two more hours to get to the hotel. It's the worst experience that I've ever had traveling in the car. Yes, perhaps I'm exaggerating because I'm pissed off. But seriously Tesla, your charging station are vital centers, you really must to follow up and repair them asap. 

I know that people like to hear nice things about Tesla, I know that I'll get lots of downvotes here, but this is not good. Maybe it makes sense to add some report a ""supercharger failure"" button in Teslas or something like that?

TeslaMotors,problem,c9fpgv,How the Tesla Model 3 has Ruined Me,"&#x200B;

[Supercharging on the Way Home](https://preview.redd.it/uy11zpftgh831.jpg?width=4160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3947e75dfd6c0767121845235a5973ed8e72ea2e)

In November last year I took delivery of my black, rear wheel drive, long range Tesla Model 3. I‚Äôd never driven in a Tesla before, much less driven one myself. Still, the lure of a 300+ mile range fully electric vehicle and the soon to be cut in half Federal tax credit swayed me and my wife to take the plunge. Six or so months and 11,000 miles later, the car has more or less ruined me on driving any other vehicle. The Model 3 does things that feel groundbreaking and paradigm shifting, and, even more amazingly, in a, ‚ÄúWhy hasn‚Äôt it always been this way,‚Äù sort of way.

1. Entry, exit, and control of the vehicle through the app is pretty much flawless (note: with a modern phone) and doesn't require a dedicated device. Walking up to the car with your enabled smartphone means getting in is as simple as pulling on the handle. Other cars have similar behaviors with key fobs, but who wants to carry anything else around when I already have a computer with all sorts of connectivity options sitting in my pocket? This is what Tesla has done; eliminated something I used to have to carry around. The funny thing is I never really thought much about carrying keys around until I didn‚Äôt have to do so anymore. Now that I don‚Äôt have to carry keys, when I drive my wife‚Äôs car I‚Äôm very aware that I have this other device in my pocket.
2. The acceleration is effortless, silent, and addicting. Seriously addicting. I came to the Tesla from an economy sedan, so the difference for me is greater than someone who may have had another performance luxury vehicle, but oh my God is the acceleration just lovely. Even better, it‚Äôs all so effortless. When I get in another vehicle now and put the pedal down it feels like everything is just working so hard to achieve what the Tesla does instantaneously and with almost no noise (just an appealing motor whine that reminds me of the Tumbler in stealth mode in the Nolan lead Batman series). When someone in a traditionally powered vehicle drives past with their engine roaring, it feels like such an anachronism now.
3. The entire braking system does things the right way. The magnetic braking means I typically only have to use my physical brakes at somewhere between 4 and 6 MPH to come to a complete stop, instead of braking the vehicle all the way down from 60 or 65 MPH, which will clearly create far more wear on the braking system. The magnetic braking was the thing I was most nervous about initially, having read stories of people coming to jerky stops when getting used to it. Those fears were entirely unfounded. Except for my first toll booth stop (which was hilariously about 15 feet too soon), I‚Äôve found it entirely intuitive and easy to get used to. Now, when I drive a different car and take my foot off the accelerator I‚Äôm cranky about the fact that I have to push the stupid brake pedal down (what is this, the 50s?) to really slow the car, instead of the car just doing it automatically.
4. Speaking of annoying things you just do in your car without thinking about it, how about turning the car on and off? The Tesla system to turn the car on (you really don't, but you get it ready to go by pushing the brake pedal with your phone in your pocket) and turn it off (you really don‚Äôt, just open the door) doesn‚Äôt need to be a Tesla only thing. Any car with a key fob could do both of these things, really. Why do they require me to push a different button? Speaking of that, the fact that the Tesla automatically locks the doors when you get out of range takes a little getting used to (there‚Äôs initially a fear it won‚Äôt work) but once you do it‚Äôs another one of those little things that all cars should just do, but for some reason don‚Äôt. Note, however, that getting used to this stuff means you‚Äôll probably leave your other cars running accidentally. My wife has caught me just hopping out of our other car a few times without shutting it off. Sorry, I thought this was 2019.
5. The minimal gauges was something I loved from the moment I sat in the car for the first time. It took about 10 minutes to get used to looking slightly right instead of slightly down for my speed, and (admittedly) about a week to get used to the lane obstacle detection in the same location, but it‚Äôs all so clean and tidy. The internal navigation is fantastic (and the 3D perspective it gives is a nice touch), and the infotainment system works well (generally). I was initially worried I‚Äôd hate not having SiriusXM (and honestly, I still think for this level of car it should be an option), but I ended up cancelling my app-based Sirius subscription about 2 months after getting the car because there are a ton of options built in for free. Getting into a more typical car now feels like information overload, with dozens of dials, gauges, and buttons competing for my attention, and LED light coming from every direction. Driving the Model 3, in particular at night, feels far more connected with the outside world because of the minimal distractions within the cabin.
6. What does gas cost right now? I honestly don‚Äôt know, but up until November I‚Äôd always had a sense of what it cost per gallon, because I was filling up every 6 days. Even better, my wife barely has to fill up more than once a month because on the weekends we pile all five of us into my car for basically every drive (us plus our three daughters). Our other vehicle (a Pacifica) is relegated to times where we both need to go somewhere or we‚Äôre driving a long enough distance that having three kids in the back is going to lead to arguments. Otherwise, even though the kids clearly have significantly more space in the minivan, they always want to drive in the Tesla. This gets me to another reason this car has ruined me on other cars. Sure, I need to charge, but I just plug in when I get home, and I head in to the house. No more freezing while pumping gas in the middle of February. Sure, I lost approximately 25% range in the Winter months due to the cold, but that‚Äôs not much of a problem when you can ‚Äúfill up‚Äù every night (scheduled to use off-peak electric prices) if you‚Äôre worried about your range, and the car is filling up while I‚Äôm reading, hanging out with the wife and kids, or sleeping.
7. How about service? I had a minor squeaking coming from the back wheels when reversing (common problem) and my horn would only sound when I pushed the right hand side (again, common). I scheduled service within the app for the nearest location, and then Tesla sent a message a few days later saying that these issues could be addressed by their mobile service system, so they drove to my house and did everything in my driveway. I didn‚Äôt need to go to some shop, sit in their waiting room for who knows how long, try to work using their wifi, etc. I just hung out at my house, doing what I usually would, and they fixed the two issues. Awesome.
8. Software updates are flawless and fast. You get notified on your phone that an update is available, click to start the update process, and then a little later get notified that the update is complete. By comparison, software updates in our Pacifica created a situation where climate control was broken for a month while they figured out what went wrong, and updating my old car required me to download images to a flash drive and sit with the car running for an hour while the update was applied. Updates are also super frequent and not insignificant in what they‚Äôre doing, including things like adding 5% more range to the car and better power (as if that was really necessary).

To be objective, however, there are some annoyances:

1. Voice control is still pretty limited. My 2012 Ford had better voice control options (voice and phrase detection was far worse in that car, which is pretty much flawless in the Tesla, but there were more phrases it would recognize), including some that I think are absolutely necessary, like, ‚ÄúCall Sarah on mobile.‚Äù Right now in the Tesla I can only say, ‚ÄúCall Sarah,‚Äù and it lists all the numbers I have for her in my contacts, which requires me to scroll to find the right one and tap on it on the display.
2. Speaking of phone control, the pick up / hang up options should be able to be ‚Äútapped‚Äù through the steering wheel buttons.
3. Cell connectivity sometimes just flakes out for the in-car infotainment. I park underground at work, so the car won‚Äôt have LTE coverage in the garage, but it also seems to just lose the ability to reconnect when I come back up above ground (probably weekly). A couple of times a month it seems to require a soft reboot to get it to reconnect to LTE.
4. The piano black plastic covers for the center console area are scratch and dust magnets. I tried to wrap them but messed it up the first time so I haven‚Äôt tried again. Still, for an expensive car I‚Äôd think they‚Äôd have a nicer setup in such a prominent area. It‚Äôs pretty clear this is a common complaint when center console wraps are such a common purchase for Model 3 owners.

Two other points worth mentioning quickly:

1. This car is more contagious than a yawn at the DMV. A friend and my parents both bought Model 3s after driving in mine basically once. It‚Äôs that nice. It‚Äôs that different.
2. I recently got back from a 3.5 hour drive in our other car (family vacation), and I immediately volunteered to go get groceries, just so I could drive the Tesla. Usually the last thing I‚Äôd want to do is drive more after a long drive. Instead, it just highlighted the advantages of the Tesla.

So, that‚Äôs it at a high level. The Model 3 has ruined me on other cars, and it has done so by concentrating on the everyday aspects of car driving. In the Kano model, it has basically added delighters and performance features that everyone else is just checking the box on. It takes a lot of things we just take for granted as ‚Äúthe way it‚Äôs done,‚Äù and reimagined them in a way that feels like it‚Äôs redefining what driving should be in the 21st century.

TeslaMotors,problem,xehfbl,Tesla assigned my Model 3 to some random person in Europe,"Maybe you‚Äôve heard of me. I‚Äôm the guy who managed to [reverse-engineer the Tesla Key Cards](https://gist.github.com/darconeous/2cd2de11148e3a75685940158bddf933) that are used on the Model 3 and Model Y. But that‚Äôs not what this post is about.

This is the story about how Tesla accidentally assigned my vehicle to some random person ‚Äúin Europe‚Äù, giving them the ability to remotely control various aspects of my vehicle‚Äîeven the garage door to¬† my home‚Äîwithout my knowledge or consent.

It started a few days ago, when my partner told me that the garage door was open and I walked out to investigate. This seemed strange: I didn‚Äôt remember opening the garage door. ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôm just being forgetful?‚Äù, I thought to myself.

A little later in the day, my partner told me that our Tesla Model 3 had been acting strangely. When walking up to the car, she would notice the trunk and frunk open, and the AC blowing at full blast. After closing both, she said they opened again a short while later. At this point I was a little more concerned, but I was quite busy with work and didn‚Äôt have time to investigate.

When I did finally get around to looking into it, the vehicle was already taken by another family member to run an errand. Concerned that my account might have been hacked, I logged into my Tesla account on the website to see what might be going on.

Nothing. My car was gone.

Now very concerned, I checked the Tesla app on my phone. For a moment I saw a brief flash of the picture of my car, which was immediately replaced with options to look into new vehicles to purchase. My car was gone.

I then checked the Tesla app on my partner‚Äôs phone. Again: My car was gone.

My mind raced. Had my account been hacked? That seemed implausible. My passwords are high-entropy and unique per account. Had the guys at Costco changing my tires somehow figured out a way to override my account? That seemed implausible too, but‚Ä¶maybe? Was my vehicle being stolen right now? Clearly, someone else knew where the car was, maybe they were just waiting for it to be left in a public parking lot before making their move? I texted the family member to check if the vehicle was still where she parked it and that all the doors, trunk, and frunk were still locked.

I then urgently searched for Tesla‚Äôs customer service phone number, which is surprisingly difficult to find on their website when stressed out about¬† your vehicle no longer being under your control. Google came to the rescue: 1 (888) 518-3752

I luckily got a human on the line relatively quickly. I explained the situation, told her my account info. She then asked for the last six digits of the VIN. After nervously scraping around the filing cabinet, I found a document with the VIN and gave her the digits. She then asked me to read it back to her.

Her responses after this point started to sound puzzled. She asked for the full VIN. Then after a few moments of typing, she said she needed to escalate to her manager to address this problem. Hmmm‚Ä¶

About fifteen minutes of hold-music later, she came back and asked if I had the car in my possession. After confirming that I indeed had not sold or given away my vehicle, she asked me what color it was. After responding, she went back on hold. I was puzzled. I guess my account wasn‚Äôt hacked? But what had happened?

A few minutes later she came back. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Mr. Quattlebaum, but it appears that one of our employees in Europe entered the wrong VIN when updating the system about the sale of another vehicle. The wrong VIN they entered was the VIN for your vehicle‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù, I exclaimed in suprise, completely oblivious to my son being nearby.

‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs pretty bad. We are going to move the vehicle back over to your account and open an investigation into how this happened‚Äù

I was dumbfounded. Someone ‚Äúin Europe‚Äù had bought a used Tesla, and then went on to transfer the vehicle to their Tesla account‚Äîexcept the VIN that was used was the VIN for \*my\* vehicle. Never mind that my vehicle is clearly nowhere in Europe, or that it doesn‚Äôt even have a compatible charging port for European chargers.

They just handed control of my vehicle over to some random person, no questions asked. Theoretically, had this random person been in proximity to my vehicle, they could have opened it, started it, and driven away with it. Not that this was a real concern, but still.

In case you were wondering, here is a list of the things that someone can do remotely on a Tesla vehicle if that vehicle is in their account:

* Lock/Unlock the doors.
* Roll down the windows.
* Open the trunk and frunk.
* Control the climate control.
* Honk the horn.
* Flash the lights.
* Start the vehicle, so that it may be driven.
* Give other accounts control of the vehicle.
* Change the charge limit.
* Prevent charging entirely.
* Open nearby linked garage doors.
* See the location of the vehicle.
* Summon the vehicle, making it move if it is not connected to a charging cable (although the app would likely have prevented this).

Had we been dependent on using the phone key feature, we would not have been able to open or start the vehicle. Luckily, all drivers for the vehicle have that feature turned off and only use NFC keys, which were unaffected.

Once the vehicle was transferred to their account, this random person proceeded to remotely open the trunk, frunk, change the climate controls, change the charge limit, and even the garage door to my home, multiple times throughout the day. I sincerely doubt they had any idea the chaos they were causing: I'm sure they were confused about why they couldn't open their frunk from the app.

‚ÄúSo the vehicle is now back in my account?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes sir, and we‚Äôve opened an investigation into how this happened‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd the Motor Vehicle Purchase Agreement, that‚Äôs back on my account, too?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, of course‚Äù

And a little bit later, while trying to work out the details of how to get the car back onto my partner‚Äôs account, the phone went silent. Didn‚Äôt disconnect, just went silent. After several minutes of waiting, I hung up.

I went to the Tesla website and finally I could see my Model 3 back on my account. Phew. Then I went to check the ‚Äúglovebox‚Äù to see if my Motor Vehicle Purchase Agreement (MVPA) was still there.

**EDIT3**: u/Doctor_McKay pointed out that the MVPA was likely still in my account, now under ""previously owned vehicles"". Turns out that's exactly where it went. Thanks for the advice!

~~It was gone.~~

~~You might be wondering why this is important. This is important because I had purchased the ‚ÄúFull Self Driving‚Äù (FSD) package, and the MVPA proved that I had made that purchase. However, shortly after taking possession of my vehicle it no longer had the additional features that came exclusively with the FSD package. I had tried to get Tesla to fix this in the past (they even upgraded my FSD computer for free because they saw I had purchased FSD on the MVPA), but they never actually enabled it in the vehicle. I had been meaning to call them up at some point to complain again to get them to honor the MVPA, which was conveniently right there on my account for them to read‚Äîbut life is busy and I kept pushing it back. Besides, the MVPA wasn‚Äôt going anywhere, right?~~

~~Little did I know that Tesla was going to hijack my vehicle from my account, deleteing the MVPA from it in the process. Now I feared I was going to have to prove that I made the FSD purchase instead of them just looking at the MVPA and acknowledging the mistake.~~

I digress.

This was, as they say, a complete clusterfuck. I‚Äôm left feeling somewhat violated and shaken by the fact that this was even possible without physical possession of the vehicle or my participation.

But perhaps that‚Äôs on me: I‚Äôm a software engineer, I know how this stuff works. My ownership of the vehicle is just a line in their database to reassign at-will. There are no safeguards or cryptographic verifications that would require proof of physical possession before changing that line. All Tesla owners are just a fat-finger away from losing the ability to remotely monitor and control their vehicle.

If it happened to me, it could happen to you.

**EDIT2:** Made it more clear that the family member to took the Tesla to run errands was not the same person as ""my partner"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/xehfbl/tesla_assigned_my_model_3_to_some_random_person/,darconeous,2972.0,-0.972
TeslaMotors,problem,e6akgt,Tesla has a parts problem - Can't get my Model 3 repaired,"Tesla has a serious problem with parts for repairs and associated customer service. I have had a Model 3 since March 2019.  Until recently it has been a fantastic experience.  So much so that I have helped sell one M3 to a friend almost have another one ready to pull the trigger, and have given countless test drives.  In mid October I noticed that both my key cards had stopped working. I usually use my phone key for entry so not an immediate problem. I set up my first mobile service for Oct 29th. On Oct 24th I got a text from Tesla saying the were canceling my service appointment because they did not have the parts they needed(I guess they remotely diagnosed my car?). They also said that they would monitor the parts and reschedule my appointment.  I figure no big deal I have my phone.  Its Dec 4th now and even though I have heard from Tesla twice stating they still don't have parts, have made known my annoyance with this unreasonable delay, my car is not fixed.  I am starting to get annoyed. My experience as whole is starting to be tainted by this issue. The icing on the cake is that today I bought a new phone.  Guess what? You can't enroll a new phone as a phone key without using a key card(as far as I know).  Great, so now I have two choices:  

1) Don't use my new phone and continue to use my old phone or 

2) use my new phone but only have the ability to open/lock/start the car via the app, putting me at risk for being stranded in the case that I park in some place that does not have cell coverage(like a below ground parking garage) and being annoyed at how long it takes to unlock the car with the app due to the latency of the using the internet..etc. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to fix this or get Tesla to fix my car?  Thinking I will reach out to a lawyer soon and see what my options are.

Update 12/5: I just made another mobile appt with the app. Got a Dec 23rd appt time.  Replied to the confirmation text that I wanted an earlier appt b/c I had been dealing w/ this since Oct and did not want to be stranded. They replied w/ a Dec 11th appt and confirmed availability of the parts. I can live w/ Dec 11th I guess. It's better than not know when at all. Fingers crossed.

Update 12/11: Tesla Mobile came today and replaced my ""Security Module"".  All is good now!",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/e6akgt/tesla_has_a_parts_problem_cant_get_my_model_3/,notimprssed,266.0,0.8492
TeslaMotors,problem,q15194,I swear you all had me worried about service...,"So my month old Model 3 had an issue where the front-right camera went black which disables autopilot.  After reading all the negative service experiences I went into the app and scheduled service with some real dread.

Day before rolls around and I get a text from Tesla in the app with the gist of ""hey we know you are all busy.  If it's easier for you just drop the car off ahead of time in our 24x7 lot, there's a drop box out front.  Take the envelope, write your 6 digit VIN on it and we'll get to work on your car ASAP!""

So I show up at 10pm the night before, drop the car off, pop the key in the drop box.

I show up later in the day, my car is parked in the lot where I left it, key card in the frunk.  I walk up, get in, test the camera, go into the app and confirm the repair, sign the zero dollar invoice and drive home.  Never saw or talked to anyone outside the app.

If it's a track-only car, then it's a really bad one because everything that makes a track car good is the opposite of what the Roadster aims to be.

No road car can compete with a race car. You want tons of downforce all the time, you want the car to weigh 2500 lbs or less. You want a suspension that could never be usable on the street. You want slick tires that will last longer than not.

And for drag racing, you can already buy road legal cars that can down 6s in the 1/4 mile. A Twin Turbo Huracan can put down 2000+ hp and still be used on the road legally.

TeslaMotors,problem,c0e6oz,How Owning a Tesla Changed My Life,"Many of us here talk about the features of our cars, the newest firmware update, the little problems (and sometimes big), and nuances of owning and driving a Tesla.  But I want to shift the conversation for just a moment and speak to how owning a Tesla has impacted my life as a whole.  I emphatically encourage anyone else here to share your story, good or bad, as well.  So here goes...

&#x200B;

I commute about 3 hours a day in heavy LA traffic.  Next to NYC, it's probably the most grueling nightmare of lane changes, starting and stopping, praying to the Gods of Sidestreets that you can make it home with a fraction of your sanity still intact in the US.  The HOV lanes are a small reprieve at times, but often just as congested as the regular ones.  On any given day, most of us that live here probably in jest wish for a quick death to end it all just so we don't have to sit in another hour of traffic; yet somehow we prevail to drive another day.  We drove our dumb cars, in dumb traffic, with dumb people, and even dumber gas prices.  This was our plight, and yet we were resigned to it, even though with every breathe we said ""Dear Lord, why me?  What did I do to deserve this?""  We returned home fatigued, haggard, with barely enough energy to cook a good meal for ourselves or our families.  We fell asleep during movie night with our significant others because the road took what life we had left in us at the end of a long work day.

&#x200B;

Then Tesla came around and offered me an alternative.  While not perfect by any means it was light years better than what I'd ever experienced.  I've driven all sorts of beaters in my life, but my last was not what one would consider an uncomfortable car to drive.  My old 335d dutifully got me from point A to B while trying it's best to smooth the bumps in the road, however it was still a comparably a dumb car despite it's price tag.  When that car caught fire and burned to the ground because of a recall issue, I vowed to be brave and try something different.  Out of this wanderlust came my Model 3 LR AWD; a technological marvel.  I work in tech and can discern what's good and just mediocre.  From day one hopping into the frying pan of traffic and enabling the AP, I found a freedom I never knew before.  Throughout the long stretch of the 405 in LA it did nearly all the heavy lifting.  It kept me safe by ensuring I was the proper distance behind traffic to avoid rear ending someone, which is sometimes a challenge because of a vision depth perception issue I have with my eyes.  I no longer awoke in the morning dreading the day, the drive to and from work.  I trusted that this car, quiet, efficient, safe and smart would deliver me to my job and allow me to work to my full potential.  By the end of the day I immediately noticed that I had the energy and mental acuity to better tackle my tasks as a father and husband at home.  Even though it's been only a couple months of owning a Tesla Model 3 the nights where I told my daughter I was too exhausted to play Shopkins with her, or tell my wife that I didn't have the energy to cook us a good dinner is a thing of the past.  I'm so much happier now, and so are the people around me that I love the most.  Yes, there are sometimes little glitches.  Sure, sometimes service has lagged when I needed it.  But all in all, if I had to slap down the same amount of cash down on a car I'd buy this one again in a heartbeat.  I have the deepest amount of gratitude to Tesla for what it's given back to me; my life.  I have faith that it will only continue to get better over time with Full Self Driving, OTA updates, and improved service.  But what it's given thus far is so much, and means the world.  I never expected or thought that something as simplistic as a car could have such a deep impact on my life, but when it comes to my family and my ability to have what I need at the end of the day to give them what they are worth, it means everything.

TeslaMotors,problem,naah3s,My model 3 saved my life today,"To preface this, I was on my way home for the day in basically stopped traffic on a busy highway. I was in the right lane and wanted to move into the middle lane.

Problem was there were a lot of oncoming cars and almost no breaks in between them. I saw a decent sized gap coming in the cars and decided to try and change lanes as fast as I could. So I hit the accelerator, but my car moved about 2 feet and then stopped. No warnings or beeps, just stopped. For a split second I thought that was weird. After that brief moment I saw out my left side that a car had swerved into the middle lane (the one I was merging into) at a high speed moments before I tried to merge. The car stopped me from accelerating so I wouldn‚Äôt be T-boned by a large SUV at 70 mph.

TeslaMotors,problem,6giiao,My Model X 90D Driver Side Falcon door opened on Freeway driving 65mph with my 6 y.o. sitting next to it,"Please see below our Tesla Experience... any input as to how we can share our story for child safety and expedite our refund from Tesla would be appreciated.  This is our email to the service manager of Tesla

Hi Sandra

I‚Äôm writing to you as per our telephone conversation to formally request Tesla to refund the cost of our Model X 90D vehicle due to its compliance with the California Lemon Law.  We purchased the car on January 5, 2017 and has had a slew of problems that will be detailed below.  However, the most notable problem that fall under the California Lemon Law is the driver side falcon door; which despite at least three attempts to fix opened while driving on the highway.  Thus it would fall under the part of the law that states, ‚Äú Your vehicle‚Äôs problems could cause death or serious bodily injury if it is driven, and the manufacturer or dealer has made at least two unsuccessful repair attempts.‚Äù

As a recap of our conversation, you state that you have contacted the legal team and they responded that if the car is in compliance with the California Lemon Law the refund should be a ‚Äúslam dunk.‚Äù  This process will take between 4-8 weeks and you will assist in attempting to shorten the time as you have done successfully before.  You were also adamant in helping us understand that you have had your engineers meticulously check through the car and replace the faulty parts.  The car has now passed the quality checks and we are to return the loaner and pick up our car to drive as normal until the refund is fully processed.  We were also asked to verbally approve a 100 mile test drive so that Tesla can do its due diligence for their quality check.    However, since the faulty parts that were replaced are the same that has been done before without full resolution of the problem I voiced my concerns in continuing to drive the car.  As we purchased this car specifically for our parents who have difficulty getting in and out of our higher cars, we would feel more assured if Tesla can give us a definitive assurance that the door has been fixed since we are forced to drive the car until the refund is complete.  You informed us that Tesla, as well as any automakers in the world would never give that sort of assurance that their fix would not break again.  As my six year old son was sitting next to the falcon door that opened on the highway, this is an answer that is very difficult for me to accept.  I had pleaded with you to consult with your legal team to make sure that we are really unable to keep the loaner because driving the faulty car will give us additional anxiety. Also if the door is potentially not fixed the damages may be much more serious the next time and perhaps irrecoverable. My suggestion is as much for our family‚Äôs safety as well as Tesla‚Äôs decreased liability.  You informed me that there is nothing more you can do for us.  As the car is now ready for pickup on Friday and Tesla has a 72 hour window for pick up you have given us clearance for pick up of car on monday June 12, 2017. 

Below I will go into a detailed timeline of our experience with Tesla.  I hope this will help the refund go smoothly and efficiently.

On Sept. 21, 2015 we reserved our Model X

On Jan. 11, 2016, we configured our Model X. 

On Jan. 5, 2017 we picked up the car and brought it home, there was warning sign that there was low windshield fluid and the software needed to be updated at the service center only.  Thus the car was not fully serviced upon delivery of car. 

On Jan. 7, 2017 We were heading to a children‚Äôs birthday party.  The car started to beep non stop on the freeway.  We had to pull over and call roadside assistance for help to reset the car twice before it returned to normal. 

On Jan. 9 2017, we brought back car and they updated software which took more than a few hours.  They also filled the windshield wiper fluid to full.  

When we took the car back home, after a couple of hours, we realized our garage was flooded with windshield wiper fluid.  Apparently the windshield wiper fluid container was cracked.


On Jan. 10, 2017, we brought the car back but they didn't have parts and we waited a week for it to come in.

Meanwhile while we were doing paperwork for rebate and the HOV lane stickers, we realized the VIN on all our paperwork were incorrect and we had to contact sales to get them rectified and resign all paperwork.

On Jan. 16, 2017, we brought in the car to fix the windshield wiper fluid container and resign all the paperworks.  

At this service we met Tanya, Service Adviser, who informed us if we had any issues to personally contact her and she will assist us at her utmost.  However as the problems continue to arise, Tanya no longer responded to our communications after the April falcon door incident. 

Along the way, while more frequently on the highway driving, we realized we were hearing wind sounds coming in from the right side passenger window. Also the passenger side falcon door was squeaking

On Jan 26, 2017 we brought the car back and the technician found the seal was not installed properly on the window and changed a new one.  The door was also readjusted.  

On Jan 28, 2017 while at the mall the driver side falcon door was unable to open no matter which button you press.  However the car read the door as being opened.  We immediately called roadside assistance, they advised since the car seems safe to drive we should drive to our service center as it was a Saturday and they were still open.  See service report to see work done.  We picked up the car on Jan 30, 2017. 

After this service, we were upset at how many times we'd visited this service center since pickup and they offered Tesla merchandise as compensation but we said no. We would at least want the first year service free.  They agreed. 

In March, the passenger side window with which they fixed the seal became increasingly squeaky when opening and closing the window. Thus we had to bring it in to service on Mar. 27, 2017 to fix. 

On April 23, 2017 at the Water Grill Restaurant in Costa Mesa, the driver side falcon door was unable to open again despite pressing all different buttons.  We left message at service center as they were closed on a Sunday and called roadside assistance to reinforce to the service center that we will need service on our car ASAP due to the car beeping that the door is open when it is not.  Roadside assistance reassured us the car should be safe to drive due to it being ok the first time this happened.  However, once we got home after 45 minutes the car was still on because the falcon door is read as open.  Roadside assistance request to manually turn off car and leave door open overnight as any motion in the car would turn it back on again. Roadside assistance was also confused as why the car did not turn off itself after 45 minutes as it should with no movement.  

On April 24, 2017 we brought in the car for the fix and on April 25, 2017 we were called to pick up the car as ready.  However on April 25 upon pickup the technician was demonstrating that the door was fixed but after one attempt the door became stuck again and had to be immediately put back to be serviced.  Despite the fact there is only one service ticket for this fix, it should technically be counted as two as they were delivering the car to us the door broke and we had to make an extra trip on April 26, 2017 to pick up the car they reassured us was fixed.  

On June 2, 2017 we were at Toy R Us in costa mesa with our parents and our 6 year old son, a total of 5 people.  For context, my son sits next to the driver side falcon door, me in the center and my mom on the right. My husband and father are in the front.  As we were leaving, the left side falcon door was stuck again.  We immediately called the service center due to it being Friday but since it was late in the day we left a message as they were already closed. We started to drive home because through our previous experience we were always advised to drive the car back to the service center as the car is still drivable.  During the ride, I was calling the roadside assistance to write up a ticket to reinforce to the service center to call us to schedule service first thing in the morning. While on the phone with roadside assistance, I head a click in the door and the motor as the door started to lift open.  I grabbed onto the door with my left hand and held on and the door had about a 2-3 inch gap.  We had been on the road for approximately 15 minutes at this time and were on the 5 north freeway right before the Tustin Ranch Exit.  We immediately exited and parked in the Tustin auto center.  The door opened once we parked and clicked closed once the button was pressed. As we were close to home and can drive home via local streets, we drove home.  We informed roadside assistance to immediately set up a tow first thing in the morning on Saturday as my son‚Äôs birthday party was on that day.  In our eyes, the car was not safe to drive and we were all severely traumatized by that event.  Had the door opened the damages would have been irrecoverable and my son‚Äôs life was put in imminent danger, a feeling no parent should ever have to feel.  

As it is, we are still forced to drive this car by Tesla due to our parents physical limitations.  Per Roger the head technician during our phone call on Jun 6, 2017 he is confident that he had pinpointed the problem of the door and he was very apologetic in not doing a more comprehensive check the few times before we came in for this problem. He is confident that the problem is fixed however Sandra you are unable to do the same before we pick up the car again. Again, the conflicting messages worry me for the sake of my family‚Äôs safety. 

We had high hopes for Tesla as indicated by how long we wait for our car. We are severely disappointed by the quality of the our Tesla and the customer service that we are receiving.  Please review our case as soon as possible as we do not feel safe in this car.  Please send me a confirmation that you have sent in our formal request to the legal team and they are actively processing our case. 

Thank you

TL/DR model x falcon door faulty, attempt to fix 3 times, opened during driving on highway, put my child in danger, tesla wants us to continue to drive car, won't guarantee its fixed until they might/might not refund car based on lemon law

Help: I did not lock this post for comments, how do i unlock it.  The post has been unblocked by the community moderators on 6/12, thank you to those assist me in doing this. 

We have just connected with Jon McNeil and he seems eager to assist us to resolve this issue.  We will have to wait and see for the final results.

I hope he helps us resolve this issue quickly.  I see that there are many who think we've sensationalized our story but unfortunately it is all true. It is really disheartening. Perhaps ""pooled"" may have been a better word than ""flooded"" but it doesn't take away from the fact that they delivered a over 6 figures car with a defect that should have been caught during their strict quality checks.  However the main point is still the falcon door opened while we were driving on the freeway.  We're grateful to be safe.  We are hoping that they will let us keep loaner until the refund process is complete and that is all.  That being said, we can't control everyone's opinions and we're not trying to, just sharing our experience so other who are considering the car can make more informed decision, especially parents.

TeslaMotors,problem,in35cd,Model 3 charging problem (video included),"Here is a [video](https://streamable.com/9jfi6t) of the oscillation. I can‚Äôt get it to go to 32 amps. It will get to 16 and then drop to zero in a loop. It‚Äôs not the power being supplied, as this is happening from both the NEMA 14-50 and the 48amp wall charger in the garage. This occurs only in the Model 3, and the Model X charges at 48amps consistently without problems. They are all on the same circuit breaker, only one charges at a time. I say all that to eliminate the issue of the car reading the supply loads.  This has never happened before and the car has always charged at 32amps without issues. Any ideas?  Thanks!!

Edit, others have acutely pointed out that there is noticeable voltage lag. Ok. But after letting the car sleep a bit, it went back to normal, still sagging considerably. https://streamable.com/mbiks9

Edit 2: Tesla Service wrote this: ‚ÄúHello u/Delirium101 this is Tesla service [...]. For the Model 3 not charging, it seems is a know issue and the potential fix will come via software version 2020.40.

In the meantime, please reduce the amperage to 16 amps and it should charge. Once you received the firmware update 2020.40 and it still doesn't charge please let me know by creating another appointment and I'll follow up with our diagnostic support team.‚Äù

TeslaMotors,problem,j595ns,So Tesla‚Äôs quality control is really bad. Our brand new model y‚Äôs entire roof just fell off,"My dad bought a brand new model Y today, and he brought me along to pick it up just in case he needed help with any tech problems. Everything was going fine and we were driving back home when we started to hear a ton of wind. I thought maybe a window was open but a minute later the entire glass roof just blew off.  After a brief panic we turned around and drove the new Tesla convertible back to the dealership.

When we got back we called highway patrol to tell them that there was a car roof somewhere on the 580, but somebody might have gotten into an accident, I‚Äôm not sure. The manager at the dealership said that either the seal for the roof was faulty, or the factory just ... forgot to seal the roof on? I can‚Äôt imagine how something as big as the roof not being attached could make it past quality control. Has this ever happened before?

Edit: The manager offered to get the car serviced for free, but we declined and are probably going to get an entirely new car. Whether we're still getting a Tesla is up to my dad but probably not.

TeslaMotors,problem,rpvjtr,V11 interface theory...it's for first-time Tesla owners more than anything.,"The v11 interface has plenty of stuff for long-time Tesla drivers like the blind spot camera and light show and so on, but it's the interface changes that are bothering us.

Perhaps the biggest complaint is that things that used to be right there on the bottom bar are now hidden in a menu (sometimes two layers deep).

After using it for a bit, I have a theory about why things are the way they are. With the ""apps"" being draggable, that sort of makes sense...they're preparing for a future where there are more apps. Perhaps an app store, or maybe just more apps and services. 

But with the controls, I think this release is acknowledging that the ""new Tesla owner"" experience can be a little confusing and the company clearly plans for there to be a LOT of new customers over the next year or two. They're at a 1M/yr run rate now and have two plants coming online in the next 3-4 months.

When someone buys their first Tesla, as I did a year ago, it's a little confusing how some things are on the bottom bar, some things are in the main car screen menu, and some things are in submenus. It's not clear which controls you can work from the steering wheel and which only work on the screen. 

This release, for all its faults, does two things well. One, it puts pretty much all the critical driving stuff on ONE screen. You tap the car icon, and all the things you need while driving are right there. There's more on that screen, it's a better use of space, it's clearer for first-time Tesla owners. Odds are if you want to know ""how do I [common car thing you do while driving]"" it's on that screen when you tap the car icon.

If you ever use the screen to do something you can do with the steering wheel, a little tutorial popup appears to tell you how you can use the knobs on the steering wheel (like if you skip forward on a music track or adjust the volume). I don't recall ever seeing that before.

I think they've got a little work to do, sure. Showing dual AC controls when the AC isn't split is more confusing than not and takes up valuable space. They could allow a few more icons on the toolbar, they don't need a ""recently used apps"" section, and if they let us drag most common controls down there instead of just apps it would solve nearly all problems.

But I think, from the 30,000-foot view, this update probably makes the ""first time Tesla"" experience a bit less confusing. And it seems to me, with the huge number of anticipated first-time Tesla owners over the coming year or two, that may have been a primary motive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/rpvjtr/v11_interface_theoryits_for_firsttime_tesla/,jasoncross00,73389.0,0.6708

And that's with 9 months of no Model S shipping, creating a backlog.

I think it's really neat that the Plaid goes so fast, but I would guess that they'd reach a larger consumer base if the high end model had 600 miles of range and higher quality interior materials (I know this has been improved overall, but something like a Maybach-quality trim). I'd also imagine the gaming system is adding less to orders than a bigger battery would (and it seems they've possibly decreased the kWh from the previous generation to save cost).",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/o2f785/plaid_has_a_demand_problem/,triclavian,21382.0,0.9325
TeslaMotors,problem,18wcumo,First External Review of FSD v12,"X post:

#FSD beta v12.1 is finally here. I received the OTA update while our family was vacationing at Universal Studios in LA. I couldn't wait to get home and upgrade to FSD. The release notes for 12.1 were surprisingly simple, stating that v12 has single-stack end-to-end neural nets trained with millions of video clips for the driving controls. This replaces the previous 300k lines of C++ imperative programming. Essentially, we now have to ""trust the nets"". So, how do I feel about FSD v12 after driving 500 miles? 

Here is a quick rundown:

Positive Surprises

The car drives more like a human. My wife couldn't tell whether it was me driving the vehicle or the car itself.

Highway situations:

FSD v11 (single-stack highway and locals) already handled highway driving quite well, but you could still sense the mechanistic nature of the C++ code in the control decisions. FSD v12 feels so natural. 

Here's one scenario that really surprised me: You're driving in the fast lane (left) of a two-lane highway because slower cars stay in the right lane. Then a faster car approaches from behind. FSD v12 signals, safely switches to the slower lane, lets the faster car pass, then switches back into the fast lane and stays there.

Speed control is much smoother and appears to adjust itself smoothly with the surrounding traffic flow.

FSD v12 is more patient and assertive during lane-changing maneuvers. There's no more ""middle-of-the-change hesitation"" (changing mind in the middle of a lane change).

City steets driving:

One of the ""hardest"" problems that FSD v11 and earlier versions failed to solve in my nearly three years of testing FSD beta is a surprisingly simple setup ‚Äì what I call ""neighborhood laneless road snaking"". It's very common in neighborhoods, where there are single-lane roads wide enough to accommodate roadside parking, or simply single lanes that gradually diverge into more lanes, or vice versa. All previous FSD versions struggled and tended to snake left and right within what the car perceived as a ""wide"" lane. Because of this single defect, I could never convince my wife to trust FSD driving. Well, that's finally gone in v12 with the end-to-end neural networks for driving controls ‚Äì it simply learns how a good human driver would handle such a situation ‚Äì just stays the course.

v12's handling of bumps is excellent! It reduces speed very smoothly to about 10 mph while going across bumps, making the ride super smooth.

Areas for Improvement

STOP signs: The car really doesn't have to wait a full 5 seconds (I know it's less than that, but it definitely feels that way) at every STOP sign. Every time, I have to push the accelerator to make it go a bit faster. Even if I had the patience, I'm sure the driver behind me wouldn't ‚Äì they'd be thinking, ""What the hell, you're driving a Tesla?!""

Perfect speed control is challenging because some speed signs are simply incorrect. You can't have a 40 MPH speed limit right in the middle of a highway, or try to accelerate to 70 MPH during a ramp onto the highway. It's definitely better in v12, but this still remains the main input I have to adjust from time to time.

Road conditions can sometimes be dangerous. There may be potholes, foreign objects that a good driver would constantly stay alert for and safely maneuver around with fine steering adjustments. I haven't tested FSD v12 enough in such situations, but I believe it will need continuous training to accommodate all these hazardous road situations and learn how to safely handle them.

As stated by Tesla, it is now mainly trained for good weather conditions (such as in California), and still needs a lot more training in areas with heavy precipitation, including rain and snow.

Conclusion

FSD v12 with single-stack neural networks for driving controls is definitely the (ONLY) right path forward. In fact, I think Tesla should have taken this approach much earlier rather than wasting time and effort tuning the C++ code for driving controls, which would have made it practically impossible to realize true FSD. 

Now with FSD v12, I see a step change that fundamentally solves those ""hard-to-solve"" issues ‚Äì just mimic humans! The rest is just more data and more training. That's it!",https://x.com/goproai/status/1741867410976891047?s=46,mjezzi,39409.0,0.9955
TeslaMotors,problem,nbo9sj,Problems with Model Y hitch installation,"I had a hitch installed by Tesla on my Model Y. The panel that covers the hitch is extremely difficult to open.

I was also sent a video describing how to modify the panel to make it easier to install and remove. The video also included a link to a third-party supplier of a tool to open the cover. I told Tesla I was not satisfied and now I'm no longer getting any response from the dealer. Is it too much to expect that they provide a tool for accessing the hitch?

Then Tesla sent the documents and it became clear why I payed almost 7'000 usd less than my friend. Btw I live in Europe.

Still, I trusted Tesla's advisors that told me the car is even better than the Fremont one, and cheaper, and you can charge to 100% semper etc etc.

The car has problems and a really big one: The lfp battery is not convincing me. My charging speed and supercharger is... bad (40-50Kw with 10% battery left, preheated, 5¬∞C, no other cars charging, V2). It takes forever to charge...   


The other problems are less relevant and some only concerning my country  
\- Tesla account for spotify not working: Solutions I found: make yourself a premium account or try hard reset. I went for the premium account as I really like spotify  
\- Headlights: where I live your daytime running light need to be turned on all the time. On ""auto"" they automatically turn off when I drive in sunny situationts  
\- TPMS: it took time but now I know which one I have (the old ones). Still, if you need, be sure to check which one you have before buying some (i.e. check the manual)  
\- Updates: sometimes they are just great.... sometimes not. I started losing 10% overnight after the last update (**2020.48.26),** the one that farts even more. Then I found out it was due to activated scheduled departure. Solution: just inform yourself before updating and always charge your car before an update.  
\- the MIC is heavier. I don't know if I'm the only one, but driving a lot on mountains, I feel like driving a heavy car. So glad brakes are working well...  
\-  Autopilot speed limit recognition: where I live it works bad recognizing only about 80% of limit signs. I hope this will improve with updates as speed tickets are expensive where I live...

So, I helped my wife to make a video about our  [Problems](https://youtu.be/b8nBF8wQmL4). What do you think? I really appreciate the car, I smile everytime I have to drive somewhere... and cry when I have to supercharge.

[Android app store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appuccino.bestla)

My goal here is for Bestla to be a companion to the main Tesla app, providing as much functionality as possible that the main app doesn't support. And, as the title says, I'm always going to keep it much more affordable (the main two Tesla apps that have a somewhat similar feature set are $45 or $10/**yr** \- this is $10/one-time or $1/mon), and *I will continue to work on it to keep adding more features, with 5 updates shipped this month already*.

I made the app free to try for 7 days, and any support it gets will let me work on Bestla more often by taking more time off from my job (software engineer at a search engine you may have heard of).

**Some key features:**

* View vehicle data over time, such as battery degradation, odometer, and temperatures
* Many ways to use actions (ex. lock the doors, open trunk) without opening an app
   * \[Android\] Google Assistant support, such as ‚ÄúHey Google, open the trunk‚Äù, with custom phrases
   * \[iOS\] Siri support, such as ""Siri, open the trunk"", with custom phrases,
   * \[iOS\] Shortcuts support w/ home screen widgets and automation (""lock the doors when I leave the house"")
   * App Shortcuts: long press on the home screen icon to perform actions, or press and hold to drag actions to their own home screen icons
   * \[Android\] Quick Settings tiles, for quick access next to other tiles such as WiFi and Bluetooth
   * \[Android\] Persistent notification with customizable actions
* Schedule actions (ex. warm the car at 8am on weekdays, or lock the doors in 5 minutes)
* Homelink support
* More in the full list on the app store

**App privacy**: The app does **not** store any login information.

TeslaMotors,problem,dds0nj,Continual problems with Tesla home charger. Don't know what to do,"Wondering if someone much smarter than me can provide me with a little help as to what is going on with either my car or my charger. I will try to be brief.

I purchased a used 2015 P85D in October of 2017 with 12,000 miles on it.

In October 2017 I also get a Tesla home charger installed at my house. I live in a somewhat small town and only two electricians in my town are trained/approved by Tesla to install them.

Fast forward to October of 2018. I have had minor issues with the car but nothing beyond what I would call minor annoyances.

So one day in October of 2018 I plug in my car. I come out later and notice the green light is not on so I go to the circuit breaker panel and see it is tripped. Thinking it might be fluctuation/spike in power I think it is a fluke. So I reset the breaker only to hear lots of popping and see smoke. I then manually trip the breaker and call the electrician.

Electrician comes out and 90 amp breaker is fried. He replaces it for free thinking it might be a bad breaker.

So for the next year, everything is fine. Nothing but minor problems.

Then a few days ago (October of 2019) I come out and the charger is blank. I walk over to the circuit breaker panel and the breaker is not tripped. So, I reset it and the car starts charging again. It looks good so I go back in the house.

I then come out an hour or two later and the garage is REALLY hot and there is a bizarre smoky smell. I go over to the panel and manually trip it. I call the electrician and they come out the next morning. Same thing; circuit breaker is fried.

I call Tesla and they recommend a 100 amp breaker. Electricians look confused. They state, ""we install these all the time and we have never used a 100 amp breaker."" And if I understand them correctly they don't think a 100 amp breaker will work or fit.

Tesla then recommends lowering the AMPs selected on my car from 72 amps to 60 amps. That is the best compromise we can come up with.

So, I do that and charge the car. Come home late last night and Tesla is around 15% battery left. I plug up and come in the house only to come out the next morning and battery is at 35%. It is telling me to check power source and the Tesla charger is blank. As a test, I manually reset the breaker and I hear the popping sound.

I quickly trip it again and call THE electrician who cannot come out until Tuesday.

Any idea what might be going on here? At this point, I am guessing that it is my car or the charger itself? Anyone had anything similar and what I can do?

The closest service center is 150 miles away and as luck may have it I have an appointment there next week. I might bring my charger as well to see if they can find something wrong.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/dds0nj/continual_problems_with_tesla_home_charger_dont/,TurkishDrillpress,13745.0,0.9511
TeslaMotors,problem,caljv3,Drove a Tesla model 3 for the first time yesterday. Holy balls.,"I scheduled a test drive about two weeks ago and drove 2 hours yesterday to finally experience the car I‚Äôve read so much about. I gotta say, holy shit! Better than I could have ever imagined! Handling was perfect(didn‚Äôt get to try out sport steering option which I regret), acceleration was crazy, it was like I was constantly in the 6k rev range of an ICE car but without the annoying engine sounds that accompany that. The ride was comfortable, lots of room in the back and the glass roof just makes the car feel so much bigger. Also made sure to look at the panel gaps that people complain about and I guess this one just didn‚Äôt have that problem as I saw no difference between the model 3 and the Audi parked next to it. Though they did have some older model s that did seem to have some weird gaps. I could say so much more about this car but I‚Äôll just say that it exceeded all of my expectations. 

On a side note, I brought my parents with me and my dad also got to drive it. He would not shut up about it on the way home. ‚ÄúThis car is the future‚Äù and ‚Äúif I‚Äôm gonna buy a new car, it‚Äôs gonna be from the guy who builds rockets‚Äù. They were also super surprised that the guy who drove with us didn‚Äôt try to sell the car afterwards. I tried telling them that Tesla doesn‚Äôt have dealerships but they were convinced that there would be some sales tactic involved. 10/10 experience.

Edit: another side note, we also decided to install a 240v receptacle outside of the house we airbnb and offer something like a 25$ discount to people who drive their EVs to the house.

TeslaMotors,problem,gysero,4 things my BMW 5 series did better than my M3P...,"So I've officially completed just over a month with my M3P and I'm in love. As a daily commuter, it's just brilliant. Simple, comfortable, and very satisfying to drive.

With that said, there are a few things that seem glaringly inferior when compared to my previous experience with BMW. Full disclosure: I'm a car fanatic, and pledge loyalty to no brand. I love cars for what they are and rotate through new cars every 12-16 months or so because I love to try new things. There's no hate to Tesla here, just some observations on what I think could be easily improved via software.

**1. Deactivating the car alarm is an utter FAIL.**

So using your mobile phone (iPhone 11 Pro here) as the car's key is brilliant. While it isn't perfect and can take a moment to connect via Bluetooth when approaching the car sometimes, it's mostly pretty flawless. I really enjoy the experience. It's something I love, *except* when the alarm unintentionally goes off.

One really poor example is when I went into a restaurant to grab take-out while my wife and 2 young daughters stayed in the car. I set HVAC to stay on and brought my phone in with me for mobile payments. As I was returning to my car my wife opened the passenger door to grab the food from me. But because my phone hadn't connected via Bluetooth yet, her opening the door triggered the alarm by opening the door from within.

This immediately triggered the alarm. 

If you haven't experienced the alarm, here's a quick synopsis of what its like. It's ALARMING ;)

Now imagine what it's like being inside the car still.

Heavy metal Bach music is blaring at 5000% volume, and there is NO obvious way to minimize the volume (due to lack of volume knob like a traditional car). I mean I get that it makes sense to add it because its the alarm, but seriously, it was dangerously loud for an adult, let alone a very young child inside the car.

Of course, anyone standing in front of their car is going to feel befuddled as they grope around their pockets for their key to disable the alarm only to remember that your phone is your key. Now you have to grab your phone, unlock it, open the Tesla app, and then ""unlock"" your car, all while your occupants are having their eardrums melted by the ""modern"" theft-deterrent system blasting heavy metal at 5000% volume. A ""traditional"" car could be deactivated by jamming a button on your key fob while the keys are still in your pocket. As a first-time Tesla phone-key alarm deactivator, there was simply NO warning or preparation for this kind of experience. Totally not cool. 

This seems like a glaring oversight. Not only was it an embarrassing experience for me and my family, but also any bystander who doesn't appreciate Teslas would be watching as music is blasting and thinking ""why the heck would I want my car to do that?"" Worse though, what if there was an infant in their car seat while my wife was also in the car? That could cause literal physical damage to a very young baby and there is NO apparent way to turn off any alarm quickly.

Serious fail. C'mon Elon.

* There has to be a better way to deactivate the alarm, or, proactively determine what sets off an alarm. For the latter, why can't it use the seat sensors to sense whether someone is in the car? Or the internal camera? Or use the HVAC setting to leave it ""On"" when I leave the car (or combination of both) to predict that someone may still be in the car. Or best yet, once the phone has connected via Bluetooth, deactivate the alarm. Or a push notification on my phone pops up to deactivate quickly. Finally, a deactivation method to type in a 4-digit pin on the screen would have been VERY helpful in this situation. But without any warning, the pin may not have been super obvious.

While I love the Model 3s minimalism and simplicity, there doesn't seem to be enough oversight on this functionality and how one would want disarm false alarms. It made me embarrassed to own a Tesla to say the least, and the 5 people watching us nearby were probably assuming that Tesla drivers love blasting annoying music and pissing everyone off around them.

**2. Remind the driver that they left their phone in the wireless charging tray.**

It's only been a month, but I've left my phone in the charging tray at least a dozen times now after leaving the car. Since I use the phone as my key, this is kind of a problem. My (18+) BMW M5 would notify me on the dash, and with an audible signal, that a phone is in the charging tray whenever I put it into park and opened the driver's door.

Considering that the UI notifies me when I'm closing the center console too hard (and it not sticking), I think this is a simple request.

* PLEASE, can you just set up a UI reminder that I have a phone to grab, especially because it is THE KEY? You could even make it a toggle in case people don't like it.

**3. Tesla is known for its automated (or semi-automated) driving capabilities, but my BMW was superior in two simple ways.**

When activated on the freeway, my BMW seemed far more ""simple"" in its semi-automated driving. 

First, the steering wheel resistance amount required on my M3P to not trigger a ""warning, hands on the wheel"" seems far too little on the M3P. I'll have my hands on the wheel and it won't detect them. While that is kind of annoying, it gets worse when you apply some resistance and accidentally kick it out of autopilot.

Second, the more frustrating part, is that once you ""kick it out of autopilot"", you have to manually reactivate it. My BMW would automatically turn back on once you put your hands on the wheel, and, even after changing lanes. It would stay on completely until you turned it off. 

When I change lanes in the M3P, it deactivates autopilot and then you have to turn it back on. It gets old after about 3 times of doing this and then you just don't want to use the feature anymore because of how annoying it is.

* Allow Autopilot to turn back on after a lane change. I don't want to have to think about Autopilot again when I feel the need to take over the car temporarily. 

Thirdly, the reactivity of the active cruise control to decelerate when approaching a car in front seems far more excessive than the BMW did. It will decelerate in a much more extreme way and is quite jarring in some instances. This would require a more refined sensitivity level, but, just my opinion on this last one.

**4. Allow users to adjust the lower UI controls.**

I think the UI in the M3 is far superior than the MS I drove in 2018. The always-on controls on the bottom of the screen are helpful, but I would LOVE the ability to customize them.

Two things I will likely never use in AZ: the front or rear defroster, and the seat heaters. That takes up valuable UI space for something I would rather have: 1) rear HVAC on/off, 2) Fan speed (non auto mode), 3) other.

For #1, since I live in AZ, the AC will be used basically ever day for 9 months. I would love a quick toggle to turn the rear AC on and off. Sometimes I have the kiddos with me, sometimes I don't. Right now I leave it always on so I don't have to mess with it, but obviously that uses more energy than needed. This would be quite welcome.

For #2, when in auto mode, the fan speeds adjust based on the thermostat setting. But if you don't want it in auto, then you have to enter the additional HVAC menu and make adjustments there. I'd love to manually control fan speed from the lower permanent UI than having to go into a menu.

For #3, I love seeing the energy consumption graph. Not a deal breaker that it takes 2 taps to get there, but I'll never use the heated seats or front/rear defroster icons. I don't need those taking up 20% of icon space, especially when I accidentally turn on the heated seat when reaching for the HVAC temp control.

* Suggestion: allow users to edit the lower UI icons. Take a play from Apple (or any other smartphone) and allow your main buttons to be customizable. The Macbook's Touch Bar is completely customizable and has a very intuitive interface to do so.

TeslaMotors,problem,jti9sg,Unable to supercharge my car. What options to I have before I sue Tesla?,"# UPDATE:

It looks like it's fixed. My car is no longer telling me I need a payment method and it's no longer tell me I'm blocked from supercharging. I haven't gone to a supercharger yet, but I'm hopeful. After this thread started getting traction and my tweets got some re-tweets. u/TrepidatiousBuffalo reached out to me as well as 3 reps from Tesla AND I finally heard back from Erik via email. Somebody did something (I think u/TrepidatiousBuffalo) did something because all the sudden I was able to make a payment online with a button that wasn't there before and the errors were gone. So after nearly 3 weeks, I THINK this is finally fixed.

To u/TrepidatiousBuffalo, Wyatt, Andry, Arshkit, or Erik (was beginning to wonder if you were real). Thanks for helping.

To all the people who responded with constructive ideas or simply just to share my pain and frustrations. Thanks, I appreciate it.

To all the people who thought it was hilarious that I would consider suing because I'm not entitled to supercharging or whatever dumb reason. Fuck you people. Just because you're so brainwashed that you'll eat shit while saying thank you doesn't mean I should too. Legal or not, have a case or not, this is simply not how you treat customers. Period.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Looking for some thoughts from the community here.

Starting on Oct 27, 2020, after a stop at a supercharger, my M3P said I am blocked from supercharging because there is no credit card on my account, however, I do have a credit card on my account. I called customer service to figure out what is going on and they found out my supercharging is connected to someone else‚Äôs account and that this issue will have to be escalated to another team to fix.

For the time being, if I want to supercharge, I must call customer service, tell them the situation, then they unlock **ONE** supercharging session for me.

So far it‚Äôs been:

* 19 days since this started
* 8 calls to customer service (on 2 of these calls they swore it was fixed, it wasn‚Äôt)
* No timeline to get this fixed
* A guy named Eric is in charge of my problem, at least 4 times CSRs have told me that Eric will call me back soon. I still have never heard from Eric.

I had a road trip planned for this weekend, but it looks like I won‚Äôt be able to go because I only get 1 charging session at a time and customer service is closed on the weekends. So, I can‚Äôt take my $72,000 car more than 150 miles from home.

On top of this, I noticed that my supercharging history since this ordeal started is not showing up on my account at all, so it stands to reason that this other person can see exactly where and when I‚Äôm supercharging. I asked a CSR point blank if this other person can see my charging details and the CSR was unable to confirm that the other person can‚Äôt see my details. So, this could be a privacy and data breach issue as well.

I‚Äôm not a litigious guy, but I‚Äôm not seeing another option here. Does anyone have any suggestions before I engage a lawyer?

EDIT:  I know it's a long shot, but I've been tweeting u/Tesla and u/Elonmusk about this and have had no response either.

My autopilot on my new vehicle is just OFF. I‚Äôve been on AP, taking a curve, and it‚Äôs jerked outside of its lane unprovoked a handful of times. I had to override to not get in an accident. It‚Äôs happened randomly so hard to repeat at Service center. 

It also takes curves in what I can only describe in increments. Jerks in a direction, centers steering and then jerks again. 

I took it in to the service center, they said a camera was ‚Äúnot responding‚Äù and replaced it. Ok fine. Still having problems. 

Took it again and they suggested a alignment. Ok fine. Still having problems. 

Tried to make a 3rd appointment and they‚Äôve canceled it twice stating they can remotely tap into the system and don‚Äôt see any problems!? My car never even made it into the the SC. 

The third time I tried to get into another SC. They want to charge $200 for a diagnosis and if they don‚Äôt find a problem they won‚Äôt reimburse. If there is, they will warranty repair. I don‚Äôt see any incentive for them to admit it‚Äôs under warranty at this point and just see myself out of $200. 

Any suggestions on what to do at this point? I‚Äôm lost. I don‚Äôt enjoy driving the car anymore and it‚Äôs sad because I used to recommend the car to everyone. 

Thanks everyone.

TeslaMotors,problem,fznz74,"No Homelink, No Problem (MYQ - Chamberlin)","... It‚Äôs a bit lengthy but may be worth it to some. 


First and foremost, hope everyone is doing well with the pandemic we are experiencing. 

Now, just like the title says let‚Äôs get to it! 

After reading the following tweet - https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1247411179569287169?s=21 - I had to debate if I wanted to get a homelink added to my MY or wait for this update and figure a workaround for my garage door. 

While updates / feature request along with everything else may take some time , I think I may have found a viable solution that works specifically for MyQ equipped garage doors and below are the steps I took to get to the solution: 

1. Create an account with IFTTT. Popular integration service for smart home devices / applications. 

2. Create account for MyQ equipped garage doors. This is needed so IFTTT can recognize the device at residence.(more on this later. 

3. Login to the IFTTT account and search for MyQ.

4. There should be a button that mentions ‚ÄòMyQ works better with location‚Äô. Once found click it. 

5. This new page/menu should show a few different services but we want to find the one titled ‚ÄòClose your MyQ garage when you leave home‚Äô. This service should mention something about an active account linking subscription. Select connect. 

Now normally, Chamberlin - producers of MyQ - would charge for any account looking to use an integration service such as IFTTT. However, to my surprise Chamberlin is doing a free account link. This will allow uses to connect to the service. 

6. After selecting connect for the IFTTT service, it should give you a login screen for that of MyQ. Use the same account information you would use to login to MyQ. Now your MyQ account and IFTTT should be connected. However, it should have triggered an email from Chamberlin (MyQ) for the free integration account. Follow the direction in the email and come back to IFTTT when you finish. 

7. Once back in IFTTT, you should be able to type in your address in order to geofence your desired radius from your house before having this service fire. The only other selection would the door/house tied to the MyQ account. 

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
IFTTT mobile app should be used as this will keep track of your location. 
Ensure notifications and locations services of said device is turned on and always available for IFTTT and not while only in use. 
2FA (two factor authentication) is highly recommend as the location of your garage is now linked to one of your services. 
THIS WILL ONLY CLOSE the garage door at the moment. Hopefully there will be another service to open the garage if entering another geofence. 

TL;DR: follow the instructions to use IFTTT to work around having to put homelink in the car for now. 

I just got off work , tired , and on mobile so excuse the typos etc. I‚Äôll be happy to update if anything was missed as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/fznz74/no_homelink_no_problem_myq_chamberlin/,FDon1,3224.0,0.9968

TeslaMotors,problem,favmmu,"Found large screw in car after service appointment, turns out it was an important one.","So this happened this morning. I had a service appointment to fix the heating in the back seat, and to replace the steering column module with the stalks (for the second time).

When I got back in the car, I found two screwdriver bits in my central console, and a large screw. I went back inside and handed them over at the service desk. I joked and told the guy: ""these tools aren't mine, and I hope the screw wasn't an important one."" He laughed and said: ""No, I know what that is, thanks for returning it, and I'll tell the guys in the workshop not to forget stuff in the car after they finish.""

Five minutes later, as I'm driving to the office, I get a phone call. I was already in a call, but luckily it was nothing important, so I hung up and took the incoming call. It was the Tesla service desk: ""Sir, please pull over immediately. Tell us where you are and we will come to your location right now.""

So apparently the screw I found was the one that keeps the steering wheel in place.

The guys apologized profusely, fixed it immediately and in the end, no harm was done. But still, I'm happy I didn't accidentally pull the steering wheel towards me while driving, or I would have had a real problem.

TeslaMotors,problem,dfqrkt,The looming legal problem of self-driving Teslas,"Forgive me if this has been discussed, and please point me to it.

I'm sure this has crossed most of your minds at some point already

&#x200B;

**TL;DR Has there been any talk about how companies with self-driving tech will be held responsible for tragic accidents caused by software/hardware failure on insufficiency?**

&#x200B;

**Example:**

**Scenario 1:** I'm driving a ""regular"" car. I'm texting. I don't see a pedestrian and I hit them and kill them. My auto insurance covers me with 100k/300k liability. Most likely, My insurance company will pay out \~300k in damages. I'm an asshole for texting and driving. The end.

**Scenario 2**: I'm riding in my future FSD Model 3, which is self driving. For whatever reason, it fails to recognize a pedestrian and it hits and kills them. Now TESLA is on the hook for damages in the millions.

&#x200B;

Based on the amazing article posted earlier today, It was estimated that 94% of auto accidents were due to human error. No self-driving car will ever be perfect, but as Elon said, making the roads 10 times safer is completely reasonable.

&#x200B;

In this not-so-hypothetical future situation, TESLA is being penalized for providing something that has made the roads 10 times safer. **What is the legal plan to prevent that from happening, and allowing our roads to become safer as fast as possible?**

&#x200B;

Other thoughts

* we've seen what wonderful things big car companies' lobbying power can do to keep TESLA service centers out of some states. Since TESLA is at the bleeding edge of FSD, you can bet big car companies are going to do whatever it takes to get the legal system to drag their feet on this.
* You are 80 times more likely to die in a motor vehicle accident than in an airplane accident. Yet, the general public is must more fearful of stepping on an airplane than in their car. Even when FSD level 5 is here and it is 10 times safer than human driving, General perception will still be fearful of giving up control because of what ""could"" happen
* If auto companies (or FSD companies) are going to be held liable for damages due to FSD - related accidents, is this a win or a loss for auto insurance companies, and what will their lobbying strategy be?

Joey from teslabout here. My friend and I have been hard at work over the past 6 months creating [https://teslabout.com](https://teslabout.com). After months in closed beta, we are excited to announce the start of open beta today.

Teslabout is a modern web application for viewing live and historical metrics for your tesla(s). We enjoyed using other services such as teslafi and teslascope and they inspired us to build atop that idea to create a mobile first design. Below are some key features.

**Visually designed for all screens**

We‚Äôre a bit obsessed with our Teslas and metrics so we wanted a way to always be able to view them. Whether that means we‚Äôre at our desks in front of giant monitors or if we‚Äôre just in a restaurant making sure the car is locked, we made sure teslabout looks stunning on all screens.

One of the goals we had for making a mobile first application was to mostly replace the official Tesla app. We hated waking the car by simply opening the app or having to wait 30 seconds with the app open before we could turn on climate control. We have a command palette embedded in the dashboard that you can just press and go, no need to wait for the car to wake up first.

**Metrics**

We love metrics. We love them so much we couldn‚Äôt fit everything we wanted to trend on one screen. To solve this, we decided to create a fully custom trend tool that gives the user full control. You want to trend kwh consumption vs temperature? You got it. You want to trend odometer against battery max range against drive efficiency? No problem. You can even pick your own time range to trend against.

**Data importing**

Like many of you, we‚Äôve used a number of different services and wanted a way to aggregate all of our data so we could see it anytime. You can import data right from your settings dashboard.

**Trips, charges, and locations**

Driving and charging your Tesla is a huge part of its day. We track all of these with aggregated metrics for each trip and charge including efficiency, cost, and savings (vs ICE).

**International friendly**

Whether you like metrics, imperial, or something in between we‚Äôve got you covered with granular unit of measure preferences. We even have support for 15 different currencies.

**Security**

This one is a given. Nobody wants their stuff hacked. We took multitudes of steps here. You never have to give us your Tesla email and password. The tokens are all we need. If you decide to use your Tesla email and password, we never store them All sensitive data (tokens, passwords, etc.) are encrypted or (salted +) hashed before storage. All data is encrypted while in flight. 2 factor authentication. Secured user sessions to prevent session hijacking

**PWA friendly**

We don‚Äôt quite have the resources as 2 devs with full time jobs to create fully native applications but we did ensure that teslabout is PWA friendly and performs as if it were native.

It‚Äôs free to signup over at [https://teslabout.com/landing](https://teslabout.com/landing) and for those interested, we have a FAQ page here: [https://teslabout.com/faq](https://teslabout.com/faq).

We also have a paid tier ($5/mo/vehicle) for those interested in historical data or just want to support us. I took the day off from work so that I could stick around to answer any questions so ask away!

Update 1: We pushed a more relaxed password requirement.

Update 2: Made minor fixes to account registration and uom preferences. More uom fixes on the way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ewo5kz/announcing_teslabout_open_beta/,teslabout,1170.0,0.9949
TeslaMotors,problem,87sj6c,Problems with repair at Service King,"In early January I was in an accident with my Model X. I was following at what I thought was a safe distance, but apparently that wasn't enough for when the driver in front of me realized that he missed his turn and came to a complete stop in a road. I avoided him off to the right but lost control and hit a curb further up. Its pretty depressing that my first accident is in the first car I've truly cherished. It's a seriously fantastic vehicle.

I called the King of Prussia service center and asked where they recommended I take the car to for repair. They told me that Service King in West Goshen PA would be the best bet.

I knew going in that getting the car repaired could take a while due to the availability of parts. I let the first month go by without bothering Service King. Then I placed a call just to get an update. The first call I was told that the person handling our case wasn't there. I had to ask for a callback. They never called. A few days later I called back and received a laughing ""the parts aren't in but you know how Tesla is, they come when they come!"". He told us that they can't track the parts.

I let another two weeks go and placed another call. Again, nobody is there with answers and I would get a call back. I again received no call. A few days later, I call back, I get the same response from the person handling our case, ""you know Tesla!"".

So my wife called our delivery specialist and we found out that, yes they could track the parts, no they didn't order them correctly. The delivery specialist told us he would try to help move things along and call Service King to address the issues. With the delivery specialist telling us he was intervening, we called Service King a day later for a true update. The Service King rep was screaming at us on the phone, blaming Tesla. It's one of those things that I wish I had recorded. I guess he was angry that we reached out to Tesla? It was hilariously unprofessional, I still can't believe the reaction of this man.

I think we are pretty level headed people, we just wanted an update. We called a total of 5 times in 3 months and 2 of them were just to get a call back. I'm trying to see the humor in all of this but at this point I just want my car back. I have zero confidence that this repair is going to be done 100%. Short of having my car removed from Service King and taking to another shop, I think my best course of action is to ask the Tesla service center to look it over once complete.

TLDR: We've been trying to be patient but it was made abundantly clear that Service King isn't handling our Tesla repair properly. The employees have been really unprofessional with no call backs and screaming. I recommend you 1) don't crash, 2) if you do, find another repair facility.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/87sj6c/problems_with_repair_at_service_king/,roarkandberry,30392.0,0.9763
TeslaMotors,problem,ehbyrd,Is there an official place to report problem areas for autopilot?,"There are a few spots on the highway where I live (540 in the Triangle) where AP consistently and suddenly slows down, changing its set speed of 80mph to anywhere from 70mph to 50. It's the same exact spots every time, regardless of traffic or weather, so my question is, is there a place to report this? It's one thing to hold the wheel while AP is driving, but it's physically impossible to act quickly enough to avoid it slamming on the brakes in the middle of the highway, which makes it downright dangerous to use.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ehbyrd/is_there_an_official_place_to_report_problem/,thiskillstheredditor,60184.0,-0.7876
TeslaMotors,problem,ptiy84,"Just got a Model 3, never drove an electric car before","I ordered a Model 3 Long Range on 8/10 with red paint and a white interior. I picked it up on the 9/18. My previous car,  which I traded in, was a 2017 Mazda 3 2.5. I got into Tesla after watching so many reviews on Youtube. I also wanted a faster car since I can be immature and need to satisfy that side of me.

I live in an apartment and the garage doesn't offer charges however a  somewhat near Walmart has a WaWa with 150kwh chargers so I can shop real quick and get charged up. I also installed an outdoor 6-50R at my sister's house though the GFCI breaker is tripped every few hours (something I'll have to play with)

Accessories: I got a cheap Frunk mat on Amazon, I ordered a trunk and interior mat set from Taptes, and a month before I got the car I ordered a spoiler similar to what the 3 performance has. It was only $120 and fake carbon fibre (glossy plastic) but it went on great and looks fine. 

Problems: I was super worried about problems with the car because of all the internet chatter. The only thing I noticed were swirling marks on the trunk lid paint in one spot, like it was cleaned too much. 

 The gaps on the trunk panels and trunk lid bigger than my old car but it's consistent which I'm fine with. I also realized I never examined any new car I purchased in such detail before. I think all the news about Tesla is causing such a critical eye that problems present on all new cars to some extent are being pointed out.

Things I love:

\- Red paint - It's not maroon or bright red, it doesn't have that ""pull me sports car"" look to it. The $2000 extra cost is annoying , especially since the white multi-coat is free, but I'm happy with my decision.

\- White interior  - I can see how annoying it is to keep clean but I don't care, it's so high end looking

\- Performance - I purchased the $2000 acceleration boost when I picked it up. I was even thinking of the  ingenext module that turns it into a performance but I think this is enough. So many people have complained about the lack of exhaust note but the feeling of movement is everything to me. You push the pedal and it just explodes off the line. It's not shocking after 70mph but honestly that's probably a good thing, I don't go to drag strips or race tracks.

\- General driving - The steering is great, the car goes where you want, it feels planted to the road, as if it's on a track (rails). 

\- The stock 18inch tires look really good (with the $60 caps). I know the Aero hubcaps get you 10\~miles of range but I'm not a fan of them. I do consider this a positive because they give you the option, if they were being cheap they could have used basic steel rims under the hubcaps

\- The options available for customizing the car not just the infotainment system. You can change so much and I think Tesla is forcing other car manufactures to start upping their game.

Some stuff that's annoying:

1. On the infotainment system sometimes text is slightly greyed out but it doesn't mean ""off"", ""not selected"", or ""unavailable"".  I'm much more used to how software uses grey as an indicator of state. For example on the graphic of the car it says ""trunk"" in a light gray and below that it says ""OPEN"" in a somewhat darker gray. It makes me think ""Is the trunk disabled or is the function to open it disabled?"".
2. You can't adjust UI window sizes or minimize some parts of the UI. If you aren't self driving I'm not sure how useful the car's detection view is (the left side that shows what the car sees). I would love to full screen the map, full screen the audio, etc.
3. The navigation isn't as good as Google Maps. 
   1. You can't set a default zoom level or a preset levels based on distance of next navigation and It doesn't zoom far enough in when you are going slow or when a turn is coming up. This is annoying in cities.
   2. I can't find out how to see alternative routes. Sometimes there are easier highway routes that might take a few more minutes but are an easier drive. Google maps shows you those routes and the time for them, it even performs time updates as traffic changes.
   3. On a drive from Long Island NY to New Jersey it suggested a route through Manhattan (NYC) that has a $6.50\~ toll and heavy city traffic driving instead of an alternative where you only are in the city for a few miles on one street. The times were either the same or a few minutes more.  *For those that are curious Route 1 was LIE -> (TOLL) Midtown Tunnel -> city streets -> Holland Tunnel. Route 2 was LIE -> 278 -> Manhattan or Williamsburg bridge-> Holland Tunnel.*
4. On the app icons represent either actions, state, or description and it's not consistent. There are three types, Trunk is text and says ""open"" and ""close""  (Action). The charging port is an icon of a lightning bolt, grayed out means closed, bright means open . The door lock is a symbol that represents state, a closed lock means it's closed, open lock means it's open
5. If you are near the car (connected with bluetooth) it shouldn't warn you when you want to open the frunk. I get that if you are away from the car you should get a warning but I should be able to disable while connected with bluetooth.
6. I wish the windshield wipers were on the wheel stalk but I'm not as upset now because I didn't realize you can hit the button a little to have it operate once.
7. I'm having so much trouble getting used to the turn single stalk. The amount of force required to get past the marker for making a full turn is weird to me but I'm sure I'll get used to it.

Overall I'm so happy with my purchase, maybe I'll get a license plate that reads ""S00TLIFE""

TeslaMotors,problem,b4r6rr,Can we all agree that AP needs a ‚Äúbumper to bumper traffic‚Äù mode,"One of the greatest things about AP (and where it is the safest and most effective) is the ability to engage during bumper to bumper traffic.  I‚Äôm talking stop and go 5 mph or less.  The problem is, the following distance does not adjust for super low speed and as a result, autopilot leaves a wide gap behind the car in front of you. The gap is enough to piss off the drivers behind you and as a result you end up having to disengage or push the accelerator to tighten the distance.  The solution is simple, at very low speeds, autopilot should adjust the spacing calculus when in bumper to bumper traffic.  

Edit: many people here are asking when this is actually a problem.  I‚Äôll try to followup with a video sometime but I‚Äôm talking about extremely slow, like mostly stopped traffic where cars are creeeeping forward.  This is when others get pissed if the car in front of you has creeped and you aren‚Äôt budging (they assume you aren‚Äôt paying attention).  Above I mentioned sub 5mph, imagine like 1mph, like when you are on an on-ramp to a crazy busy highway.

TeslaMotors,problem,9s5rvt,The real problem with Tesla competition.,"Hi guys, Tesla fan here, I was wondering about on how the tax credit works in the US. To my knowledge it's a tax incentive tighted to volume on EV sales to a maximum of 200.000 car per manufacturer. Since Tesla has exousted its limit next year the incentive is going to be halved, and so on until no more of it left.
In this case when other manufacturers are going to compete against Tesla in 2019 or 2020 they will benefit full tax credit giving them a competitive advantage over Tesla of 7.500 dollar on the first 200.000 cars. This actually translates to a serious problem if Tesla does not have this incentive anymore.

It really should be much easier to buy a car than what I'm experiencing right now. I live in Michigan which has ass backwards laws regarding manufacturers selling directly to consumers (thank you dealership lobby...). Because of this I had to get my car from Cleveland Ohio. While the delivery process was fine, and the car didn't have any show-stopper issues (1 tyre dustcap that they replaced right then and there), the process of getting the title transferred from an Ohio title to Michigan title is for lack of a better word, asinine.

Tesla requires my lender (Chase bank) to produce a title request letter to send to Ohio BMV so that they can produce a paper title to then send to me so that I can sit at the secretary of state for hours to get a license plate. I'm getting the runaround I feel by Chase telling me that Tesla needs to do something before they can produce that request and then Tesla says Chase needs to sent that request before they can do anything. What are my options here? I've had the car for 45 days now and had to get another temporary plate just so I can drive it legally. Have other Michiganders/people who live in states that Tesla isn't allowed to sell in dealt with this kind of nonsense?

The problem is known and Elon even acknowledges it by saying it should be better now. But what if the damage has already been done and the memory is nearing the end of its life? It seems that it takes awhile before the memory fails. Chances of it failing during warranty seems pretty low. Is it fair to charge someone for a problem that is already known?

TeslaMotors,problem,rm4ncn,Dangerous FSD Beta bug - Please be aware,"**tl;dr If FSD enters an intersection on a yellow light and the light turns red while in the intersection - and the cameras can still see the light - FSD will hard brake in the middle of the intersection.**


I nearly got rear ended a couple days ago, and I've since reproduced the condition enough to understand what is going on and IMHO this is very dangerous so people should be aware of it if you aren't already.

If you have already entered an intersection and then the light turns red, FSD will SLAM on the brakes and try to stop right in the middle of the intersection. Obviously the correct behaviour here is to either continue through the intersection or not enter in the first place. I'm not sure what logic is used to determine if it continues on the yellow or not, but once you are in the intersection you sure as heck should not be stopping.

The first time this happened I thought it was more phantom braking. The second time I got more curious and then the third I happened to notice in the corner of my eye the traffic lights turning red on the FSD display. After that I intentionally recreated the situation a few times, enough to determine this behaviour was consistent.

It may manifest more in areas like mine that have some really huge intersections. Also from this I learned that the car can see a lot more than I can lol. Each time this happened I couldn't even see the lights anymore as they were too far above me, but the wide FOV cam apparently could!

Note this is on 10.5 as I am one of the ones seemingly stuck on that. I don't know if the bug exists on 10.6/10.6.1/10.7

I have sent this same information to Tesla directly for what that's worth.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,qqlf3q,Tesla Vision in stop and go traffic is noticeably rougher than when radar was enabled. Is quite frustrating on typical highway drives. (FSD Beta install disabled all radar),"I'm a 2018 Model 3 RWD owner and have been using FSD beta build for about a month now.

As many of you probably know, once you install an FSD build on your vehicle, the radar gets completely disabled, even when the FSD Beta features are not in use.  ""Tesla Vision"" is in use at all times, just like on more recently purchased Model 3's and Model Y's.

Here's my concern (which I'm looking for feedback about to determine if others have had the same experience):

Prior to updating to ""Tesla Vision"", radar based AP on highways was fantastic, even in stop and go traffic where the flow would changed from 0-30mph over and over.   Truly a joy to use - even my wife looked forward to using this feature on road trips, whether driving or a passenger.  Rarely was there any extreme acceleration or deceleration, nor was there delay in realizing the car in front was moving or quickly slowing down.

Since installing the FSD beta build software and having the radar disabled  (using Tesla vision), using AP on highways is functional, but a fairly stressful experience.  It's no longer a joy to use and my passengers simply cannot stand it in stop and go traffic.   In such traffic, it almost always begins breaking too late and accelerates too aggressively when the lead car has given no indication it will be speeding up any significant amount (leading to another hard breaking event).  It's this a common experience?  Are literally all 3's and Y's being produced now experiencing this same performance quality?     I have to say, it was pretty jarring & surprising to have something that was so polished take such a significant step backward, with no word from Tesla to clearly set that expectation. 

To clarify, I don't see a safety issue here (except maybe an increased chance of being rear-ended due to sudden stops at lower speeds). The feature is simply far less natural/comfortable to use... Enough that we've considered opting out of the beta to get radar enabled AP back until there's word of noticeable improvement.

Edit:

Perhaps Tesla Vision does not truly disable radar altogether, but rather greatly deprioritizes the input data received on cars that have it (while also able to function on cars that have no radar)  This would make sense as they fine-tune the vision only methods and I identify areas where they are superior.   Unfortunately, as an end user it's easiest to identify areas where the vision methods are not superior.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/qqlf3q/tesla_vision_in_stop_and_go_traffic_is_noticeably/,skifri,10133.0,0.9456
TeslaMotors,frustrating,nzu1zh,I feel like Tesla's communication around the Model S Plaid has been extremely dishonest.,"I feel like Tesla's communication around the Model S plaid has been extremely dishonest and I want to give some examples.

**0-60times LR vs Plaid**

 On tesla.com the 0-60 times are given as 3.1s for the LR and 1.99s for Plaid. *However* when you look at the fine print (and that only shows when clicking on feature details) you see that Tesla has ""With first foot of rollout subtracted"" but *only* for the Plaid making this an apples to oranges comparison.

If you were to also subtract rollout from the LR times the two numbers would actually be much closer, so Tesla is intentionally making the performance gap seem bigger than it is.

**The screen tilt**

Tesla advertises on the Model S pages that the center screen tilts but now it has come to light that this is something that is not available right now and supposedly comes in a software update. You cannot actually move the screen even manually. There was no mention anywhere that this feature will come later. 

And by knowing Tesla's timelines this might as well be 2 years away.

**""The car shifts by itself""**

Elon has tweeted a lot about how the car shifts itself and many news outlets reported on how you don't have to shift manually anymore. Now we know the car can only shift out of park by itself and this is also a **beta** feature, which is arguably one of Tesla's tricks to not have to claim liability.

You still have to shift gears to do 3 way turns or to park, using the onscreen shifter.

**The gaming capabilities**

The product page of the Model S shows the Witcher 3 and the event they demoed Cyberpunk. None of these games are in the car and there is no communication if or when they will be available.

The Product page also shows a game loaded on the rear screen. It is not possible to start games on the rear screen as of now.

**The Plaid+ cancelation**

""Plaid+ was canceled because Plaid is too good"", ""No one needs more than 400 miles"".

Both of these statements are quite dubious and it is clear that Tesla is hiding *something* here, maybe not enough orders or maybe problems with manufacturing the new cells.

I am a Tesla owner and generally very happy and still think that Tesla is the best EV manufacturer but I must say that I become increasingly frustrated with the stuff coming out of Elon's mouth because at this point I just have to stop believing everything he says.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/nzu1zh/i_feel_like_teslas_communication_around_the_model/,xdert,124256.0,-0.6701

TeslaMotors,frustrating,m5lg56,Very frustrated on Road Trpis,"I've posted about this before, but venting a little because I just took my daughter on a road trip from CT to upstate NY, and the experience was pretty poor. I have had my M3 now since Oct 2018, and on most days I really enjoy it. I charge at home and this works out fine.

But I have taken a few road trips, and generally speaking, the experience is poor.

Factors that make a Tesla road trip a bad idea:

1. Cold weather
2. Hills
3. Speed, or time being a factor
4. Superchargers are fewer and further between, and have no amenities

My trip to upstate NY checked all of these boxes. For starters, temps were in the 25-45 range, with winds. This automatically crushes your range. So you are starting out there. Second, if you want to make good time (i.e. drive 70-75 mph, this also has a large impact on your range). The result here was that I was only able to drive about 2 hours between charging stops. So you drive 2 hours, then stop for 20-30 mins to charge, repeat. This turned a 12 hour round trip into more like 16 hour trip.

In upstate NY, the chargers are more spaced out, understandably. But this means it actually starts to become more nerve wracking to plan your trip. You can easily miscalculate and end up out of energy, in a very remote area. I shudder to think how long it may take a Tesla ranger to find you midway between say Binghamton and Rochester. So several times I looked at a route and saw that it was going to leave me with say 5-10% battery if I reached for the second charger, but in these cases with the weather, it was too mush risk. So we would have to stop earlier.

Another thing is what is near your superchargers. In upstate NY, the choices are varied.

Binghamton and Roscoe NY - There is nothing around these except for diners, and not the good kind you'd want to eat at. Since you are stuck for at least 20 mins or more, sometimes you do anyway. I am trying to figure out how some of these places came to be. I mean, the one in Binghamton is next to some odd places, like 

Rochester NY - This one was nice, next to a mall with plenty of coffee shops and such.

In the future, I am likely to rent a car for any road trips, as the Tesla is just not designed for it. Perhaps if you are cruising at 55 with no need to arrive anywhere, in California in the warm sun, it's just fine. The car works great for me on normal days, commuting, going to the grocery store, bringing kids to practice. But if I am leaving the state, the charging takes forever. My kids even despise going for these trips because all we do is sit and charge.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/m5lg56/very_frustrated_on_road_trpis/,OldBackstop,1015.0,-0.4756
TeslaMotors,frustrating,y6hiot,"One week of FSD Beta, a very dangerous mistake, and much frustration.","So I received FSD beta finally and was quite excited to try it out.  I have yet to use it further than 4 miles away from my home but so far I'm weary.  I expected some issues and it has surely delivered. I can mostly understand the times it has made mistakes or can't make up it's mind, no problem and that's why it's beta.  Some things I've learned:

1. I cannot use it on 2 lane country highways with no shoulders and narrow lanes. It hugs over against the yellow line and in curves this is dangerous. Even on straight sections it nearly caused mirrors to collide a few times. Hugging that yellow line is the opposite of what is safe on those roads.
2. When it pulls you into a parking lot the speed from the highway is still the speed it wants to go. I can deal with this one but still an opportunity for development.
3. Turning away from the direction your turning just prior to the turn, even when starting from a stop. This was strange, when making a right turn at a stop sign with a curved curb it steers left after stopping and nudges forward, then hard steers right to navigate the turn.  I wound up blocking cars that were turning left onto my street from the other street.
4. It actually did indeed make the worst possible decision at the worst possible time and I nearly got hit.  In the picture I've put a cartoon car and drawn the line where the vehicle was to turn left (unprotected left turn). I knew this might be an issue but boy I wasn't expecting THIS.  It pulled up to the stop sign and waited. I could see that there was traffic coming from both ways and if I were driving I wouldn't have made a full stop and proceeded to pull out with the shrinking window of time I had.  When the car came to a full stop I guessed (incorrectly) that it was waiting on those cars and being cautious.  WRONG.  The first car coming from my left slowed and was turning into the parking lot. Where the jeep sits there was no vehicle.  I knew that it was likely one or more of the cars behind the turning one would go around it and proceed forward.  FSD pulled out and started to turn left.  Sure enough, one of those cars had went to go around the slowing turning one and they had to slam on their brakes to keep from hitting me.  By now I'm hitting my brakes and the vehicles from the right have made it to me and I'm stuck in the middle of the road, no turn lane to tuck into.  Horns from both sides, rightfully so.  About the time I went to hit the brakes it made a loud triple beep and cut off FSD about the time I went to apply the brake.

So...  as of right now I can use it for portions of my driving but I will never, ever, trust it to attempt an unprotected left turn. My assumption that it was going to sit there and wait for a clear and safe opportunity was very wrong.  Funny thing is, had it chosen to go out the other side of the parking lot it would have been at a red light and saved the murder left turn and another left turn from even needing to be made.

I continue to be optimistic, I just didn't expect it to be this terrible.  It's not really like riding with a new driver, more like riding with the family dog at the wheel.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,o9mtcp,Frustration over broken chargers,"So it‚Äôs great that Tesla tells you X amount of chargers is out of service. But guess what it doesn‚Äôt say? Which ones!

Pulls up, takes one (which happens to work) and I‚Äôm still stuck guessing. Surely there has to be a way for them to label them and say (3,18) aren‚Äôt working. Etc.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,dykfb1,M3 suddenly died while driving. Terrible 1st experience with roadside assistance.,"So yesterday I had just started driving away from my house, not even a half mile away, when suddenly I heard a bang/pop sound and my car slowed to a stop, saying ‚Äòlost power‚Äô ‚Äòcan not drive‚Äô etc. Roadside assistance texted shortly after to let me know I needed to be towed and someone would be there within 90 minutes. This was already bad, as I was on a busy street and couldn‚Äôt move the car at all. After about an hour I checked in again via text and they said the 1st tow company cancelled the request and didn‚Äôt tell them so they would send someone else which would be another hour! By the time that truck arrived, I had been sitting there for 2+ hours and the car had totally run out of 12V and the flashers had stopped working and it was dark. Just as rush hour was heating up. Kind of a stressful situation.

Then things went from bad to worse, as the tow driver didn‚Äôt know how to jump the car, and I couldn‚Äôt get through to roadside assistance OR the service center. We ended up having to get it on the flatbed without engaging towing mode. Windows were stuck down, etc.

Long story short, I was sitting in the side of the road for over 4 hours, unable to get help from anyone at Tesla. I finally had to Uber myself to the service center ahead of the car as it was almost closing time and I needed to try to get a loaner. Thankfully I did, and I then sat there for another hour until the truck showed up.

All told it took about 6 hours to get towed to the service center 7 miles away. Horrible communication, horrible experience.

I just hope whatever is wrong with my car won‚Äôt be as complicated to fix. I‚Äôm so grateful this didn‚Äôt happen with my kids in the car or on an expressway.

My last attempts at communication with the roadside assistance text number: https://imgur.com/a/M248JZL

EDIT: As I wrote in one of the comments below: one of the many, many problems here was that **even after jumping the little terminals behind the tow hook cover, the frunk never opened itself**.

EDIT 2: I just wrote this post to chronicle my experience and vent a little. I honestly did not think anyone would read it or care. But since it's gotten a lot of visibility, a few thoughts/takeaways from the discussion:

- This situation was ultimately the result of many failures piled on top of each other. A total cluster if you will.

- I did read the manual when I first got the car and I knew about towing mode. I also knew that towing mode would only stay engaged for a short time. The problem was that I had no idea when the truck was going to show up! By the time it did, the 12V was dead. We tried to jump the terminals by the tow hook, but then the frunk did not open. If a truck had gotten on the scene within a few hours, this whole situation probably would have been MUCH less complicated.

- It's true that 3rd party tow companies are not Tesla, but ultimately this is TESLA's Roadside Assistance program, and it is Tesla's responsibility to train and contract competent providers. After their 1st contractor cancelled without notice, the driver that eventually showed up had no idea about jumping the car, and then spent almost 2 hours figuring out how to strap the wheels down.

- If a vehicle is covered under 'Roadside Assistance', the channels of communication at Tesla need to be much more open and responsive in a scenario where a vehicle is stranded. I can't tell you how frustrating it was to get zero response at the service center or text support as the tow driver was cluelessly fumbling about. I tried calling every number I could find. The mothership knew the vehicle was FUBAR'd and had been for hours. In that scenario, Roadside should call or at least provide a phone number you can call and reach someone.

EDIT 3: **Got an update from the Service Center. Apparently an internal failure within the rear drive unit caused the pyro fuse to blow. A new drive unit has been ordered and should be arriving soon.**

Also, some more details for those asking:

- This is a LR RWD, built in Oct '18. ~7,800 miles
- The car had an 80% charge at the time.
- Software version was 36.2.1
- Weather at the time was about 40F. No precipitation.

EDIT 4: Got the car back today (12/3/19), just over two weeks since the incident. Most of that time was waiting on the new drive unit (980 Rev F). DU and pyro fuse were replaced, coolant purged and firmware updated. Took about 2 days once the parts were in. Very happy to be back in my 3.

Chevrolet's Bolt EV and Bolt EUV are both below the price threshold, but in 2019 the automaker sold its 200,000th plug-in vehicle, at which point the tax credit began to phase out.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,jor4pj,Tesla frustrations (Range/FSD/Cost/Leasing/Trust/Fear of Missing Out),"Sorry for the wall of text.

A brief background: I consider myself to be an ""average"" consumer, with an interest in tech/electric cars.

I started dabbling into electric cars with a Chevy Volt back in 2016.  This was a way for me to get ""50 miles of range"" with a gas backup.  This was great commuter car, though I questioned the quality of the gasoline backup engine. After leasing for 3 years, I had something like 70% of my driving was all electric.

I waffled back and forth about going ""all electric"" and finally pulled the trigger on a leased Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus.  I didn't know if I was going to be happy being 100% electric, as I no longer had the gasoline backup, which is why I wanted to lease.  They just came out with the $399 deal too, but I settled for a lesser upfront down-payment and sitting around $475/mo.

Overall, it's been a good experience, but there are some frustrations I have with the car/tesla in general.  I am on the fence about whether my next car will be a Tesla or not. More about this later.

Frustration #1: Average Car efficiency vs stated range:

The 2019 Standard range plus is rated for 240 miles.  A HUGE justification for me going all electric with Tesla is the supercharger network.  I also opted for the standard range variant because 240 miles in any given direction there was a supercharger.  From the Tesla Supercharger in Little Rock to the Supercharger in Memphis is 163 miles. 240 should be plenty.  The temperature for this particular drive was 50F average.  I went from 98% SOC to 14% SOC.

[https://imgur.com/a/JOAWvSk](https://imgur.com/a/JOAWvSk)  (min distance per drive 1mile)

There's nothing new here that people don't already know, but given any drive, you're only looking on average about 75-80% efficiency.  Winter city driving can be as low as 60% (and it doesn't get below freezing here.)  The reason this is important, is that you're supposed to keep the car between 90% and 10%.  The 240 range, is now 192 (10% off the top and bottom).  Add to that a wintertime efficiency of 60%, that's 115mi of range before needing a recharge. My daily commute is 20mi (10mi each way) x 5 days a week.  When I first got the car, I was charging 100% off the public infrastructure, and to be honest it was a hassle.  I had to charge on Sunday for my work week (40 mins), and Charge on Friday (40 mins) for the weekend.  The 240V chargepoint chargers work ""ok"" at a rate of about 10% SoC per hour.  If someone else plugs into the same charger while charging it's about 5% per hour.  All that being said, it was such a hassle that I ended up renting out a garage for $100/mo just so I can do daily charging. \[I live in an apartment.\]

Frustration #2:  ""Planned Superchargers""

Even though that Memphis trip was a bit of a stretch, when I bought the car it said there was a planned opening half way between Little Rock and Memphis in Forrest City.  ""Target opening 2019"" at the time.  Same with the one opening in Arkadelphia.  ""Oh well this range anxiety thing will be a non-issue once those open up later this year.""  Except they never opened.  They changed the target date to ""opening in 2020.""  I fully suspect come 2021 that will be the new target.  I know they will eventually come, but a huge let down of me expecting them to come at the advertised time.  I recently drove from Dallas to Little Rock and started out with a 95% charge, and then it got COLD outside (like 50-55F).  My defroster/heater came on and we were going to run out of battery before we got to Little Rock.  I told my wife that we have to drive without heat to make it back, and use the defroster sparingly.  We made it back with 9%. Since winter weather is just starting here, I will likely have to take my wife's ICE car next time we go.

Frustration #3:  Autopilot (included)

Before I purchased my M3, I saw videos of people \[wrecklessly\] putting on makeup while driving, and things like this:

[https://www.thedrive.com/news/36366/morons-leave-driver-seat-empty-let-tesla-autopilot-drive-so-they-can-keep-drinking-in-the-car](https://www.thedrive.com/news/36366/morons-leave-driver-seat-empty-let-tesla-autopilot-drive-so-they-can-keep-drinking-in-the-car)

I knew going in that this was not normal and extremely dangerous.  I knew going in that it was a ""driver assist"" L2 system and required 100% attention at all times.  I tapered my expectations WAY back, and decided I would be happy if it helped with interstate driving \[it does.\] Even after I purchased, people would ask me if ""is that the car that drives itself?"" I assumed it was at least a very capable system, if people are /that/ wreckless with it, then when used properly it should be a fantastic driver assist feature.

Except it's not (wasn't?).  When I first got the car, I would have horrific problems with phantom breaking on the interstate (usually involving overpasses and shadows.)  While I still used it on my daily commute, I eventually learned that I had to ""baby sit"" autopilot, just in case it decides to randomly brake.  It didn't make my commute less stressful, just now when someone pulls up close to my rear, I have to make sure to rest my foot on the accelerator in case it wants to brake.

After owning it for a bit and using Autopilot, I had to tell people that it most certainly doesn't even come close to being able to drive itself.  I even tell people that it can actually be dangerous, due to the phantom braking issues I've encountered.

To be fair, with the continual updates, it's gotten a lot better, but I still have to baby sit it when people drive too close.  I think it's a good system, and on long road trips it's a godsend for fatigue.   I do not trust it (nor should anyone for any L2-L4 assist system).  Word of note, even though I like it, it does not pass the wife test.  She yells at me for using it because it makes her feel unsafe.  I do not use it when we are riding together.

Frustration #4:  Full-Self-Driving package (add on:) / Can't buy-out Lease.

I'm leasing my car, so any add on packages are lost when the car is returned to Tesla.  Tesla also stated that there is no buying out the car at end of lease. The reason for this was because they were going to be rolling out the Robo-taxi service.  So I can't buy the FSD package, and then buy the car out later either.  I know supposedly they are going to come out with a subscription plan for lessees, and that's a decent stop gap.

The problem: After driving the Model 3 for a little over a year now, the price of the FSD package keeps going up.  It's something I want to buy, but didn't because I'm leasing.  I'm leasing because I didn't know if going all electric was for me.  I've got 2 years left on my lease, and I've been seriously thinking about purchasing Tesla as my next car.  Which kind of brings me to the very last frustration is that if FSD keeps going up over the next two years -- that owning a Tesla suddenly becomes ""not worth the price / hassle"".  Delaying the purchase of FSD just makes it more expensive so it's a zero-win game when trying to balance a budget.

All being said for me to get the product that I actually want, would be looking at the Model Y, Long range w/ FSD.  That's a $60,000 dollar car.  And FSD will go up in price before my lease is up.  The standard ranges aren't enough in my experience (outlined above), and I'm getting shafted on the FSD price going up because I leased due to uncertainty w/ all electric.

At the end of the day, I think the rising cost of the FSD package will end up being what drives me away from Tesla.  All the other hassles I'd be okay with living with, and even stretching my budget so I can get the Long range model, adding the cost of a rising FSD package is the straw that's making me consider to just go back to driving an ICE car.

There's an old saying ""The juice isn't worth the squeeze"" - well I think it was worth it.  The standard range plus is a good car.  But by the time my lease is over and I'm ready to buy, I'm guessing the price of the ""car I want"" will be too much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/jor4pj/tesla_frustrations_rangefsdcostleasingtrustfear/,netnem,1169.0,0.955

TeslaMotors,frustrating,9nyr3e,"If you aim to take Home Delivery, don't do it in a state with no Tesla presence. It is only frustrating.","I post here often. This isn't a hit piece.

I've been stuck in the middle of *taking Home Delivery* of my Model 3 for 13 days and counting. I don't want anyone else to have this experience, so I'd like to share my story. This is a Rhode Island story (so I'm sure Tesla knows who exactly this is by now) and I hope I'm the only one with this story to tell.

Rhode Island doesn't have a Tesla store, only a Supercharger. So when I got a phone call in the beginning of September to prepare for picking up in Dedham, Massachusetts I was super excited. We set a date and were good to go. A couple of days later this plan disappeared on my reservation page and I had to call support to find out whats up. Tesla informed me that I can't pick up in MA because MA would tax me for my car, then RI would want to tax me a second time. I was never suggested a Mt. Kisco, NY pickup as far as I recall, we went right to Home Delivery. 

This was a mistake.

There were stipulations. 
>First, ""home deliveries can take *14-20* days or more from the tentative scheduled date to receive your Tesla"". 

>On top of that, ""We recommend not driving your Tesla once you receive it until after you have received your registration packet from Tesla, which will be sent to you *up to 7 days after the delivery of your Tesla*. **We do not provide a moving permit.**""

So they don't provide temp plates and the Tesla collects dust in your garage if you have one for up to a week while they get you the paperwork to go register your own car in an ASAP-like fashion. Okay. Shitty, but okay.

So the original delivery date was around the 20th of September. That came and went because of difficulty communicating with my DS due to the massive end-of-quarter influx that Tesla did not prepare for. 

I don't blame my DS. This is a problem from the root. I kept on my DS as much as I could, coordinating what I could on my side, informing my DS that I need stuff like a Letter of Guarantee, running through two MVPAs because the first one forgot to bring the financed amount down because I'm paying tax on my own, and other such things. This took too long. **Way over two weeks.** I sent Tesla the cashiers check on the 1st of this month without any delay on my part. 90% of my e-mails I sent were sent within the hour of receiving it, none over 5 hours. In short, this is on Tesla.

Tesla receives my check on the 4th. They quickly dispatch the car while ""we are waiting for the cashiers check to clear"" which can take *6 days*. I find this policy strange as people bring cashiers checks or personal checks to their pickups and leave with a perfectly drivable car, but okay, the car is in transit while the check clears, that's fine. The car arrives on Columbus Day, exactly on the day it was scheduled in nearly-perfect condition. The 3rd party delivery service was fantastic, they did a great job. Not even a scratch.

The car sits the entire week with no word on the check clearing, no word on paperwork shipping, no word on anything substantial (my Home Delivery Specialist would get back to my typically within 24 hours). The only way I knew something happened with the check was the ""Welcome to the Tesla family!"" automated e-mail and the app turning on. Great, progress. Then silence. Nothing on the paperwork, other than ""It should be done on Friday, we will try to get you a tracking number"". I have informed delivery on all the major carriers, so I checked UPS, Fedex, and USPS on Friday afternoon. Nothing.

I found, just today, something that appeared on USPS. Tesla sent the paperwork on Friday ***DHL GROUND*** and it will be here on the ***TWENTIETH*** of this Month. *An entire month later than the original estimated delivery date*, 10 days later than their worst-case scenario. And this is the straw that broke the camels back to me. I could understand all the other holdups, but *sending my registration paperwork the cheapest way possible is an offense.* Meanwhile, I've been paying insurance and my debt to the credit union for the last twenty days, so to say I'm an uninjured party and should just be patient is off the table now.

If you want your car drivable off the lot, faster, easier, and with by far less complication, do everything you can to get a pickup at a real location. Don't ever do Home Delivery if you don't have a Tesla presence. It's a waste of your time.

Edit: Turns out the DHL is likely some other shipment from the same location. They have shipped the paperwork FedEx Overnight today. The rest is correct. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9nyr3e/if_you_aim_to_take_home_delivery_dont_do_it_in_a/,Shanesan,87042.0,0.9951
TeslaMotors,frustrating,ey45eb,Tire shop frustrations,"So I‚Äôve owned my AWD Model 3 for around about 8 months now, with nearly 14k miles on the car, I think I‚Äôm a little overdue for a tire rotation. Only issue is, while I can get it done at the service center paying over 100 dollars (was given a slight discount to a little over 90 after mentioning how expensive it was. Service center peeps are pretty great.), I‚Äôve been trying to get a local tire shop to do the work with no dice. I live in the south east where Teslas are pretty rare, so even something as simple as a tire rotation makes places like Firestone, as well as other small local shops quiver in fear. None of them will touch my car with a 10 foot pole unfortunately. Has anyone had any luck maybe convincing shops to change their policy or otherwise any other suggestions? I‚Äôll go to the service center if need be, but as it is a 30 minute drive out of my way, it would be a lot better to have this done closer and cheaper.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ey45eb/tire_shop_frustrations/,simply_lime,5865.0,0.8847
TeslaMotors,frustrating,gysero,4 things my BMW 5 series did better than my M3P...,"So I've officially completed just over a month with my M3P and I'm in love. As a daily commuter, it's just brilliant. Simple, comfortable, and very satisfying to drive.

With that said, there are a few things that seem glaringly inferior when compared to my previous experience with BMW. Full disclosure: I'm a car fanatic, and pledge loyalty to no brand. I love cars for what they are and rotate through new cars every 12-16 months or so because I love to try new things. There's no hate to Tesla here, just some observations on what I think could be easily improved via software.

**1. Deactivating the car alarm is an utter FAIL.**

So using your mobile phone (iPhone 11 Pro here) as the car's key is brilliant. While it isn't perfect and can take a moment to connect via Bluetooth when approaching the car sometimes, it's mostly pretty flawless. I really enjoy the experience. It's something I love, *except* when the alarm unintentionally goes off.

One really poor example is when I went into a restaurant to grab take-out while my wife and 2 young daughters stayed in the car. I set HVAC to stay on and brought my phone in with me for mobile payments. As I was returning to my car my wife opened the passenger door to grab the food from me. But because my phone hadn't connected via Bluetooth yet, her opening the door triggered the alarm by opening the door from within.

This immediately triggered the alarm. 

If you haven't experienced the alarm, here's a quick synopsis of what its like. It's ALARMING ;)

Now imagine what it's like being inside the car still.

Heavy metal Bach music is blaring at 5000% volume, and there is NO obvious way to minimize the volume (due to lack of volume knob like a traditional car). I mean I get that it makes sense to add it because its the alarm, but seriously, it was dangerously loud for an adult, let alone a very young child inside the car.

Of course, anyone standing in front of their car is going to feel befuddled as they grope around their pockets for their key to disable the alarm only to remember that your phone is your key. Now you have to grab your phone, unlock it, open the Tesla app, and then ""unlock"" your car, all while your occupants are having their eardrums melted by the ""modern"" theft-deterrent system blasting heavy metal at 5000% volume. A ""traditional"" car could be deactivated by jamming a button on your key fob while the keys are still in your pocket. As a first-time Tesla phone-key alarm deactivator, there was simply NO warning or preparation for this kind of experience. Totally not cool. 

This seems like a glaring oversight. Not only was it an embarrassing experience for me and my family, but also any bystander who doesn't appreciate Teslas would be watching as music is blasting and thinking ""why the heck would I want my car to do that?"" Worse though, what if there was an infant in their car seat while my wife was also in the car? That could cause literal physical damage to a very young baby and there is NO apparent way to turn off any alarm quickly.

Serious fail. C'mon Elon.

* There has to be a better way to deactivate the alarm, or, proactively determine what sets off an alarm. For the latter, why can't it use the seat sensors to sense whether someone is in the car? Or the internal camera? Or use the HVAC setting to leave it ""On"" when I leave the car (or combination of both) to predict that someone may still be in the car. Or best yet, once the phone has connected via Bluetooth, deactivate the alarm. Or a push notification on my phone pops up to deactivate quickly. Finally, a deactivation method to type in a 4-digit pin on the screen would have been VERY helpful in this situation. But without any warning, the pin may not have been super obvious.

While I love the Model 3s minimalism and simplicity, there doesn't seem to be enough oversight on this functionality and how one would want disarm false alarms. It made me embarrassed to own a Tesla to say the least, and the 5 people watching us nearby were probably assuming that Tesla drivers love blasting annoying music and pissing everyone off around them.

**2. Remind the driver that they left their phone in the wireless charging tray.**

It's only been a month, but I've left my phone in the charging tray at least a dozen times now after leaving the car. Since I use the phone as my key, this is kind of a problem. My (18+) BMW M5 would notify me on the dash, and with an audible signal, that a phone is in the charging tray whenever I put it into park and opened the driver's door.

Considering that the UI notifies me when I'm closing the center console too hard (and it not sticking), I think this is a simple request.

* PLEASE, can you just set up a UI reminder that I have a phone to grab, especially because it is THE KEY? You could even make it a toggle in case people don't like it.

**3. Tesla is known for its automated (or semi-automated) driving capabilities, but my BMW was superior in two simple ways.**

When activated on the freeway, my BMW seemed far more ""simple"" in its semi-automated driving. 

First, the steering wheel resistance amount required on my M3P to not trigger a ""warning, hands on the wheel"" seems far too little on the M3P. I'll have my hands on the wheel and it won't detect them. While that is kind of annoying, it gets worse when you apply some resistance and accidentally kick it out of autopilot.

Second, the more frustrating part, is that once you ""kick it out of autopilot"", you have to manually reactivate it. My BMW would automatically turn back on once you put your hands on the wheel, and, even after changing lanes. It would stay on completely until you turned it off. 

When I change lanes in the M3P, it deactivates autopilot and then you have to turn it back on. It gets old after about 3 times of doing this and then you just don't want to use the feature anymore because of how annoying it is.

* Allow Autopilot to turn back on after a lane change. I don't want to have to think about Autopilot again when I feel the need to take over the car temporarily. 

Thirdly, the reactivity of the active cruise control to decelerate when approaching a car in front seems far more excessive than the BMW did. It will decelerate in a much more extreme way and is quite jarring in some instances. This would require a more refined sensitivity level, but, just my opinion on this last one.

**4. Allow users to adjust the lower UI controls.**

I think the UI in the M3 is far superior than the MS I drove in 2018. The always-on controls on the bottom of the screen are helpful, but I would LOVE the ability to customize them.

Two things I will likely never use in AZ: the front or rear defroster, and the seat heaters. That takes up valuable UI space for something I would rather have: 1) rear HVAC on/off, 2) Fan speed (non auto mode), 3) other.

For #1, since I live in AZ, the AC will be used basically ever day for 9 months. I would love a quick toggle to turn the rear AC on and off. Sometimes I have the kiddos with me, sometimes I don't. Right now I leave it always on so I don't have to mess with it, but obviously that uses more energy than needed. This would be quite welcome.

For #2, when in auto mode, the fan speeds adjust based on the thermostat setting. But if you don't want it in auto, then you have to enter the additional HVAC menu and make adjustments there. I'd love to manually control fan speed from the lower permanent UI than having to go into a menu.

For #3, I love seeing the energy consumption graph. Not a deal breaker that it takes 2 taps to get there, but I'll never use the heated seats or front/rear defroster icons. I don't need those taking up 20% of icon space, especially when I accidentally turn on the heated seat when reaching for the HVAC temp control.

* Suggestion: allow users to edit the lower UI icons. Take a play from Apple (or any other smartphone) and allow your main buttons to be customizable. The Macbook's Touch Bar is completely customizable and has a very intuitive interface to do so.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,jti9sg,Unable to supercharge my car. What options to I have before I sue Tesla?,"# UPDATE:

It looks like it's fixed. My car is no longer telling me I need a payment method and it's no longer tell me I'm blocked from supercharging. I haven't gone to a supercharger yet, but I'm hopeful. After this thread started getting traction and my tweets got some re-tweets. u/TrepidatiousBuffalo reached out to me as well as 3 reps from Tesla AND I finally heard back from Erik via email. Somebody did something (I think u/TrepidatiousBuffalo) did something because all the sudden I was able to make a payment online with a button that wasn't there before and the errors were gone. So after nearly 3 weeks, I THINK this is finally fixed.

To u/TrepidatiousBuffalo, Wyatt, Andry, Arshkit, or Erik (was beginning to wonder if you were real). Thanks for helping.

To all the people who responded with constructive ideas or simply just to share my pain and frustrations. Thanks, I appreciate it.

To all the people who thought it was hilarious that I would consider suing because I'm not entitled to supercharging or whatever dumb reason. Fuck you people. Just because you're so brainwashed that you'll eat shit while saying thank you doesn't mean I should too. Legal or not, have a case or not, this is simply not how you treat customers. Period.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Looking for some thoughts from the community here.

Starting on Oct 27, 2020, after a stop at a supercharger, my M3P said I am blocked from supercharging because there is no credit card on my account, however, I do have a credit card on my account. I called customer service to figure out what is going on and they found out my supercharging is connected to someone else‚Äôs account and that this issue will have to be escalated to another team to fix.

For the time being, if I want to supercharge, I must call customer service, tell them the situation, then they unlock **ONE** supercharging session for me.

So far it‚Äôs been:

* 19 days since this started
* 8 calls to customer service (on 2 of these calls they swore it was fixed, it wasn‚Äôt)
* No timeline to get this fixed
* A guy named Eric is in charge of my problem, at least 4 times CSRs have told me that Eric will call me back soon. I still have never heard from Eric.

I had a road trip planned for this weekend, but it looks like I won‚Äôt be able to go because I only get 1 charging session at a time and customer service is closed on the weekends. So, I can‚Äôt take my $72,000 car more than 150 miles from home.

On top of this, I noticed that my supercharging history since this ordeal started is not showing up on my account at all, so it stands to reason that this other person can see exactly where and when I‚Äôm supercharging. I asked a CSR point blank if this other person can see my charging details and the CSR was unable to confirm that the other person can‚Äôt see my details. So, this could be a privacy and data breach issue as well.

I‚Äôm not a litigious guy, but I‚Äôm not seeing another option here. Does anyone have any suggestions before I engage a lawyer?

EDIT:  I know it's a long shot, but I've been tweeting u/Tesla and u/Elonmusk about this and have had no response either.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,5jf764,Frustrated with constant issues...,"I saw [the video that Marques Brownlee posted yesterday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM5z0dW60KE) and, after another weekend with no communication from the Regional Service Manager, decided to make this post in the hopes that someone can help me find someone at Tesla who can help me with my situation. I'm not going to name names or locations.

I took delivery of my Model S in mid-September right after Elon Musk's Q3 letter to employees and it has been plagued with issues that my local service center just hasn't been able to fix. When I first took delivery of the car it had the following problems: the trim above the dash wasn't fully attached, passenger-side ambient light didn't work, steering wheel was off-centered, the car would vibrate at highway speeds (steering wheel vibrations and vehicle shudder), constant rattle coming from passenger-side C-pillar area, and there were multiple paint imperfections (craters) on the roof (painted roof). My local service center has taken the car in for repair FIVE times so far for a total of 23 days and still hasn't resolved most of the issues - they've actually created more problems...

During the time Tesla has had my car in for service they've managed to crack the windshield, didn't test the replacement windshield - it leaked while I was on a road trip, broken the clips (i assume) to the interior A-pillar trim causing it to rattle, and whatever foam they put in my bumper to reduce the ""wind turbulence vibration"" causes the louvers/flaps near the fog lights to make straining sounds when opening and closing. They also haven't fixed the off-center steering wheel, highway-speed vibrations, and C-pillar rattle.

Before the last repair attempt I spoke with the Regional Service Manager and he assured me they would ""make this right"". Well, after 16 days, they didn't. I reached back out to him the day I picked it up to vent my frustration and ask for a replacement, especially since a car is deemed a lemon in my state after four repair attempts (3 + final). He said he'd reach out to his Director and VP and should get back to me within a few days and let me know what's going on - that was on December 6th. He hasn't reached back out to me, I've had to follow up with him and was told they were ""busy"" and that he'd ""let me know when when he hears something.""

At this point I'm beyond frustrated. I've tried calling Tesla corporate, but they just push it back on the local and regional service managers. I'm driving a lemon that just seems to get worse every time they touch it and the rattling noises are a constant reminder that Tesla just does not care. Sorry for the long post, I'm just hoping someone here may be able to help me find someone at Tesla who cares more than my local service centers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/5jf764/frustrated_with_constant_issues/,yruoc,1891.0,-0.0414
TeslaMotors,frustrating,8d60so,Frustrated Tesla Fan,"Watch out. Rant on its way TLDR: 9+ weeks from configuration to delivery has me very frustrated. Southern California Midnight Silver.  Fist off I want to say that I am a fan of tesla and have followed the company since 2012. I have wanted an electric car since before they were available. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt make the money required for an S/X priced car. I waited in line (getting there at 5am Southern California) to reserve my model 3. I planned on buying the standard range but when I got my invite I ran some numbers and after 2 days decided to go through with it. This is where my frustration began. I got the 3-6 week delivery estimate. At Week 3 I called Tesla and asked is that was still on track and was assured it was. I then sold my primary vehicle assuming I would take delivery in at most 3 weeks. Well no VIN for the next 3 weeks. I went to the San Diego store about this time and that is when I realized that I might be buying into a company that does not want me as a customer.  There I was looking at the 3 and was asking the rep about the lack of spare tire. That was when he explained to me that nobody changes there own tire. As a ‚Äúblue color‚Äù worker who had just changed the tire on my Subaru the month before this stuck me as a very elitist attitude. It made me realize in selling the S/X they have been catering to a different economic class than where I am. Well after a full 6 weeks I finally got my VIN. So yeah right. Well after 2 more day I get the call from my advisor saying I should be able to get my car in about a week. Great news. I am excited. Then the week goes by with no more contact. I reach out and on Friday I am told that I should be able to take delivery they following Wednesday and that I would be contacted Monday to schedule the time. Not to bad but we are getting now to week 8 when I sold my primary car at week thee based on the promise everything is on schedule. So Monday roles around no call no email. I wait till Tuesday mid day and reach out again. No response Tuesday. Wednesday morning I reach out again and receive a call saying that it will be at least another 1 1/2 weeks. Not holding my breath this time. I have had better costumer service at the mall shopping for cloths. I still believe in the car and the company, just think they need to be realistic with there time frames when they are dealing with peoples transportation that may not have the money to just find a different way to work for 3+ weeks beyond there promised delivery time.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,9i8xrt,"My experience ""volunteering"" to help with deliveries.","So yesterday I was near the Tesla store anyway running some errands.  I read the tweet about coming down to help out, but honestly felt the staff might be a little turned off with the idea of having strangers just show up so I didn't know if I should stop in to offer any.   Driving by the Tesla store and seeing just how busy it was convinced me that I should at least stop in to ask if they did. 

So I went in and sheepishly asked if there was anything I could do.  The people working the sales floor answered with a resounding YES and walked me back to talk to the delivery people.   We exchanged quick courtesies, I explained my ownership background, and they went through some basics of what they needed which was this:

The delivery people are slammed at the moment, they are tracking down cars on a overloaded lot. They are trying to get them into the detailing department to be prepped. If there are any issues with any particular car I can see how it might be overlooked as there are more cars at this store then I've ever seen, it's literally bumper to bumper out there.  Just pulling one out from the middle can take 25 minutes of car shuffling.  Once the car is in the delivery bay, there's also a lot of paperwork prepared, possibly trade in stuff sorted out etc.  The delivery people are constantly running back and forth from the delivery area to the back office to grab stuff from the printer or get answers from Tesla HQ.  It's quite chaotic, but they do have a system more or less that seems to be holding up.  They just are still getting used to the crazy volume.

So they asked me to do a pretty simple thing...  Just go talk to the customers who were waiting.  Once customers show up for their delivery (hopefully on time) there may be long periods of time (20-40 minutes) where the delivery people are waiting on answers from Fremont, while at the same time trying to coordinate getting the customers car out of the area where prepped cars are staged, while also trying to juggle the next customer who's coming in, and more.  It's a lot of work, and just leaving the customer sitting there alone in the delivery bay while all this is happening kinda stinks.  So they just asked me to go in and chat with people waiting.   Ask if they had the app on their phones yet, ask if they had any questions about the car they were about to pick up, give suggestions from owner to (soon to be) owner for tricks and tips about the cars.  Talk Tesla.

So I did.  Some people were super frustrated with the wait, I get that, but having someone to talk to made it a lot better.  Most people didn't have the app yet, so explaining how it worked took up some time.  Mentioning other apps and websites that might be useful (Plugshare App is practically mandatory for finding charge stations).   When there were issues with cars, and the delivery people were scampering back and forth trying to solve the issue, I was able to talk angry people down telling them about my own delivery experience.  My car had issues, I was not happy, but Tesla took care of ALL of it.  This was a big one.  Figuring out a way to politely say ""I know it's frustrating but have faith Tesla will make it right,  I wouldn't be here if they hadn't.""  And then explain that no, I didn't work for Tesla, I was just there volunteering to help out.  I was unhappy at the time of my pickup also, but 2 years later I'm volunteering for the company to help them deliver cars, and in two years they might be right where I'm standing also.  So trust that Tesla will take care of the issues on a due bill.   Thankfully most of the cars delivered were pretty much perfect so that didn't come up too much, but when it did, Tesla staff made a due bill and all the stuff needed was noted for later repair.  I never stepped in and pointed out flaws, that was up to the customer.  

On that note, one thing I did take away from it, is I'm super sensitive to issues with vehicles.  I kept my mouth shut if a car had a mis-aligned piece of trim or something like that.  But what blew me away really was... People don't care.  90% of people buying the cars did a quick walk around, gushed about how happy they were, and drove off with huge smiles on their faces regardless of the cars condition.  Maybe I am just a stickler for perfection, but seriously most everyone was stoked just to get their Tesla's.

So I'd chat with people, and then when the delivery staff came in with paperwork I'd slide away and let them do their thing.  I never touched any cars beyond showing new owners some stuff on their settings screens.   Anything involving autopilot I left in the hands of the staff.  God forbid something happens later down the road and they sue claiming Tesla staff never explained it to them, just some volunteer, so yea, I left that stuff to the staff. I basically knew what my job was, and did only that.  So I talked to a lot of people.


So basically, at the end of it all, it was fun.  I'd probably go down again, but if you are thinking of going, just be ready to spend lots of time sitting chatting with customers, killing time for the delivery people who are frantically running around trying to get cars to people.

/edit. I should add, all new owners still got the normal in-car orientation from the staff, I was basically filling in the gaps chatting with people when the staff wasn't around.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,17bqce9,Do Not Buy Tires From Tesla,"TLDR: Buy your tires from a tire place that has proper warranties...

Longer version:

Bought M3 in June 2020, tires lasted almost 3 years and in March of this year I was in for service and they said they could use a change. Thinking to myself, oh - great I'm already here let's just do it all, they are Tesla after all...I had them put on their one in-stock tire, a Michelin Primacy, and was happy with everything. Hell, even got the alignment done all for a cool $2100 or so.

Fast forward to last night and one of the tires popped and in the 100 or so feet it took to get safely, destroyed the rim. Thankfully no one was hurt, no further damage to the car.

But - I guess Tesla doesn't have any sort of warranty on tires. I didn't know this, I've bought tires from places like Discount and Firestone all of my life and had good experiences with flats getting repaired or what have you. 

But the tires in 6 months are now bald which is surprising since the ones that came stock with the car lasted nearly 3 years (which I think is a lot - but my driving style hasn't changed, it's probably gotten less aggressive since the new-ness of launching isn't as special now)

I did zero due diligence, and looking into it more - Tesla just doesn't cover them. The frustration of getting the car safely towed and everything was compounded with Tesla's customer service being unbelievably antagonistic to the point of not letting me talk without talking over me. I've had great experiences with them to date but this has been unbelievably frustrating.

Anyway...

I'm just throwing this out there as a warning, if you're needing new tires - go to literally anywhere but Tesla. They're the one item that you can get anywhere, and you should.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/17bqce9/do_not_buy_tires_from_tesla/,brandonchristensen,39454.0,0.1993
TeslaMotors,frustrating,9b1kdc,Model X order frustration,"I ordered a Model X on July 20th (at the time the estimated delivery was end of August). After placing the order a sales rep from the local store called me and offered to get me into an inventory vehicle. There was one that the exact match of what I had just ordered and I could pick it up at the end of the week. Awesome! I filled out the finance forms, etc and got ready to pick up my car.

Fast forward 2 days. It turns out the inventory car wasn't in California at all but was in Boston and they wanted to charge me 2k to transport it and it would take 2-3 weeks. At that point I just decided to go with a custom built car. Since my original reservation had been cancelled they put in a new one for me and filed a ticket to the back office to transfer my deposit to that reservation. They also said they put me in for ""first available"" build slot to try to keep my end of August time table‚Äã

I then left for vacation and kept monitoring my account but the reservation never showed my deposit and wasn't making any progress. Multiple emails with the sales rep and the store manager were exchanged and I was told that despite the deposit not being transferred that my car was still being built and the deposit was just taking some time.

All along I keep getting delivery updates for the inventory car (which I was no longer getting).

Fast forward to this past Sunday. My reservation disappears from my account. The store manager calls and apologizes but my car was never being built. He put the reservation back into the system and supposedly initiated the transfer. He's also going to let me pick up one of his test drive cars to drive until I get my car and is offering to use my referral code for customers that come in without one.

I'm frustrated but hopeful it will work out in the end. Let's see when I get the test drive car and when my Model X actually shows up. For a 100k car I was hoping that things would be a bit more organized on the backend.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,7o6o4t,Model 3 line now producing 50% more cars per day than the Chevy Bolt line.,"I am frustrated by the slow Model 3 ramp and seeing the goal posts pushed back quarter after quarter, but to keep things in perspective, consider that GM sold around 23,000 Bolt EVs last year. 

If Tesla is only making 100 Model 3's per day, that still 50% more than the number of Bolts GM makes per day.

If Tesla hits 2500 per week in Q1, that's 5x as many as the Bolt, and 30% more than Model S/X together.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,b1nx8b,Frustrated- Model S or 3,"I hope my post is different than others in that I believe I have studied well and know the differences between the S and 3.

I have to say upfront that what attracts me to Tesla like many of you is the tech, the mission and vision and the coolness of the products. However I am frustrated.

I have wanted a Model S for years. The style and its elegance. I like the 3 for the tech. My frustration comes with the choice I have to make between a 2017 or newer used Model S vs. a brand new 3. I have the money and circumstances in my life (medical) allows me to decide with my wife‚Äôs blessing to buy.

I was set to buy a S and knew what I wanted and I was fine until the V3 Supercharger announcement. I figured I could buy a S and FSD and since it is a 2017 I would get AP2 and it would be upgraded to HW3 and I would be good. Now with V3 supercharging it underscores how much I will be paying for an older battery pack with limited cooling and I‚Äôll be sitting there watching Model 3s zipping in and out in two years while I wait. It blows my mind that Tesla has not at least refreshed the battery pack in the S prior to the V3 announcement. I might have been tempted to buy a new one but there is no way I would now. Used of course won‚Äôt have the refreshed battery but I would be paying less as the used market would need to recognize the old battery vs the new.

Why not 3 then? Well first off my wife hates the interior and hates everything being on the touchscreen. I didn‚Äôt show her the glovebox must be opened with the touchscreen. That would drive her nuts. Further and no offense to the 3 owners but Model 3s are seriously selling well here in Denver/Boulder and while great it does diminish the uniqueness of the car. I count 3-5 a day going from home to work (15 miles each way). I could get over this but I remember living in LA where it seemed every third car was a Prius. Please don‚Äôt hate me! I still may get a 3!

I have been looking at used Model Ss for so long now that I can tell by looking at pictures whether the car has AP2 or 1. In one case I had to educate an owner who thought they had 2 but really only had AP1. He agreed after he saw my evidence and updated his ad. It is a lot of work to figure out what a used car actually has in terms of features. Many owners don‚Äôt seem to keep the sales sheet and due to that it is tough to tell what really is included with the car. I found the CPO VIN decode site which is great but doesn‚Äôt always work with every VIN.

Here is the thing I want a red model s with a glass roof, enhanced autopilot 2 enabled, leather (faux) interior, AWD, 75 as a basis.  Most everyone I find has one of these things missing. I spend a lot of time looking for the car that matches only to find one that seems all there until I find out I forgot to check something.(cloth seats? Who picks that for a performance Model 75D?)

I also think that the used prices are a bit out of whack where in some cases I can almost buy a new one for what people ask.

I don‚Äôt know - I keep getting pulled to the 3 but wish I could find the S I want.

Thanks for reading - no real question but a bit therapeutic. I hope you don‚Äôt mind !",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/b1nx8b/frustrated_model_s_or_3/,MarkManes,1008.0,0.9465
TeslaMotors,frustrating,cbb0f8,Tesla offering 5k supercharge miles for multiple frustrations. Is this common?,"Still waiting for this to get ""approved,"" but I really had to bother and beg to get the assistant manager at the dealership to do anything. 

&#x200B;

First inventory car order (showroom car; great deal) turned out to be on the other side of the country. This wasn't found out until the day before delivery pick-up. Huge fluke in the system they said. Zero compensation. Offered me a hat and a shirt.  Was later told my sales advisor was no longer with the company (not related to this incident, but not surprised because he was utterly useless and dilatory with everything. Zero communication.

&#x200B;

I am now dealing with one of the assistant managers of the dealership who found me a car in SoCal (I'm in Bay Area) that fit the specs I was looking for. Was delivered in time to get the tax credit. Car had a number of issues. Forced to return it next day (last day before the tax credit) because of it. Just wasn't worth the burden of feeling unhappy for a chance at saving money w/ the tax credit (I usually don't owe much, if it at all, fortunately). Again, I'm offered (2) model 3 hats. I told them to stop offering that because it was insulting. Can't believe they even did!

&#x200B;

Placed a new order and was told it would be rushed. Assistant manager said he would go to his management to try and see what they could do to compensate. I asked him if it would help sending an email recapping all the frustrations and timeline of everything because, frankly, this whole thing has been a really bad experience. I constantly feel like I have to pull teeth to get any answers. Always have to chase someone down to chat with them.

&#x200B;

Finally chat with him and he says he's trying to get 5k supercharger miles approved. I told him that's a very generous first thought but that I've read of others' misfortunes of much less hardship being compensated for more. I just want what's fair and I feel like I'm getting the short end of the stick here when spending so much money. Am I in the wrong?

TeslaMotors,frustrating,87tgmx,Service Center Frustration,"**EDIT2***

Went to appointment and worked with Tesla team. They gave me a brand new Model S to use in the meantime. Very cordial and sympathetic to situation.

***EDIT*****

They called me back and have gotten me in for an appointment TODAY! Very excited about that, and thankful. Will Update with further details of repair/diagnostics.

****

Not sure if this is the proper place for this but i wanted to express my frustration with the West Palm Beach FL service center.

I'm the new owner of a Model 3 and it's had issues. I get it, comes with the territory. The frustration is derived from the lack interest in my feedback as the operator of the vehicle. 

The car came from the factory with no bass in the sound system (mind you i paid for the enhanced sound system upgrade). They have repeatedly told me it was a firmware update issue and the last time I was there (Jan 31) they send me home for the 3rd time with the ole ""just do the update"" fix. It did not fix it, in fact, by the time I got home I had no audio at all! 

The most recent update has been a phone call today to tell me for the fourth time, it's a firmware update, but they can get me in 2 weeks from today (-____-) for an appointment. Unbelievable. Talk about poor customer service. At this point i'm going to Orlando to work with my brother (Spacex employee and how i got vehicle) to try and get this straightened out. 

Maybe since he builds rockets, they will take his opinion seriously.

Sincerely, 
A frustrated owner.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,9cdhgy,"50 days fully paid, still no delivery: A Texas Story","You may have seen me complaining around the sub here and there, but I wanted to lay out my full story today on day 50. Here's my timeline:

Reserved July 2017

Configured (RWD, Aero, EAP, White) **June 27, 2018**

Paid in full on **July 13th**

Delivery date scheduled for **August 4th**

Delivery delayed to **August 11th**

Delivery delayed to **August 17th**

Delivery delayed to **August 23rd**

Delivery delayed to **""August - October""**

That is, as of today my Model 3 has been 100% paid off for 50 days. I do not have my car, I do not have a delivery date, and my *second* loan payment will be paid today. The service and communication I have experienced from Tesla has been remarkably poor. 

My IDA seems utterly asleep at the wheel (no pun intended). In the space of my 4 delivery delays, I have taken days off work and pushed back vacation plans to accommodate, but was never once even contacted to let me know my car was not going to be there for delivery. All I have ever been told since my initial delivery date of August 4th is that ""your car is in Oklahoma."" Once I was told ""Your Model 3‚Äôs battery was not charged. This is the reason for the delay."" On the rare occasions my IDA does get back to me, she acts as if it's the first time she has heard of my situation. It's the most frustrating and disappointing purchase experience I've ever had. I know a number of other Austin residents who have ordered, paid for, and received their vehicle in the time of just my delays. One can't help but feel singled out.

Perhaps the most frustrating part of this process has been the inability to escalate my issue. Requests to my IDA, hour-long phone calls with Tesla support, and numerous emails have resulted in nothing. I've even sussed out the email addresses of a number of higher-ups in the Texas delivery division, but nobody ever gets back to me. 

I have no doubt that this will all be but a distant dream once I do get my car, but for now it has just been a shit-ass experience. Thank you for indulging my complaining.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,khwdzs,Purchase Nightmare,"Mods, please remove if not allowed. I'm just frustrated and sad and lonely and don't know where else to rant.  Purchasing from Tesla has been the WORST customer service experience I've ever had in my life and am thoroughly shocked this is even happening.

Last week on Sunday (the 13th of Dec), I got a call from a Tesla sales team member because I left a vm inquiring about trade-ins. She sent me a link and my info to the local gallery. The next day (Monday the 14th), the gallery support team reaches out to me and says there's a great deal on a slightly used showroom Model 3 (it had about 1800 miles on it and they were taking off $2700). That combined with my trade-in, suddenly made my dream of owning a Tesla affordable. So I put my $100 deposit down, called the bank THAT day and applied for a loan for the remaining amount. The gallery rep and the sales rep tell me it's only $500 to have the car delivered to the local gallery or I could drive the 4 hours down to Austin to pick up the car. I opt to drive down since it's really not \*too\* far. They assign me a delivery specialist who sent me a text through some automated system.  They send me the finale MVPA (motor vehicle purchase agreement) on Wednesday with a huge error. I call the delivery team  and they fix it and send it back- I ask if I could have the car delivered and the delivery team person says it's actually $750 and that it's ""too late"". No worries, I'll take that L. I send Tesla my insurance card which was a Cali insurance card (I was stationed Cali and hadn't changed it to a Texas card quite yet). I send the bank the finalized MVPA and they send me the loan documents which I sign right away. They overnight a check to Tesla the night of the 17th. I get a text from that same number from earlier saying my pickup appointment is set for Sun the 20th in Austin. I'm so stoked. I'm riding the high all of Thursday and all of Friday. I call my new commander and tell him the situation and he gives me a pass to not work on Sunday so I can go pick up my Model 3.

&#x200B;

Now comes the start of the headache. The morning (0828) of Sat the 19th (a day before pickup), I get a text from this same number saying my payment is still due and that my insurance card needs to be a Texas ID card and that they're rescheduling my appointment to the 23rd. So I spend my morning making frantic calls to the bank and USAA. The bank tells me the check was overnighted and they even emailed Tesla a copy of the shipping label and the check. They even send me an email forward of what they send the Tesla team. I immediately send this info to the gallery support team as well as my updated Texas insurance policy (it is now 0939). I respond to the text I got from Tesla and ask them to confirm BOTH documents. They respond at 1125 saying they have confirmed receiving them. I then get a call from the local delivery team in Ft Worth saying my pick up is scheduled for Dec 20 at 12 in Ft Worth and NOT Austin. I reach out to the Tesla team and get no response. No one is picking up calls no one is answering texts. I get a text at 1632 saying my payment is pending (despite confirmed payment was received AND cleared both via text and email) in Austin and not Ft Worth. I send them a text explaining how it's b been confirmed and sent already (I re-sent them the payment ordeal with screenshots of the text exchange) at 1814. By this point I go ahead and accept that I won't be getting my Model 3 on Sunday and now have to call my commander and explain the debacle and see if I can work on Sunday and take Wednesday off. He's a little irked but understands- cool. At 1841 Gallery Support team sends me an email saying I have completed all necessary steps to pick up my Tesla model 3 and that I am good to go- they even CC'd the local support team in Austin.

&#x200B;

I get an email on Sunday the 20th saying I need to payoff the remaining balance prior to delivery. wtf.jpeg. I log into my Tesla account and see this message except the balance due is $0.00. I email gallery support team and send screenshots of what I see- they respond saying not to worry about it and to disregard this.

&#x200B;

Today (Monday the 21), at 1745 I get a text from Tesla saying my insurance card is not for Texas. When they very clearly said they have received and validated my updated Texas policy on Sat the 19th. And that they were going to reschedule my pickup if my temp tags couldn't be cleared. I call my commander and explain I might have to reschedule and he says absolutely not. I call Tesla irate because they've now had all the proper documents since Sat around 1000hrs, they've confirmed everything was perfect, and decide roughly 48 hrs prior to pickup that something isn't right. Gallery rep says it's not their fault and blames the local team in Austin and that she'll send them an email to say that all the docs are in order and tells me I'm good. I'm willing to bet Tesla will send a text tomorrow saying some other document has suddenly disappeared despite them having it three days ago. I'm just incredibly frustrated and don't know what else to do. It's left a terribly taste in my mouth and am really considering just taking the L on my $100 deposit and canceling the order all together. I'll have the bank cancel the check and rescind the loan (if that's even possible?).

&#x200B;

End rant. Thank you for reading this far. TL;DR- Tesla team apparently has no communication internally and has made a supposedly ""seamless"" process a nightmare and half for my pickup.

UPDATE: I certainly did not expect to have this post gain so much traction so I really appreciate you all listening and commenting  (even some awards!). It's been about a week since I last posted so I wanted to update everyone. I did not get my car on Wednesday, however, the very next day after my post, I got a few messages on reddit and even a few calls directly to my phone (my name is in my username) saying that Tesla monitors forums pretty closely and that they'd like a chance to fix the debacle described above. The manager from the local gallery took personal responsibility for getting my car to me. He was an amazing point man and ensured I was updated and kept me in the loop- I'm not sure if he managed to have the car delivered from Austin to Ft Worth or if that was in the works already but either way, it seems he saved me a road trip. He even came to the delivery center in Ft Worth to personally apologize and left some goodies in the frunk. So as it stands, I am the proud owner of a 2020 Model 3- and you guys were right, it's like driving a spaceship. While I miss my 300hp sports car, there's something entirely different about my car basically driving itself to my mum's for the weekend and then back. I don't think I can ever go back to a gas powered car for a daily vehicle ever again! Shout out to Mat and the Tesla team for making this happen and fixing the mistakes!

TeslaMotors,frustrating,xnwstk,Tesla accessories I wish I didn‚Äôt buy,"So it seems like a common act of excitement to buy accessories during the long wait time while you're awaiting to receive your tesla. I think this is part due to youtubers pushing you towards that direction (because guess what they make money out of advertising for those sponsers!). So I'd like to list out the things I bought so that you don't make my mistake and burn all that cash. Before I go any further, I recommend not making the mistake I made and don't buy anything before you actually receive the car. Here's the list of things that I purchased, which ones I thought were worth it and which ones where not.

# Things I wish I didn't buy:

\- **[Center console cup holder cover](https://a.co/d/1hqb2fm)**: I bought the baesenor ones off the amazon. Honestly, I don't know why people buy anything to cover there. There original space (without the cover) is not that big enough as you might think. So any type of covering (of any brand) would make it difficult to put your coffee cups and stuff in there. So you end up forcing the cup into the place and there is like 70% chance that doing this actually increases the chance of spilling coffee outside that area. Which defeats the entire purpose and messes up your entire interior. Just don't buy anything and your car looks more minimal and oem and you save money too!  
(If you insist of having some protection I would only put something for the floor of that cup area).

\- **[Magsafe phone mount](https://www.jowua-life.com/en-ca/products/invisible-foldaway-car-mount-with-magsafe-charger)**: I bought the Jowua phone mount, for a rip off price. Bought it directly off the Jowua website and while they said the shipping is free they didn't mention anywhere during the checkout that there was going to be a 25% (or any) customs being added after it shipped. I would never buy anything off of their official website, beware. Aside from that, as much as I loved and used the carplay in my previous car I have never used my phone itself once in tesla. It's just unintuitive, because the Tesla UI is just awesome and has everything you need, you also save on phone data. Also I'm not sure if the magsafe charging is mfi certified and if has negative effects on your car battery draw or not. I would only buy a mount or a mount with charger if I was a uber driver. Otherwise save yourself money and space in your tesla.

\- **[Jowua Center console trays](https://abstractocean.com/products/center-console-tray-gen-2)**: I bought both. The youtubers are so gong ho on these! While the quality of them are nice, I feel like they're totally useless. They don't allow for much space as they show in the videos or pictures. I would either not buy anything and use the spacious area as tesla designed it (and just throw stuff in the the lazy way!!) or just buy the tesla OEM ones. Way better value for 1/2 or 1/3 the price. Much better use of space. The other brands (other than tesla and Jowua are just trash, don't even bother)

\- **[Jowua light bar thing](https://abstractocean.com/products/handheld-led-lightbar)**: Meh, it's cute but wouldn't buy it for the above reasons. After the first 30 minutes it becomes something you ignore. Don't worry you don't need that light as there is already great cabin lights in the cabin. And the amount of the space it occupies is not worth it in my opinion (You'd want to put your glasses there instead of that).

\- **[Jowua Game controller](https://www.jowua-life.com/en-ca/products/multi-device-wireless-controller)**: Update- Just tried the controllers, and realized the A and B buttons are revered. What the hell???? Big no! ~~I'm neutral on this. Still haven't used it one time because the only games worth my time are Sonic and Cuphead and I haven't received that update yet. The controller looks cute. But I feel like you could buy the xbox controller for half the price with much better grip (with sacricifing the cool look of jowua of course)~~.

\- **Jowua glove box usb connector**: Total rip off. Just buy it off ali express for 2 dollars. I'm 100% percent it comes out the exact factory with just different labeling, charging people 10 times more just for the branding.

\- **[Air freshners](https://a.co/d/6RFz9Fq)**: I can't spellout the name here (rhymes with tesla vehicle models names), but you probably know which ones I am reffering here (you can find them on abstract ocean). They smell amazing and very classy. But they end in like 1.5 days. So up to you.

\- **[Homelink](https://shop.tesla.com/product/model-3_y-automatic-garage-opener)**: I would probably save cash by not buying it. It's way expensive for what it is.

\- **[Tesla key fob](https://shop.tesla.com/product/model-s-key-fob)**: Don't waste money on this. The phone connection is already phenomenal, zero need for that. 

# Things I'm happy I bought them:

\- **[Tuxmat Floor mats](https://a.co/d/hv5mBlb)**: I bought the tuxmats. They are freaking awesome and worth extra penny/dollar. I don't think they even have any competition with the amount of coverage and the quality that they have. 

\- **[Spigen glass protector](https://www.spigen.com/products/tesla-model-3-y-screen-protector-ez-fit-glas-tr)**: Totally worth it. I bought the non-matte version and I think it's the one to go. It's so good you wouldn't notice it's even installed. The only gripe was I didn't find any good instructions when installing it and ended up installing it with a ton of frustration.

\- **[Tesla rugged trunk mat](https://shop.tesla.com/product/model-y-rugged-textile-rear-trunk-mat)**: I bought the OEM ones from Tesla shop (The cheaper version). It's awesome go for it. If the tux mats where a bit cheaper I would have definitely bought them because they are the only product on the market that offer protection for the lip of the trunk where you put your luggage. Or who knows, with the savings you make on the stuff on mentioned maybe you can shell out for the tux mats!

\- **[Armrest cover](https://a.co/d/2VtwK9g)**: Definitely go for it, makes night and day difference. Especially the comfy ones, and they don't cost that much (Edit, I bought the Motrobe brand).

\- **[Tesla Water Bottle](https://shop.tesla.com/product/stainless-steel-water-bottle?sku=9123515-SS-A)**: For the money I think it's worth it. Very cool and elegant design. Has exccellent ability on holding tempreture and a very nice soft touch to it. And it feels like a nice attachment to Tesla brand.

\- **[Model 3/Y Performance Pedal Set](https://shop.teslarati.com/en-ca/products/tesla-model-3-y-performance-pedal-set)**: I actually bought two sets of these. One was ""Top fit"" and the other was ""Motrobe"". Top fit was noticeably heaver and better quality. That being said both of them didn't actually seem to be real aluminum. Would be nice if someone with a performance Model 3/Y can confirm if the OEM ones are real aluminim or not. All the being said, It adds a very nice touch to the driving experience altogether. 


\- **Tesla Wall charger**: I bought it, 100% worth it. Especially with the voucher that I received from Tesla.

\- **Update 1** - Added performance pedals because I forgot 

\- **Update 2** - Wow lots of elite Homelink fans haha. I don't disagree that this is an innovative and very useful tech. My point was if you already have a garage door opener that is hidden on your sun vizor and just works, is it still justified to pay that amount of money for it?

\- **Update 3** - Added the links, even though it wasn't the general intention of this post.

\- **Update 4** - Just tried the Jowua controllers for the first time and realized the A and B and X,Y buttons placement is reveresed.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,18j50vc,TACC staying enabled when switching lanes is now only available with enhanced autopilot after the 2023.44.x update.,"I just got off a lengthy call with Tesla support.

Before I explain what I learned, I'll first explain what my experience has been so far with my 2021 Tesla Model 3 (60k miles). When I would have regular autopilot engaged  (a combination of autosteering and Traffic Aware Cruise Control (TACC)), if I was coming up on a slower car in front of me, I would put the turn signal on and then switch lanes. When I did this, autosteer would disengage but TACC would remain engaged and I would maintain my speed (relative to traffic as defined by how TACC works).

Ever since updating my Model 3 to 2023.44.1, when autopilot (both autosteering and TACC) is engaged, when I would begin switching lanes even with the turn signal on, both autosteering AND TACC would disengage. The first time it happened it was very jarring as the car suddenly and unexpectedly began decelerating (you know how Teslas do). I tried again a few minutes later and it did the same thing. That's when I realized something changed and throughout the remainder of my drive I made this mistake multiple times (habits are hard to break after all). I ended up trying to apply pressure to the gas peddle to avoid the jarring change in speed when TACC disengaged, but one of those times I applied too much pressure and autopilot was disabled for the remainder of my drive.

I tried to find a setting to change it back but was unsuccessful.

I called Tesla support today, and after a lengthy phone call with them I was informed that the ability to keep TACC engaged when manually switching lanes (even with the turn signal on) has been moved from regular autopilot to either enhanced autopilot or FSD.

I'm incredibly frustrated with this. Not only is this a feature on literally every other car in the world that uses some form of ACC, but it was something I understood was available when I purchased the car. To move it behind a paywall is unethical and really bad for customers. I'm sure there's some fine print somewhere that allows Tesla to do this, but...

I'm also frustrated that they made this change without warning. It's dangerous and scary to suddenly start decelerating without warning. A car traveling too close behind me could hit me, and it puts me and my passengers at risk. For Tesla to make this change without warning is not just a bad experience for customers but adds risk to drivers.

I wanted to open this post up for discussion to see how many other users are experiencing this change. Perhaps Tesla customer service was wrong. I'm hoping we can all learn something about whatever changed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/18j50vc/tacc_staying_enabled_when_switching_lanes_is_now/,buckf1tches,14761.0,-0.8568
TeslaMotors,frustrating,99k6u6,Got stranded after Tesla removed my car from the Tesla App.,"I ran out to get some food in my Model 3 today. Didn't need my wallet since I had samsung pay. Came out of the restaurant and couldn't open my car. Checked the app do see if the key was connected and it just gave me an alert that my car with Vin # 5YJ3E1EA5JF0086\*\* had been removed from my account.

I checked the website and it was still listed in my account so I calmed down a bit but then realized I was still stranded. I called Tesla Support but they were closed so I called Road Side Assistance and was told to call back after 8AM when app support could assist me. I told them I was stranded and they suggested I have someone come pick me up. I told them I could have my wife come get me, but the kids were already sleeping. They said cheerily, ""well that should work then. Have a good night,"" and hung up.

I'm ok with couple bugs, bad paint jobs, panel gaps, etc, but what's always made it ok was customer service being willing to help and make things right.

I love Tesla and what they've done for the electric car industry but it's super frustrating when the mess up like this and don't even pretend to care. :(

Has this happened to anyone else?

**UPDATE: My car magically appeared back in the app at around midnight.**

**Still love my Tesla's but I've had quite a few frustrating interactions with both sales, service and customer support lately. Really wish they could keep the service I was used too.**

TeslaMotors,frustrating,73mgmm,Negativity experience of buying CPO,"I haven't read any negative post of CPO, so I might be the first/only one. But I am writing to warn others to not make the same mistake that I did and also vent. 

I placed an order for a CPO in mid September. I got an email saying that ot would take 6-8 weeks, which was totally fine. 

Earlier this week, I got a call saying that it is already at the pickup location in Fremont, so I need to schedule a pickup date and arrange the payment. So, I scheduled to pick it up on Friday. I was so excited. 

Come friday, in early afternoon, I received a call saying that the car is not in Fremont but still in Santa Barbara. But since it's their fault and they want to make it right, they offered to ship it to my home instead and would only take a couple of days. And they asked me to just go ahead and arrange the payment. Why would I suspect anything at this moment? Tesla is a very reputable company with good customer service. They wouldn't lie or mislead, right?

Anyhow, I arrange the payments and overnight it. The CPO sales specialist sent a cookie cutter email saying that it will be delivered in 3-5 days. That's not what he said. I called and he told me that they are talking to the transport team and will hear back from them soon. 

Nothing on Friday. So I called him on Saturday morning. They are still trying to arrange the transport. So no firm date yet. Then I asked for a loaner, and he said loaners are not available. My frustration is growing. Last message from him around 7pm on Saturday was that he was still trying to get it delivered ASAP. 

I suspect that they wanted me to make payment on Friday because it was the end of Q3. And I can't help but feeling that they misled me so that they could add one more sales for Q3 without knowing for sure whether they could deliver in a couple of days. 

So here I am, having paid for the car but I don't have the car that I had paid for and don't know when I would get it, frustrated, and getting only same answers. Don't make the same mistakes that I did. Don't pay for the car only with salesperson's words. 

TL:DR - Paid for the car when promised it would be delivered in a couple of days. After payment, Tesla haven't confirmed delivery date. Don't pay for the car before the actual delivery. 

[EDIT1] Ninja correction on a typo. And also reached out to /u/jmc-at-tesla, thanks to /u/venture70 and /u/dieabetic. Probably hear back from someone on Monday. Will update then. 

[EDIT2] /u/jmc-at-tesla just replied that someone will reach out to me today. Will update with the results. 

[EDIT3] Thanks to /u/jmc-at-tesla, someone from Tesla did just reach out, and he promised a loaner tonight and having the actual car delivered at the latest by Wednesday. This is an outcome I am certainly happy with at this moment. Hopefully /u/seenhear also got his situation resolved soon.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,a5dgku,So Tesla Brought Me The Wrong Car Today,"******************UPDATE AS OF 5:00p CST 12/12/18******************


*YESTERDAY, 12/11/18 [date of originally scheduled delivery]*


Last night, 90 mins after refusing delivery of the wrong car (see below), nobody from sales or delivery would return my calls.  I then decided to go to the Chicago Gold Coast store where I had dealt with two OAs to order the white/white P3D.


While in store last night, one of the two OAs **(1)** located a white/white ""not for sale"" P3D at the Highland Park location, and **(2)** got the ""not for sale"" removed for me to take delivery pending mileage/condition price adjustments, if any, all to be determined today.


I don't know why that specific car did not show in inventory before that moment, but there it (allegedly) was.


Understanding my frustration and admitting that he would be equally frustrated and disappointed, the OA assured me that he would work on everything **today** in order ""to make this right.""  This was around 6 or 7pm last night so it was (presumably) a little late to coordinate with other stores or the delivery team at that time.


*TODAY, 12/12/18*


I received a call from a manager with the Chicago delivery team at 10:30 this morning.  He said that the white/white P3D from the Highland Park location was being used for an overnight test drive.  That was why specific details regarding mileage and condition could not be determined last night while I was in store.


The delivery manager then told me that he expected the car back to the Highland Park location by 3pm.  He said that it had 390 miles on it and would be discounted accordingly.  He then said that once it was returned to the Highland Park location, it would be detailed, inspected, and delivered to me tonight.


Just after 3pm, I got another call from the deliver manager.  He informed me that the white/white ""not for sale"" car had finally been returned to the Highland Park location.  Everything seemed to finally be going according to plan, right?  There was a glimmer of hope, right?


No.


**The car located by the Gold Coast OA and tracked by the Chicago delivery manager was not a MP3/3PD**.  It was a non-performance Model 3.  Obviously not *at all* what I ordered, nor what I was told last night or this morning.


*As if everything preceding the phone call weren't already a comedy of errors*, **Tesla didn't even know which Model 3 they were holding for me.**


I then called the Gold Coast sales location again to speak with the OA to see if there was some kind of mixup.  I was hoping that maybe, somehow, the delivery manager was looking at the wrong car in inventory.  But guess what?  The OA with whom I'd been working, talked to last night, and who assured me that he would ""make this right"" is not at work today.  Neither is the other OA with whom I worked.


**Unbelievable.**


So I returned the call to the delivery manager.  He gave me four options: 

(1) take the white/black P3D that was brought and refused yesterday,
(2) take a black/white P3D,
(3) wait for a white/white P3D and cross my fingers for EOY delivery, or
(4) cancel the order.


I asked about waiting for the white/white and, if delivered after 12/31, discounting $3,750 given the myriad errors.  He responded with a firm ""no.""  I then said that, in my opinion, ""this has been a bit of a fiasco.""  He agreed, replying ""I think that's putting it lightly.""


I then pressed him on how other car manufacturers or dealers would almost certainly do something to make this right.  The delivery manager knows the whole story so I didn't need to repeat the details.  I told him about how an Acura dealership threw in all-weather floor mats when they were late delivering a transferred vehicle (though it was the correct vehicle).  I also said how a Lexus dealership threw in free car washes and took $1,000 off the price of a car because they, also, were wrong about the specs on a car for which I drove over an hour specifically to see.


Specifically, I asked about floor mats, supercharging, or anything he could do to restore a little bit of faith in the company after this ordeal.  He said he could do floor mats and two years of service.


I accepted that offer for the black exterior/white interior M3P.  It should be delivered in a few hours.


I still have a sour taste in my mouth about this entire process.  This has been a true comedy of errors.  I would list all of the errors/mishaps but I am too tired and frustrated to deal count them right now.  Maybe I'll list them in a few days when I'm (hopefully) less frustrated.


On the bright side, I will be saving money on a non-premium paint (although I adored the white exterior), floor mats, and two years of service (although I'm not exactly sure what that includes, so I can't determine that value).  That should total at least $1,500.  I also don't have to anxiously hope that a white/white will be delivered by EOY.  I am thankful for all of that.


However, *and what I thought was needless to say until I tried to order a car from Tesla*, I would have been far happier with the car I ordered.  Apparently that's too much to ask.  Literally, it's too much to ask.  I asked today about pulling a white/white P3D from anywhere else given this nonsense.  The answer was a hard ""no.""


Yes, I could have chosen to wait for the car I wanted, white/white, and paid the extra $3,750 in tax.  However, that was not the expectation.  That was not the promise.  That was not the deal.


Should I have ordered earlier to guarantee delivery by EOY?  Sure, but I wasn't sure that I wanted this car.  Moreover, that was *supposed* to be a non-issue according to Sales/OAs when I placed the order.  That was supposed to be a non-issue when I spoke with the OA last night.  And that was supposed to be a non-issue when I spoke with the delivery manager this morning.


**I'll conclude with this:**  let this be a lesson of how badly things can go when ordering a Tesla.  *I didn't even know that it was possible to screw something up so badly.*  Additionally, prospective buyers should look through the comments here and read about how others have experienced similar mishaps/mismatches with delivery: wrong cars, wrong VINs, wrong wheels, wrong leather, wrong colors, bad paint, etc.  I sincerely hope that this was a worst-case scenario.  I hope that no other consumers or fans of this company experience such a nightmare.


**Bottom line: if you order a Tesla, ask yourself what you're willing to settle for in case something else shows up.**




******************ORIGINAL POST ON 12/11/18******************




Tesla delivered the wrong car today.


What was supposed to be an absolutely *elating* day turned into utter disappointment. I was beyond excited to get my M3P. I saw the white car pull up (home delivery) and I was in complete awe. So much awe, in fact, that I nearly missed the issue.


The delivery rep stepped out of the car, and that's when my wife noticed the problem. I was too busy drooling over the body curves, 20"" wheels, and brake calipers. That's when my wife told me that the interior was black. I ordered white/white.


I informed the rep of the issue and he called the local delivery department. Given that today is 12/11, the rep told me that it would be nearly impossible to get me a white/white by EOY for the tax credit. Rep gave me three options:

(1) take the white/black he brought,
(2) take a black/white available in local inventory, or
(3) cross my fingers for a white/white by EOY.


The complete oversight regarding actually *fixing* the issue is what frustrates me more than anything. Mistakes happen. I understand that. I don't think auto manufacturers should be delivering the wrong cars, especially at this price point, but mistakes happen. Whatever.


However, there was absolutely no concern of *""Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry this happened! We'll get to the bottom of it and fix it immediately.""* The response was, effectively, ""take one of these two other cars, or take your chances with the tax credit.""


I ultimately decided not to take the car.


I told the rep that the paperwork clearly shows that this is the wrong car. He said he would go back to the local delivery center and see what he could do. I offered to give him the paperwork (he said that his paperwork didn't show the discrepancy) but he didn't want it. An hour later, he asked me to send him my paperwork.


I then called the dealership that I worked with and they said they would work on fixing the issue.  It seems that sales and delivery are two **very** separate departments with minimal (if any) overlap. 


Sales said they found another white/white locally which had been reserved as not for sale. They said that they could get it for me given the circumstances. However, a car marked ""not for sale"" seems to indicate that it is/was a loaner or test drive vehicle which is certainly not the brand new car I ordered. If so, I guess I have to decide if I want to take that or not.


Overall, I'm very frustrated with Tesla and their customer service, especially re the delivery department. Their behavior makes me wonder if they're trying to push inventory as quickly as possible by hoping that consumers will settle on variations of the cars they actually ordered, especially given the pressure to take delivery by EOY. Consumers are in a tough spot in December when faced with the possibility of losing $3,500 if Tesla doesn't deliver.


I'm also shocked that an auto manufacturer can (based on forum posts elsewhere) have so many examples of delivering wrong cars. Messing up an order on a car is ridiculous and unacceptable.


Tesla has one job: deliver cars. It's baffling to me that they can deliver the wrong car. I'm now rethinking whether I want any Tesla regardless of whether they can find the right configuration. This experience doesn't exactly instill hope or trust in a company without a long track record.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,as4bav,[Discussion] Why I think you should not prepay for FSD,"People have been asking me in HW3 threads on reddit and on TMC if they should prepay for FSD (to lock-in the current pricing) and separately if they should wait for the newer HW3-equipped cars instead of buying now.
So in order to make my answers more visible I am doing this, feel free to chime in with your perspective too.

So I'll start with a word of caution: Tesla's history of fulfilling retrofit promises is not exactly great (remember they'd rather you buy a new car - a lot more profit that way):

- (paid!) P90D->P100D battery upgrade took a lot longer than promised and was filled with frustration: https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/2556184/
- Lighted vanity mirrors - did not happen: https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/169977/
- AP1 development will continue despite HW2 arrival: did not happen
- ""Your car will meet you at the porch"" summon - did not happen, people that tried to pursue it (on ap1) were told ""if it's not in the manual, it was not promised""
- For new model 3 owners - also consider the wording in the purchase agreement (not sure if same in CN and EU): h/t https://twitter.com/scottwolf_arch/status/1066314684863795200

> [Prior agreements, oral statements, negotiations, communications or representations about the Vehicle sold under this Agreement are superseded by this Agreement. Terms relating to the purchase not expressly contained herein are not binding](https://www.tesla.com/order/download-order-agreement?country=US)
So don't just blindly trust what the tesla.com says, only trust what the purchase agreement lists! AP1 owners never got what they were promised.

Also since the ""promise"" was to only to retrofit a new computer - if you are on a HW2.0 car - you'd be with the old worse Bosch radar and RCCC cameras (= no dashcam), and no redundancy. Retrofitting new radar and ep. the e-fuses is very unlikely - major wiring harness change!

And god-forbid there's another sensor suite change meanwhile - that would mean even hw2.5 would be on subpar sensor suite with unknown performance. (I am not saying it's likely, but it is possible and it happened before very stealthily, remember the first [""hw2.5 is nothingburger"" statements from Tesla!](https://electrek.co/2017/08/09/tesla-autopilot-2-5-hardware-computer-autonomous-driving/) ) 

Also remember, when you pay cash at time of upgrade (even if price is somewhat more), you will likely get much higher priority vs when you already paid so there's no downside to place you last in line (see model3 reservations for example of how this played out).

And the there's not even a timeline when HW3 would actually make any meaningful difference in performance, after all current software is not even at the promised EAP level (and it's been 2+ years since EAP was finished and was only undergoing final testing and validation, if you believe original announcement. Meanwhile here in the real world we are on 3rd total rewrite of the codebase and cannot even read the speed signs yet)

Look at all the people that prepaid FSD back in 2016 - how well did it work for them? And as they say final 10% of work take 95% of time.

Also did you know first batch of hw2.5 was stealth-recalled due to overheating problems? Unlikely any retrofits would happen until HW stabilizes - who knows how long it takes, and the happy new owners of hw3 cars might be not so happy for quite a while initially (just look at hw2 owners).

Also consider crash risks - if you get into an accident, chances are the car would be totalled so whatever software-only upgrades you have would be lost (FSD is NOT transferrable between cars).

So you see, there are lots of risks and the upside is just fixing the price of a potential upgrade who knows when, if at all? (what if HW3 will not achieve FSD and HW4 would be needed in another few years? and HW3 is to only achieve full EAP promised stuff (like that smart summon)?) There's also a very real chance the price cannot be retroactively increased for existing owners because of how the current price is advertised.

With all of this in mind - I don't recommend you to prepay for FSD. Enjoy what you have now! When the time comes you can evaluate the options in a lot more informed way. Assuming you still have the car and like what you see and so on.

I should add that I prepaid for FSD in Jan 2017 and then regretted it. But because Tesla bought back my car as a lemon for the full price in December 2017, I had a rare chance of a do-over and I sure did nto make that mistake again when I bought another one in March 2018.

In a similar vein, if you REALLY want a Tesla car and can afford it NOW - buy it now and enjoy a known quantity. If you cannot afford it now or if you don't LIKE what's offered now, then wait until you can afford it or when something you like is offered and look at everything at that point in time. It's really hard to predict the future after all.

I know some people consider the prepayment money as a grant to Tesla to speed up the development - if you truly believe in something like this, there are still better ways that better protect you:
- You can invest in Tesla stock and if FSD happens - imagine the explosion in the stock price that would follow! And these money are transferrable to your next Tesla should there be a delay in development or something happened to your old car too!
- You can also invest the money in some other ways and be diversified (which apparently is very important too according to investment advisors)
- If you want it to be a free gift to Elon/Tesla - do it as a free gift instead - it allows them to have more cash without incurring the liability on the book so the benefit is again bigger

- In the end it's your money of course, but do choose wisely, I am sure you worked hard to earn them!

EDIT - addition from another comment below: since I checked what FSD actually affords you in mytesla page, I was a bit shocked. Here's the full description:

> Full Self-Driving Capability

> All you will need to do is get in and tell your car where to go and your Tesla will figure out the optimal route. Please note that Self-Driving functionality is dependent upon extensive software validation and regulatory approval which may vary widely by jurisdiction. BUY

So.. a glorified navigation no actual driving involved? This nicely aligns with Elon's remarks from the last earnings call that ""we already have FSD on highways"" implying NoA IS FSD (perhaps with ULC sprinkled in once deemed safe)",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/as4bav/discussion_why_i_think_you_should_not_prepay_for/,greentheonly,34731.0,0.9985
TeslaMotors,frustrating,em2clm,Tesla - Excellent cars absolute worst possible customer service.,"New Tesla model 3 owner as of only December here. A quick review of Yelp informed me I was not alone with this experience so figured I would take it to reddit.

I am absolutely shocked at the blatant disregard of their customer's satisfaction with the buying and owning process. 

Bought the car online as no dealers are in my state, believe it or not I had a few questions along the way. Email communication net about a 25% Tesla reply rate. Of those replies approximately 50% of my questions would be answered averaging about 2 questions in an email. Couldn't bulk email as I would either think of a new question or have a follow up to their vague answer.

Attempted text, while reply rate was better at approx 50% usually the response had nothing to do with my question. When calling the number provided over text the sales associate told me ""either buy it or don't"".

Preemptively ordered a charging adapter- So I could charge my car(important right?). Was informed it would arrive on X date   which was 2 days after I was expected to take delivery. Day before I went to take delivery checked the status and the shipper had yet to receive the item. I contacted service 3 times to either expedite or cancel. You guessed it, 0% reply rate. The item arrived a week later. Fortunately Tesla had one in stock at my pick up location. I only had to wait in the service line for an hour. Fortunately my delivery appointment was well behind schedule so I only needed to wait another hour. Now I have two....

Finally the rep refused to fill dealership rebate paperwork out for me and told me he would email the  paperwork. I called the state rebate program who informed me the dealership was aware and had to complete it. I have been attempting to resolve this at about a 10% reply rate. I'll be calling. It is likely I will miss the rebate window and this will end up in small claims.

The car itself. Holy hell it's awesome. Impressed by something new everyday. The customer service itself though leaves much to be desired. I'm beginning to regret the decision due to lack of support.

Tldr: car is sweet. Tesla service has dropped the ball at every opportunity and may cost me my rebate.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/em2clm/tesla_excellent_cars_absolute_worst_possible/,DobermanAG,14581.0,0.8199
TeslaMotors,frustrating,cb1f6h,This car (M3AWDLR) has changed road trips for me forever,"This last weekend I took my first road trip from NY to Boston (Phish at Fenway!) and the experience could not have been more fun. I left  with about 90% in the tank, went nearly full AP all the way to East Greenwich Supercharger, plugged in (was at about 20%) and walked over to the Panera, ordered food, bathroom break and walked back to the car. When we got back, that 150kw max pump had filled me up over 80%. Final cost? $6 plus the turkey sandwich and chips. 

The ride back? Even smoother. We stopped at a typical rest area stop on I95 and it had 2 superchargers waiting and a Carvel. 10 mins and a little over $3 in power, and a thick chocolate shake later, made it back home to NY with plenty in reserve. The thing that made it so much more enjoyable was the fact that in all the post holiday traffic (and it was ALOT), I never felt frustrated, tired, or anxious. AP handled a the heavy lifting during the stop and go and slow moving traffic. We sat back, listened to music, recapped the weekend, laughed, and just let the car take us home. 

TL;DR Road trip to Boston, huge success, now planning more road trips. This car is magic. My ride or die. 12/10",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/cb1f6h/this_car_m3awdlr_has_changed_road_trips_for_me/,Resevdog,5697.0,0.9133

TeslaMotors,frustrating,6ucpbr,Some thoughts on switching back from Tesla to ICE,"So, I blew it.  After 2 years of Tesla ownership, about 3ish months ago I threw in the towel.  I over-reached in getting my P85 at the price that I did, I was falling behind and it wasn't getting better.  I switched to a perfectly serviceable and brand new Chrysler 300 because their lease rebate program they had managed to entirely wipe out how underwater I was on the Tesla! Now I've got a La-Z-Boy on wheels, full-on grandpa mode.  Comfy suspension, big ol' boat of a car (slightly bigger than the Model S), ridiculously plush seating, all that jazz.  As for bells-and-whistles, I think I'm pretty close to feature parity.  No autopilot on either, wireless keyfob that doesn't leave my pocket on both, automatic driver profiles, etc etc.  For a trade-down, I'm pretty happy with it.

That said, I've now experienced the transition to EV and another one to ICE, and I gotta say it was a lot easier getting used to an EV than it was getting used to an ICE.  Here are some semi-organized thoughts on the matter - *trying* to focus specifically on the EV vs ICE thing.

**Road trips:**  

Coincidentally, I got both cars shortly before long-distance road trips.  ([Here's the Tesla trip](http://imgur.com/a/cGWq2), and the Chrysler trip was around 3,500 miles.)  I'd say that I got about the same amount of mileage out of each day of driving regardless of car.  The Chrysler's ventilated seats made the drive slightly more comfortable.  Stopping for gas was honestly worse than stopping at the Superchargers for me.  With the superchargers, I had a waypoint to aim for and I knew exactly how long it'd be between stops - there wasn't any thinking about it or hemming and hawing about maybe seeing if the next station had slightly cheaper gas.  I mean I appreciate flexibility, but the superchargers won out on account of being one less thing to think about.

**Driveability:**

Good lord it's annoying how long gas engines take to respond.  I really was not prepared for how frustrating that's been, especially getting around town.  In the Tesla, the only thing you have to think about is how hard you're hitting the pedal - it responds instantly and the same way every time.  In the Chrysler, I'm *still* not used to it.  That small delay between your action and the car's response is just *really* throwing me off.  I'll pull away from stop signs either super slow or revving the shit out of the engine more often than someone who's been driving a decade should.  

And then there's the whole gear shift thing.  That one's less bad because in automatic mode it usually happens around the same time and the engine's sound tells you when it's gonna happen.  In manual (paddle shifter) mode it's even better.  The car before these two was a Civic Hybrid with a CVT so it's been several years since my last gear shift and I didn't miss it.  Minor annoyance overall.

Slowing down is still weird.  The car still feels out of control because of the lack of regenerative braking.  I really appreciated that the 'no input' mode of an EV is that it'll slow down pretty quickly, seems safer that way.  I've adapted my braking habits to more closely match an EV's slowdown and it's really noticeable that I'm slowing down further back from the light than a lot of people.  

Haven't really had inclement weather yet so I don't have any thoughts there.  This is my first car with AWD though, I'm curious to see how it handles the winter.

**Logistics:**

The Chrysler's also got a wireless keyfob system, never take the keys out of my pocket.  It's nice!  That said, it took me a couple weeks to stop leaving the engine running.

I'm about due for an oil change, maintenance is obviously gonna be more often than on the Tesla.  Same size tires at least, so I know what to expect price-wise.

With the exception of the road trip, I have more often than not waited until the low fuel light started bugging me to fill the car up.  I didn't realize how much of a habit change it is to just plug in when you get home at night.

Speaking of fuel, hooooo *boy* is it uncomfortable paying at the pump every fill-up what used to get added to my electric bill in a month.  This is not an efficient car, fortunately the lease on it incentivizes me to not drive it all that often.

**Conclusion:**

I really think that we're just used to ICE cars rather than them being actually easier or better.  When you grow up with it and there's nothing else to compare it to, of course it's gonna be normal.  I feel like I spent long enough on an EV to 'forget' about ICE driving and it's clear based on my preferences that it's a no-contest win for EVs.  I dunno how much of it's about Tesla *really* getting things right and how much is just EVs being inherently easier to use but man, 2 years 9 months left on this lease.  I can't wait until I get my shit together enough to get back into an EV.

There was a spot on Colorado Boulevard where the car would always try to get into the left lane no matter what even if a right turn was coming up, and for the first time, it didn‚Äôt do that this morning. 

Turns are a lot smoother and accurate, and the car doesn‚Äôt wait and pause confused as much. I made 3 trips this morning, in traffic and the car did great on all 3. After being pretty frustrated with the beta I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic today, finally. Not sure how this release has been for you all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/y1ar17/20222018_106923_fsd_beta_seems_notably_improved/,Keg199er,11196.0,0.1169

Everything has improved incredibly, except this daily frustration. I'm not sure if this is because their staff lives in dry climates or what, but this is driving me crazy. I'm ashamed to give test drives to people on rainy days because of the consistent ""What? really?? I have to tap buttons on the screen multiple times?"" reaction people give.

This is especially aggravated when the wiper buttons are covered by the seat belt alert which show up intermittently when there's a bag on the back seat. Now it adds an annoyingly slow swipe before taps.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,bpsobe,In defense of autopilot.,"I am getting frustrated that every autopilot accident is now national news, which breaks down into rhetoric about how the system is questionable.

I understand, I‚Äôm probably preaching to the choir here, but a common theme to these accidents is that the system is not being used properly.  The accidents all seem to be drivers not paying attention, not having their hands on wheel, etc.

This is not a Tesla problem, it‚Äôs a human problem.  I see the same thing in an alarming number of vehicles that do not have driver assist.  It‚Äôs scary how many drivers have their face buried in their phone.  Throw in those that change lanes without looking, randomly veer into my lane, etc.  I think when I‚Äôm using auto pilot that I‚Äôm paying more attention than most drivers without.

I wish the conversation would switch to an honest discussion about how when used properly, the system is safe, rather than the stories we are getting now.  I admit it‚Äôs got a ways to go before level 5...but when I have autopilot on, I can pay attention to the big picture more, rather than micro managing everything the car is doing.  This lets me avoid dangerous situations before they develop.  I have to take over sometimes...who cares.  Without autopilot, I had to do all the driving, as opposed to like 5-10% of the highway driving now.

A perfect system is a great goal, but in the meantime, I feel like I am safer when I am using auto pilot and paying attention than without it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/bpsobe/in_defense_of_autopilot/,Ryrors,13883.0,0.9209
TeslaMotors,frustrating,90kwq9,Harassment from Short Sellers drove WSJ Reviewer Dan Neil to delete his Twitter.,">In what looks like a coordinated attack from Mark Spiegel, Montana  Skeptic, and others, Pulitzer Prize winner and Wall Street Journal's  auto reviewer Dan Neil [deleted his Twitter account](https://twitter.com/danneilwsj) after writing [a glowing review of the Model 3 Performance version](https://www.wsj.com/articles/first-ever-review-of-the-tesla-model-3-performance-a-thrilling-modern-marvel-1532022533). It appears that short sellers were completely blindsided this week by a combination of the WSJ's review and [Munro's teardown revelations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAS-yjWj9DY).  In both the review's comment section and Dan Neil's twitter, he was  criticized harshly in what presumably looks like a mountain of  frustration unleashed by short sellers. Dan Neil, being an tough but  honest automotive review defended himself in both places. Considering  the comment section of any news article can be like the wild west,  especially in an article like this, Dan must've had a fervent resolve in  believing what he wrote. Others even reacted with surprise to his  bravery. Still others expressed their support or were positively  receptive to his review.  
>  
>However today, after hours of harassment from short sellers over trivial  things like why he hasn't test driven the barely available I-Pace  (especially given that this is his first review of the Model 3), Dan  Neil deleted his Twitter account. Multiple people have taken note of  this, including Montana Skeptic who [boomed with pride calling Dan a ""worshiper""](https://twitter.com/MontanaSkeptic1/status/1020426127083491329) (and [Mark B. Spiegal](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/attachments/ms-tweet-png.318646/)). This is especially curious as Dan Neil famously bet against Elon Musk that Tesla [wouldn't be able to deliver a practical EV to its customers by the end of 2012](https://www.autoguide.com/auto-news/2012/06/auto-journalist-dan-neil-loses-tesla-model-s-bet-writes-1000-check-to-charity.html),  the Model S. Upon Tesla fulfilling their promises, Dan made good on the  friendly bet and donated $1000 to Doctors without Borders.  
>  
>But given how haters have been seriously critical over these mysterious  ""Musk Bros"" attacking anyone who Elon Musk disagrees with on Twitter, I  felt it was important to bring this to light to a larger audience. In  fact it makes me wonder... Are those ""Musk Bros"" even Elon fans? Or  perhaps it's yet another smear campaign launched by haters. Post  thoughts, feelings, or more information below.

**Edit:** [Autonews reporter](http://www.autonews.com/staff/urvaksh-karkaria) claims that the twitter mob was [responsible for Dan deleting his twitter](https://twitter.com/Urvaksh/status/1020390138474647553).

TeslaMotors,frustrating,ef96xj,Tesla sold my already paid for model S,"I‚Äôve been trying to resolve this issue with Tesla for several weeks, and haven‚Äôt come to any conclusion because of lack of communication and support received from Tesla‚Äôs team. 

After several months of searching for the Tesla I wanted, 2019 Model S P100d I finally found a showroom model at the Florida Tesla location and placed my deposit thinking I‚Äôve secured it. I completed the registration required by Tesla, got my MVPA with Tesla with the VIN, got it financed, and the payment was sent to Tesla within 5 days of securing my dream car. However, the following week I received an email from the compliance department stating my car, that I had already paid for was cancelled. I tried contacting the compliance department, but I got no response. I was shocked and confused as I got an email confirmation from Tesla stating that they have receive and accepted my payment and set a delivery date, I got this email after the compliance department contacted me. 

So I called my OA (owner advisors) and he informed me that my car was in queue for registration in Texas. Then I called the Tesla showroom in Florida to clear up the confusion and I was assured that the car was still under my name and was still mine and hadn‚Äôt been cancelled. And that my car was at a offsite location being ready for pickup. Although, I had gotten a lot of reassurance from the Tesla Florida team members, the email still did not make sense nor did I receive any furthers communication from the compliance department ie till Monday. 

On Monday compliance department called me and confirmed that the issue would be taken care off and I would soon be contacted by the delivery specialist within 24 hours of our conversation. I was then contacted by the delivery specialist via email confirming that I was getting the same car, same VIN, 2019 model S p100d, that I paid for but that I just needed a new RN (reservation number) for which a link was included in the email. It instructed me to pay the deposit again and so I did. At this time, I was completely reassured that the email from the compliance department was a miscommunication from Tesla‚Äôs side and that it have been rectified and my car was back on track for delivery with no issues in sight. I could finally relax after days of trying to get an answer and be excited about my long awaited car.

Couple of days later, I received a phone call from the same delivery specialist that I had been in touch with. He called and told me that there was bad news and good news. He started off with the bad news, telling me that the car that I had already paid for was sold to someone else during the time my car was cancelled by the compliance department. He went on to tell me the ‚Äúgood news‚Äù that they had a similar model S but 2018 version. By this point I had no words, to understand such unprofessional behaviour from ‚Äúreputable‚Äù company like Tesla. 

I was still trying my best to be as understanding one could be in this situation, and so I asked if they could accommodate me with the car similar to the car I paid for. He said he couldn‚Äôt do anything else and that this was the only deal as close to my 2019 model S. So I said fine, and he sent me a link to the new RN and that I had pay a deposit again. 
By this point I had paid three deposits, ONE full payment for my 2019 model S and still had NO CAR. 

After I had paid the third deposit, I spoke to the delivery specialist expressing my disappointment and asked for them to at least pay for the delivery to compensate for all the distress and downgrade of car. And to my
Surprise the Tesla delivery specialist said ‚Äúthis is a take it or leave it deal‚Äù and that he could not anything to compensate for all the problems caused by Tesla. 

A few days go by of me trying to contact anyone at Tesla, I reached out to all the point of contact I had within Tesla, the compliance department, and legal department to further discuss this issue as they had assured me multiple times that I would get my already paid for 2019 model S. But I have yet to receive any means of contact from Tesla. Then I get contacted by Houston Tesla delivery department informing me that the 2018 model S is at the body shop getting repairs, which I was not aware of that car needed any repairs, and that I would not be able to get the delivery before the end of the year. 

This is what‚Äôs been currently happening, I understand that it‚Äôs holiday season but it is very frustrating not receiving any communication from Tesla. Is there any advice  on how I should handle the situation or who I should contact at Tesla to get this resolved. As I am currently making payments for a car I do not even have. And I would personally like to get the car that I paid for, a 2019 Model S verses a damaged 2018.

TLDR:  Ordered and paid for a 2019 model S P100d and Tesla ended up selling that VIN number and is trying to get me a 2018 Model S.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ef96xj/tesla_sold_my_already_paid_for_model_s/,moh77068,2175.0,0.4326

TeslaMotors,frustrating,t2t9c4,My Experience with Tesla (2 months in),"  Hello, I really just need to get this off my chest as I‚Äôve had an absolutely horrible experience with Tesla so far and I‚Äôm kind of at a loss for how to proceed. Since taking delivery of my M3LR on December 20th it has just been one issue after another. It seems that there is no accountability within Tesla and they have no interest in making the situation right for me. It has been 2 months, I currently have no heat in my car and had to book my 3rd service appointment for this issue, among others. I live in Winnipeg, Canada, and having no heat is beyond unacceptable. Sorry for the incoming wall of text.

Here is a rundown on how my Tesla experience has been.

¬∑ December 20th, 2021 ‚Äì Took delivery, noticed a couple small issues ‚Äì a gouge in the dash, a misshapen rear head rest. No big deal, it can all get fixed after I get it home. I had around a 12 hour drive to get home, and immediately after getting on the highway I noticed that the rear passenger side window was not sealing, causing very loud wind noise in the cabin. I called in to my sales rep, and his answer was that this is normal and I just need to open it and close it a bunch of times to fix it. I asked him to help me book a service appointment, he said no, as this was a ‚Äúnormal issue‚Äù. 

¬∑ On the way home I had my first instance of the heat failing. I lost heat completely on the highway and my HVAC was blowing cold air. This caused my windows to frost over so I could not see. This was extremely dangerous and I had to find somewhere to pull over. After doing a reset on the car it came back on (around 30 minutes later).

¬∑ This issue persisted, and I had to book a service appointment to get it fixed. Side note, I cannot book a local service appointment. The app makes me book for the service center in Minneapolis and then send a message requesting to have it sent to my local service team. It seems crazy that I have to initially book for service in another country before getting help, and this will be relevant later. The earliest service appointment I was able to book was January 12.

¬∑ January 12th, 2022 ‚Äì Brought my Tesla in for service for the following issues: Rear passenger side window not sealing, gouge on the dash, misshapen headrest, heat not working, center console USB not working with data.

¬∑ Picked up same day, I was informed that the window and headrest had been fixed, the heat issue was fixed with a firmware update, the dash had not come in yet, and that the USB ports would not be fixed, as this was a change in the 2022 models. I said that I was not okay with this and wanted them to upgrade my USB ports to ones with a data connection. Without USB ports in the center console I do not have the newest games that have launched, I do not have the ability to play music from a pen drive (the app is not on my car because it does not have data USB ports), and to use things like the light show I have to remove my dash cam USB drive, or partition it and lose space for my dash cam and sentry mode. The service rep said he would have his manager call me to come up with a solution.

¬∑ The service manager calls me, tells me that they would not be fixing the USB port issue. He told me that this was never an advertised feature of this car and that I did not lose any functionality due to not having it. He said that unless it was expressly mentioned to me in writing by my sales rep I should not have expected to receive it. I asked him if he thought that it was good business for their clients to have to get every single feature the car comes with in writing from their SC, or they may not receive it. He said that he was not prepared for this call, apologized for that, and said he would call me back.

¬∑ The sales manager calls me instead, he was a bit more understanding and seemed to have a grasp on why I would want this USB data functionality. He again reiterated that it was never an advertised feature and that it is not something that I should have expected when purchasing the car. I told him that I found this ridiculous, as these are features that they advertise and mention often. I mentioned recent tweets from Elon Musk stating ‚Äúevery Tesla is getting Sonic!‚Äù and asked him why I should not have expected that I would also receive this. He again told me that I was wrong for expecting this, regardless of any media showing these features in the car. They told me that I should be receiving this at some point in the future, but could not provide a guarantee. I told him I was still dissatisfied, he said that the general manager would contact me.

¬∑ The general manager contacted me, we rehashed the same points as on the previous call. He was more understanding and admitted that not sending out a communication that these features would not be included was an oversight. He did agree that it was unrealistic to expect a client to read the user manual prior to receiving their car in order to learn of this feature being removed and that it should have been better communicated. Despite this, he once again told me that there was nothing that he could do for me. They offered a $150 service credit, I asked why I would need this on a new under warranty car. They offered me a $100 store credit which I declined as well, I had already spent more than $100 on controllers and a USB drive prior to receiving the car. I told him that I would not accept a compensation that I did not consider fair. He said there was nothing else that they would do.

¬∑ February 8 - My second service appointment. I brought it in to have the dash replaced, heat fixed (again), and the rear passenger window fixed again, because the previous repair only lasted a few days. My local service rep has been great to deal with and has really tried his best to make everything right, which I appreciate. He replaced the dash, replaced the in cabin temperature sensor to correct the heating issue, and replaced the window seal to fix the window issue. I had also asked them to take a look at a creak coming from the driver‚Äôs door that shows up when it is cold, unfortunately the day I brought it in was the warmest day we‚Äôve had all winter and the noise was not happening. No big deal, I‚Äôll send them a video and bring it back when it‚Äôs cold again. This is when the service rep informed me that Tesla only covers issues like these when they require a part. If I bring the car in again for this issue and they either don‚Äôt find the issue, or they find the issue and it does not require a part to fix, they will charge me the diagnostic and repair cost. This is unbelievable to me. This is not an inexpensive car and I‚Äôve never had another brand tell me something like this. As I mentioned, the local rep is great and said that if I send him a video with the noise he‚Äôll do a diagnostic and repair without charging me, even if it doesn‚Äôt require a part. While I appreciate this, it still seems absolutely ridiculous that they would charge for this in the first place.

¬∑ February 26 ‚Äì I was going out for the day to do some running around and when I got out to my garage I did not hear the HVAC, weird. I got in the car and saw a notification that the   
 climate keeper was unavailable due to a system fault. I did a reset on the car hoping to fix the issue, but when it restarted I received another error that the climate control required service and that heat would be reduced or unavailable. This is a huge issue, as I live in a very cold climate and every time I have booked a service appointment it takes them nearly a month to be let in. I went to book the service appointment, as mentioned earlier I cannot book a local appointment. I booked for the closest location, in Minneapolis and asked for them to forward it to my local service team.

¬∑ I received a response back stating that the mobile service team would not be able to fix this issue and I needed to bring it in to a service center. So I have two options, drive 8 hours and in to another country, or drive 12 hours to the service  center in Saskatoon, Canada. Again, with no heat in the winter. I told them that this would not be possible, I still have not received a response other than a notification asking me to approve the estimate.

¬∑ I called in to speak to service over the phone, the rep was very helpful and said that this information was incorrect and that my local service team could handle the repair. He said he would redirect the ticket to them and mark it with high urgency so that I would receive a call back the same day. He did neither of those things. I still have no heat and a service appointment booked for a different country tomorrow morning at 9:30am.

I‚Äôm not sure what to do at this point. Yesterday was fortunately a very warm day, but today it is cold again and I can‚Äôt really do too much running around in my car. When the heat doesn‚Äôt work it causes the windows to fog up and creates unsafe driving conditions. I‚Äôll be calling back in once the service line opens today hoping to make some progress, but at this point I don‚Äôt have any confidence in the car or Tesla as a company to make this situation right for me.

I am looking at opening an arbitration claim with camvap.ca to help me get this fixed with Tesla, but I‚Äôm not sure if this will help me at all either. It looks like the end result in these arbitrations is that the manufacturer will buy back the car, which doesn‚Äôt really help me either. I do not want to go back to an ICE vehicle, and any other electric vehicle will not have the supercharger network allowing me to travel across the country. I really do love this car when it is working properly, the minimalistic interior is amazing and it is so fun to drive, but I simply cannot look past all of these issues I‚Äôve had since taking delivery. I really understand now what everyone says about it being a great car, but bad company.

Again, sorry for the wall of text. I‚Äôm really just typing this to get my frustrations out, I know this isn‚Äôt going to make any difference. Sorry for the formatting as well and all the long winded points, I know this probably isn‚Äôt very easy to read.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/t2t9c4/my_experience_with_tesla_2_months_in/,CMusky,624.0,0.9978
TeslaMotors,frustrating,u61hfc,Painfully slow state of Tesla navigation map in v11,"This is a video of a trip planned in my 2021 Model 3 LR navigation system:

https://reddit.com/link/u61hfc/video/9xl6up13x6u81/player

I know that my vehicle was one of the last few shipped with the old Intel processors. But still, [before v11, the navigation system was working perfectly fine](https://youtu.be/hf_uzxVRXJE?t=565) (video from 3 years ago), even on Intel SKUs older than mine. How is this behaving on legacy models/MCU?

It is not only frustrating to use when trying to pinpoint parking lots, lanes or precise locations on arrival, but also embarrassing to passenger who see this ""giant iPad"" perform slower than a cheapo 89$ Android phone from 2017. And this is not even exaggerating, those phone will rip through Google Maps faster than a Tesla.

The system has performance to spare, and as shown in the video it works fine with satellite view. It keeps buttery smooth 60fps in animations or even while moving around the map itself, but it seems like the actual loading and rendering of tiles is completely broken and/or unoptimised software-wise.

Note: I show in the video the full LTE reception, but it still does this on 1Gbit WiFi. System was also freshly rebooted. To be fair it doesn't always hang up -this badly-, but 90% of the time the experience is really really frustrating.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,7woloy,[Discussion] I attended The Boring Company's Culver City Presentation. I'm concerned about its ability to win public trust. (x-post from r/technology),"I attended the Boring Company's January 22 presentation to the City Council of the City of Culver City (this is legitimately how they refer to themselves), where they pitched their plan to burrow underneath the town as part of their ‚ÄúPhase 1‚Äù 6.5 mile tunnel. I went with the intention to simply gather information for my podcast, and left with the sinking feeling that the company is biting off more than it can chew.

The Boring Company presenters themselves were competent, capable, and as well-prepared as I imagine they could have been, considering the circumstances. (I'll get to that in a bit.) My two main takeaways from that City Council meeting were:

**1.)** There's a vast difference between selling private goods and winning public trust

**2.)** Any company will struggle to succeed when their CEO (by his own admission) dedicates ""2 or 3 percent"" of his time to it.

Let's backup, and discuss how the Council meeting went before The Boring Company gave their presentation and fielded questions. It shines a light on how much of public work is a slow grind of competing interests, and a stark contrast to the ""move fast and break things"" mentality of many technology companies.

A Boy Scout was invited to the front of the room to lead all of us in the Pledge of Allegiance. And after Vice Mayor Thomas Small discussed the upcoming ""Kindness Week"" at Culver City Middle School, eight residents were each given two minutes to speak on their chosen topic. (I'm not sure how these eight were chosen specifically.) A selection:

One man complained about Film LA‚Äôs (the organization that oversees film permits in the Los Angeles area) abuse of Culver City parking. He was quite emotional and infuriated.

Another speaker - a poet - read a couple poems she had written, one comparing Congresspeople to Baboons.

Yet another discussed permitting requests for proposed cannabis retail stores. 

An elderly man *demanded* the city repair and maintain stop lights. It must have struck a nerve because about half the room applauded when he finished.

After the eight speakers had each had their say, Boring Company's Operations Coordinator Jehn Balajadia gave her presentation. She touched on many of the points available at [The Boring Company's FAQ](https://www.boringcompany.com/faq/).

More importantly, I want to discuss the response from the Council and the public. After Balajadia ended her initial 10 minute presentation, five pre-selected Culver City residents came up to ask their questions.

1.) Marleen Pugach said she didn't want experimental tunnels dug under her neighborhood, which she said is ‚Äúunder seige‚Äù

2.) Judi Sherman had questions about community impact

3.) Ken Mand was a champion of the tunnel and its technology but had important questions about its ultimate effect on the city‚Äôs residents. 

4.) Daniel Lee was excited to see the presentation. But he wanted the city to strongly take into account the proposed access points for entering and exiting the tunnel. Also, he was concerned about the small size of the pods and wished they held more people. He also wanted to encourage local hire, within LA and explicitly Culver City. 

5.) Alex Fish said that although Boring Company was not asking for public cash, they were in effect asking for capital via access to public land that could be used for other means. He had concerns that - if the company were to dissolve - who would be left ""holding the bag"" to guard the tunnel and its access points?

City Councilwoman Meghan Sahli-Wells was the most critical of the five Council Members, and not without reason. Her questions were pointed, and she took issue with comments Musk had made about public transit in December, when he said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pain in the ass. That‚Äôs why everyone doesn‚Äôt like it. And there‚Äôs like a bunch of random strangers, one of who might be a serial killer."" 

Sahli-Wells wasn't sure if someone (from her POV) as openly hostile to public projects as Musk was the right person to be leading one.

And - taking off my Musk Fanboy Hat - can you blame her? A **self-admitted** side project, famous for selling hats and [flamethrowers](https://www.instagram.com/p/BeeYW0NA1HU/), wants to use land underneath your city. And many of your constituents - the ones you represent - are vocally wary or even hostile to the idea. What would you do? How would you feel?

Sahli-Wells followed up with, ‚ÄúIt looks super sexy and super easy, but it‚Äôs half baked. It‚Äôs half baked from a public perspective.‚Äù

And, simply based on how Boring reps handled the presentation and ensuing Q & A, she wasn't wrong. The employees seemed underprepared to face anything resembling hostility. Which brings me back to my original two points:

**1.)** There's a vast difference between selling private goods and winning public trust

I doubt a Culver City Council meeting had ever been that packed. Nearly every seat was taken and there were two dozen people standing in the back of the room. And there were a LOT of Pro-Musk folks there (myself included). And it was enlightening to see how Musk loyalists would react to certain questions posed by the Council / public, and how ""regular"" people would react. I think it's a bit akin to watching all of the Harry Potter films AFTER you've already read the books. Your mind invisibly, subconsciously fills in a lot of gaps, to the point where you don't even recognize they exist.

But there's a vast difference between the relationship that exists between a private company and a prospective buyer, and a private company and the larger public. And it all boils down to: Consent. It's the important distinction between consciously buying a U2 album, vs [having it automatically installed on your phone](https://gigaom.com/2014/09/10/u2-on-my-phone). When you walk into a Tesla store, you make the conscious choice to enter. You're already signaling *some* level of interest to the company by simply walking through the door. That signaling then ratchets up and down based on your actions - are you engaging with an employee in the showroom? Are you asking questions? Or are you turning around and immediately walking out?

You'd be hard pressed to find a Tesla store chockfull of people who don't **actively** want to be there. If you do somehow encounter this scenario: Call the police, because we've got a hostage situation.

A public / private partnership is an entirely different beast. Instead of members of the public coming to *you* (The Company) and entering *your* space, you are pitching / begging / bribing / goading / forcing your way into *their* space. Suddenly, instead of a scenario in which 100% of the people you're interacting with agree to the interaction, you're fighting tooth and nail to claw your way to 50.1%. 

And The Boring Company representatives weren't equipped to do that.

Which brings me to -

**2.)** Any company will struggle to succeed when their CEO (by his own admission) dedicates ""2 or 3 percent"" of his time to it.

Elon has publicly said that, after he spends most of his time as the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, 2-3% of his time is spent on The Boring Company. And it showed that night. I‚Äôm incredibly sympathetic to the employees who were tasked with presenting the proposal to a not entirely supportive public, but they were in many ways underprepared. And who can blame them? When a boss is running one company intent on disrupting the automobile industry, and another on revolutionizing space travel, how much time every day does he spare the employees giving 100% of their time to his 3% side project? 

A CEO fully, 100% invested in Boring Company would have been felt in that presentation. Musk wasn‚Äôt.

What's so frustrating about all of this, is that the more I learn and understand about The Boring Company's proposals, the more I examine it from a [First Principles perspective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV3sBlRgzTI), the more excited I get about its mission. 

As someone who teared up as the Falcon Heavy Stage 1 boosters landed in-sync on their landing pads, who has been waiting since March 31, 2016 for a Model 3... 

I believe the best way for The Boring Company to succeed in its mission to revolutionize public transportation is for Musk to hand over the CEO reins to someone else.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7woloy/discussion_i_attended_the_boring_companys_culver/,FUTURESPEAKshow,4417.0,0.9863

TeslaMotors,frustrating,25tim3,My negative thoughts after 7k miles in including one long road trip.,"This is coming from someone who still drives ICE cars regularly, drives for a living and over 100k/yr, and is over 6' tall.

My other cars include a 2003 Jeep Wrangler built for off road use, a 2008 smart convertible, a 2011 Chevy Cruze, a 1985 Chevy short bus, and a 1969 project car that I'm not publicly discussing at the moment :)

Overall I love the car but I think it's important to talk about the downsides as well. Listed in no order:

¬∑Even at the lowest seat setting my head touches the roof unless I lean back further than I like

¬∑The app in its current form is pretty lame on both Android and ios

¬∑The range needs to double if I'm going to use it as my main car

¬∑What the hell was Tesla thinking building out the northern cross-country route for chargers before the southern one? The cold weather killed my range, putting me in the yellow zone between SD superchargers, and my car got stuck in the snow at the Cheyenne supercharger last week (video coming soon).

¬∑The software on the center dashboard is buggy. Luckily it can be updated but one time it was on a reset loop, overheated, and slightly warped the silver plastic bezel under the screen. When there's a problem things don't work like gps and Bluetooth, causing potential safety issues.

¬∑I wish it didn't have the panoramic roof.

¬∑It sucks knowing that in a short period of time the car will be significantly inferior to the next version. 

¬∑I'm tired of being an evangelist. You get a lot of questions with the car and I am tired of saying the same spiel over and over. I'm considering printing up a FAQ page to hand out. 

¬∑I wish batteries were leased instead of owned so that battery swapping would be more feasible and I wouldn't have longevity anxiety.

¬∑The software should be more sophisticated. It should give you your rated mileage based on current conditions, terrain variables along your route, and your speed preferences. As it is now it is oftentimes very inaccurate, especially in the cold and when hills/mountains are involved.

¬∑There should be a front facing camera and front/rear DVR with 'black box' capabilities.

¬∑The rear should be able to go completely flat.

¬∑Climate should be on a schedule

¬∑Cruise control should show what exactly it's set at and the 'jump' feature should settle on the 0/5 like on the Mercedes where Tesla gets its cruise system from. It should also be adaptive.

¬∑The latency in the Bluetooth is unacceptable and unfortunately I doubt it's a software problem. I've never had this issue with other cars and I've noticed it on every Model S. It also is unable to see what I'm playing, it just says the name of my phone. The standard KIA headunit on the rental car I currently have shows artist, song title, etc. The other annoyance with Bluetooth is that I have to manually select it every time I get in the car, it should remember what I was last on.

¬∑There should be a local contact person listed for problems at a supercharger that are out of Tesla's control. The hoops I had to jump through in Cheyenne were quite frustrating.

¬∑Open the SDK already!

¬∑The frunk is very annoying to close, especially with snow or rain.

That's all I can think of at the moment. As I said, I still love the MS but there is room for improvement.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/25tim3/my_negative_thoughts_after_7k_miles_in_including/,SethLevy,55087.0,-0.9773

I understand must of this things are minor and the service center has resolved and they give me a loaner every time and are super nice but I did not expect this from a Tesla

TeslaMotors,frustrating,f0rl05,Rant about Tesla‚Äôs infotainment & software priorities,"This is not about AP or FSD.

For reference, I drive a 2020 3LRD, but I‚Äôm sure this is relevant to S & X as well.

Some of the things I mention here are nit-picky, but some are legitimate ‚ÄúI paid enough for this car that this should be sorted‚Äù issues.

Start rant;

Does anyone else not give a hoot about having video games in their car? I‚Äôve literally played 
backgammon twice, and haven‚Äôt even opened any of the other games. And why add all these video 
streaming services when they haven‚Äôt even gotten the music streaming services right yet?

My frustration is that Tesla are putting too much emphasis on party-trick functions that I can't use while driving (even if FSD one day works, it‚Äôs at least a few years before we‚Äôll be able to watch TV or game while driving), instead of fixing/improving real features that I CAN use while driving. I have no problem with the party-tricks, but fix the real functions first. Owners are reporting all sorts of issues/complaints that seem to be getting ignored. A few examples off the top of my head;

- Spotify badly needs updating; sorting, 320kbps (for Spotify premium subscribers), podcasts, 
gapless playback / caching. Why pay for Tesla premium + Spotify premium only to lose 
features and quality? I can stream 4K YouTube, but not 320kbps music? WTF!? (in before 
you say to use Bluetooth from my phone. I am, but I shouldn‚Äôt have to)

- Auto-Wipers need a sensitivity setting NOT a neural net. Honestly, they work, but the
problem is that they‚Äôre currently not ‚Äúone-size fits all‚Äù. People have different preferences on 
how they want their wipers to work, and a neural net won‚Äôt change that. For me, I find the 
auto-wipers far too aggressive. They go full speed when I only want intermittent. Just give us a user adjustable sensitivity setting. The solution is so simple!

- Auto-dimming mirrors; Again, we need a sensitivity setting or a manual control.

- Climate control; I‚Äôve given up on auto-climate. It‚Äôs ok in mild weather, but doesn‚Äôt cope with 
the random weather where I live. It never cools my feet on a really hot day, and blows hot 
air in my face when it‚Äôs cold. Swap the F/R demisters and seat heaters off of the main screen and put the climate controls there instead. Or at the very least put manual fan speed on the 
main screen!

- Better yet, make the quick access bar at the bottom of the screen customizable. I‚Äôm not the 
first to suggest this. This will keep everyone happy.

- Even on manual mode the A/C temperature fluctuates. In this mode the temperature setting 
should control the vent temperature, but it seems to be going off the overall cabin temperature. So if the cabin temp is 23C and you set the A/C to 21C, it makes the air colder 
than 21C.

- Auto-high beams are an absolute joke. I can‚Äôt even.

I know there are lots of other features/fixes that people want too, but I can‚Äôt cover everything here. It sucks that only requests from famous tweeters get any traction, and I‚Äôm sure most of the things I've mentioned are relatively easy to change.

I just want Tesla to prioritise the useful stuff. 

Rant over.

Edit: a lot of good discussion here, which I appreciate. I think a lot of you missed my point, which is about Tesla‚Äôs priorities in this area, not necessarily the specific examples that I listed. My bad I guess for writing too much on them. And thanks to those that included tesla feedback email addresses.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,b78hrg,"Followup Post : Ramblings on owning a Model 3 for one week, after owning a Leaf for 3 years.","I'll start by saying that simply - this is the most amazing thing I have ever owned.

&#x200B;

Several people asked me to make a followup thread, as I assume there are a lot of people here who are actually Leaf/Bolt/i3 drivers that want to know how the model 3 (SR+) is different from what they're used to.

&#x200B;

For starters, the Leaf always felt like a go-kart.  It was super quick in the 0-30 range, which is what I spent most of my time doing around town, and it was just so zippy!  And because it was so zippy, I forgave the horrible audio system, the cheap plastic everythings, the fact that I couldn't charge my phone with the USB port in the car, the handling and tires, the fact that I couldn't supercharge more than once in a trip, and a few other things. For the **price**, it was, and still is a great car.  I loved the Leaf for what it was, and I really enjoyed driving it - until the day I sat down in my Tesla.

&#x200B;

Everything about this car screams quality, and I feel like I never knew what I was missing. I never knew a car could be this amazing!  It is the nicest car I have ever owned, by far.  Everything is smooth, the seats are beautiful, the screen is intuitive and functional, the backup camera is freaking top tier, the sound system leaves nothing to be desired, the handling is incredible, and the acceleration - holy crap.  I had never driven anything more than a 4 cylinder car (civic/accord type stuff) prior to driving my Leaf, so that felt *super quick*, but the Model 3, good lord.... it feels like I am driving the future - and this is after 3 years of owning *another* electric car!   The best way that I can sum up the feeling I have is that the Model 3 feels like a luxury car from the year 2100, *that just happens to be electric*, instead of the ""we'll sacrifice *literally everything else* to make it so you don't use gas"" that I drove for the last several years. 

&#x200B;

I was fortunate, in that my lease was set to expire 3 weeks after Elon announced the $35,000 Model 3. I was very close to going in, handing in my Leaf, and leasing a new 2018 (150 miles), or maybe holding out for the 2019 (225 miles), but I wasn't excited - **at. all.**  Once they announced the price of the new Leaf, I had already bought the Model 3 and was just waiting for it to arrive and I couldn't *fathom* the idea of spending almost the same amount for **so. much. less.**  I went and test drove a new 2019 Leaf, just to see if their price tag had its merits, and while they've made *improvements,* I was still frustrated by so many things - it still felt - as every other car I've driven from a car manufacturer that primarily makes ICE cars (bolt, clarity, i3, volt, kona), that they come at the electric car from the perspective of 100 years of automotive design centered around an engine, and all the things you ""need"" to make a car work - all the buttons, the ugly screens, the gauges, the feeling of ""features sacrificed to hit a price point"" - everything down to the sales pitch the guy was giving me at the dealership - that - *and I wish I was kidding here -* ""All new Nissans come with 4 free oil changes.  Is that something Tesla will do?""  I mean - their sales staff is straight **igggnant**, and we all know that, but man - come on.  It has no freaking engine.  It doesn't **use** oil.  I also don't need dealer markups, aggressive sales staff, and to spend 9 hours of my Saturday in a dealership wanting to chew my fingers off out of frustration and boredom.  I prefer the ten minutes I spent buying the car online and having it delivered.

&#x200B;

Overall, this sexy ass beast is more than I could have ever dreamed of in a car.  I've never had high expectations, because I am NOT a car guy - at all.  I learned the things I needed to in order to make my cars in the past operate (tire changes, oil change, check fluids, etc...) but I never wanted to invest $50,000 in a BMW because to me, it was the same as my civic, just a little faster, and... more douchey.  Expensive cars still had all the things I hated about cars in them - the maintenance, the bad screens, the 4,000 buttons and levers and vents and switches, the confusion of learning *their* ecosystem, and the fact that after 2 years the car needed work.  The only thing I did to my Leaf in 3 years was put a new tire on it because I ran over a nail, and fill it once with windshield wiper fluid - so I assume that my relationship with my Model 3 will be more like *that*, and less like my relationship with past ICE vehicles, and that makes me happy.  Overall, for the first time in my life I actually feel *lucky* that **I** get to drive a particular car.  Like - this thing is MINE, and it's from the future where unicorns and angels dream cars into existence, and it's magical, and I can't believe it's sitting in my garage right now.  I installed a *software update* to my **car** from 1,000 miles away that gave it **dog mode**.  Like WTF?  Explain that sentence to literally anyone outside of this subreddit [and they'd be like](https://i.imgur.com/Ed4LdEW.jpg)   I've made up like 9 excuses in the past week to go somewhere, just so I could drive it.  I have never done that.  Ever.  Above anything else I can say, that says the most.  I have never in my life cared about my car - other than my first 1985 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, because I actually owned ""a"" car.  A lot of time has passed in between then and now, and the fact that a car can make me feel like this - especially after having owned another electric car before - is truly amazing.

&#x200B;

I also spent $0.96 on supercharging, and sat for about an hour talking with two very nice Model S owners who helped me understand my car out of genuine enthusiasm for me owning it.  That was rad.

&#x200B;

I hope these dumb ramblings can help shed some light on the car for anyone who browses this subreddit and wonders if this car is for them.

I have had my Tesla Model 3 Performance since August 2018 (back when they were selling for \~$78K fully loaded). I brought my car in for service numerous times primarily for cosmetic issues but occasionally for rattles and noises. In the past they tried addressing the noises and were partially successful.  


Recently some of the rattling noises have become more pronounced and annoying. After making a service appointment I was told that noises are not covered under warranty and I would have to pay out of pocket to have them addressed. Tesla said any work done to fix noises in the past was a courtesy.  


I am shocked that a luxury car brand would act this way. I love my Tesla but am becoming increasingly frustrated with quality and customer service.

**First, please remember that this is a fan sub.** It was created by people who love Tesla's products and Tesla's vision. It should come as no surprise that the people here are enthusiastic about the brand and the company. I reviewed other car manufacturer subs to see how they balance things and I found more posts critical of Tesla in /r/Teslamotors than I found critical of BMW in /r/BMW or critical of Ford in /r/Ford. It wasn't even close. This has always been a sub by and for fans of Tesla. Why do people act surprised when the people on this sub tend to see the rainbow instead of the rain when Tesla news comes out? Participation here is optional and we all knew what kind of sub we were getting into when we subscribed.

**Second, the Anti-Evangelists.** There's a certain breed of subscriber that causes more havok for the mods than any other. These are very active users, and they *say* they want Tesla to succeed, but if you read the content of their posts you'll find that they don't actually have *anything* good to say about anyone or anything.  If you are in hour 9 of a 12-hour ""Here's why Tesla sucks"" marathon, please remember to keep it civil. I'm not here to censor you, but insults and name-calling have no place here. You might think that you're enlightening the benighted with your wisdom, but you're coming off as the bad guy who's just here to be nasty about something someone else cares about. If you really need to get this out of your system, I recommend finding an NFL subreddit and telling people why their favorite team sucks.

**Third, I have to enforce the rules.**  I don't want to delete your posts or your comments. It wastes my time and it annoys you. Nobody wins when I have to click Delete. When the sub was smaller, it was easy to maintain some order, but times have changed. I won't recount the rules here, but here are a few tips that will help you keep your posts from being removed for rule violations:

* If your post is essentially ""I saw a Tesla!"" or ""Here's a picture of a Tesla!"" please post it in the Daily Discussion thread, in /r/TeslaLounge or /r/TeslaPorn. There are so many Tesla vehicles on the road today that we get hundreds of Tesla sightings posted and they drown out legitimate discussion. One exception to this rule is Roadsters, which are always welcome. The other exception is for truly unique, amazing photos, because the mods are fans, too. Maybe in the future when there isn't so much Tesla news flying around we can be more liberal with these kinds of posts, but for now, the rule stands.
* If your post is essentially ""I just got my Tesla!"", congratulations! If you want to talk about your delivery experience, build quality, or what you think of the vehicle, please post it in the Daily Discussion thread or in /r/TeslaLounge. You are welcome to express your opinion and share your experiences good or bad, however, with Tesla delivering so many cars every day, we can no longer give a separate thread to every delivery.  This is another one we might be able to be more liberal about in the future when there's less news in the wild and things have calmed down.
* If your post is essentially ""I went to a Supercharger!"" and you want to post a photo of it, please post it in /r/TeslaLounge, /r/Superchargers or /r/TeslaPorn. With over 10,000 supercharger plugs available worldwide, we simply can't have a separate thread posted for each one. We would make an exception for brand new supercharger locations if you make a nice post out of it telling us what's nearby and where it's located instead of just posting a photo. We know what supercharger stalls look like.
* If your post is essentially ""I went on a road trip"" please post that to the Daily Discussion Megathread or /r/TeslaLounge. With vehicles in the hundreds of thousands and billions of autopilot miles driven, we can no longer host a separate thread for each road trip one of our subscribers makes, no matter how awesome it was.
* If your post is essentially ""I'm not sure what to order"", ""I have questions about delivery"", ""I have a question about tax credits"", ""I have a question about financing"" or anything at all about a VIN, please post it in the Question and Answer Megathread, but be sure to use the search function, first. There are very few questions that have not already been answered exhaustively.
* If your post is essentially ""My car is broken"", please contact Tesla. We'd like to help, but we can't. If you're looking for more information about a particular problem, ask questions that we can answer, otherwise the first reply to your post will be, ""Have you contacted Tesla?"" Technically, these should also go to the discussion megathreads.

**Fourth, Dismissive Language.** These are labels the people apply to arguments so they can dismiss the argument out of hand instead of addressing it on its merits. Among these are FUD, Short, Fanboi, Cult and others. While using this kind of language isn't expressly forbidden, it's often used rudely and aggressively to silence someone instead of engaging them in a meaningful discussion. People often use it to suppress debate. If someone is spreading lies, prove them wrong. Replying with ""Nice FUD, Short!"" or ""Here comes the fanboi circlejerk"" proves nothing except your inability to form a counter-argument.

**Finally, let me remind you that I'm a human, too.** I have good days and bad days, and I definitely get busy, distracted or frustrated. I like it here. I've met some really interesting people through this sub. Some of you I'd even call friends. Tesla says that they are on a mission to accelerate sustainable transportation to help make the world a better, less-polluted place. While we can't necessarily do that for planet Earth all by ourselves, we can at least make this subreddit a better, less-polluted place.

I look forward to working with all of you.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,8s8512,I was a phone key fan but now I don't trust it and have stopped using it.,"It worked really well the first week or so, not a single issue and then...it started. 

Coming out of the store, it's raining, hands full of groceries with my three year old and no response from the car. Of course there are people watching because I park away from everyone so there nice shiny car is in the middle of the lot with some idiot trying to get in. Tried to restart bluetooth, nothing. Airplane mode, nothing. Finally I reached for my wallet to find my card which worked. 

Next time was at home trying to unlock to show it to some friends that came over. Another fail, had to get the keycard out. 

Happened twice yesterday at work and once while picking my daughter at school. I've owned the car for 8 days and the last four days have been horrible. I have an iPhone 8, most recent non beta version and I've shut off auto lock as I don't want to risk it not unlocking. I guess I'll manually lock and just use the card for now, not ideal but I know it will work. So frustrating because I love the idea of only using my phone but it's probably around an 80% success rate which is embarrassing.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,ax50sn,"[Discussion] ProTip: If you were unhappy with Navigate on Autopilot when you first tried it, turn off Mad Max and try it again."," 

In many threads I keep seeing folks confused as to how people like myself enjoy Navigate on Autopilot (NoA) at all. I think a large part of people's frustration with NoA is due to when it was launched everyone set the lane change option to Mad Max because of the cool name and misunderstanding of what the setting actually does. But leaving NoA set to Mad Max will annoy you.¬†  
The  lane change setting will adjust how slow the person in front of you  must be in order for NoA to suggest a lane change. On ""mild"" NoA set to  \~70mph will just have you chill behind the guy in front of you that is  going 60mph. On ""average"" it will suggest overtaking when the guy in  front of you is around 65mph. (Just guestimates of speeds for examples). In ""mad max""mode it will basically not  tolerate anyone going slower than your set speed. This leads to useless  and frequent lane changes.   
Mad  Max DOES NOT change how aggressive the car is in making the actual lane  change maneuver. It will still bake to wait for a wide gap in traffic  and gingerly shuffle over to the next lane. I know that when Elon first  mentioned Mad Max it was in regards to being aggressive in lane change  maneuvers but that is not what we got in production. Read the  description in the UI.  
I  still find many of the maneuvers that NoA makes annoying. It decelerates  too aggressively when changing lanes if there is someone in your blind  spot. It basically never accelerates to make a lane change as I would  naturally want to do about half the time. It decelerates too  aggressively at exits and brake checks the car behind you. Once you  predict some of these things you can avoid them and NoA is quite useful  on longer trips to pass slower traffic without thinking much about it  and in the city to help get you in the correct lane for a highway  interchanges.¬†¬†  
Tldr:  turn off Mad Max. It does not do what many of you still seem to think it does. You may have a slightly happier time with NoA.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ax50sn/discussion_protip_if_you_were_unhappy_with/,claribanter,1370.0,-0.9878
TeslaMotors,frustrating,45q2d3,I was forced to visit the infamous San Juan Capistrano Supercharger (warning: rant),"I was driving round trip today from San Diego to LA and back, and was routed to the SJC Supercharger. When I arrived, every stall was taken, and every car but one was vacant. I pulled into a spot to wait (fortunately I was the first one waiting, so I assumed I'd get the first open spot). Another Tesla parked to wait soon after me, and the driver and I started chatting.

I told him that I only needed 10 to 15 minutes on the SC to get enough charge to get home with a comfortable margin of error, which seemed to surprise him a little. I told him that I have only used SCs a handful of times, and only on long trips. He admitted that he lived a few miles away, and was basically coming to fill up his battery for free. He also said that most of the people that come to that SC seem to be locals.

I told him that Tesla needs to do something to limit that behavior, to which he had no answer. Here I am, stuck waiting for a quick top off, on a legitimate road trip, while a bunch of cheap local drivers are just there for free electricity. Maybe I'm missing something, but if you can afford to drive a Tesla, you should be able to pay for the electricity to keep it charged for daily driving. Even in California, the cost of electricity to charge your car at home is cheaper than what you'd spend on gas for a comparable ICE.

Someone finally showed up and moved their car about 40 minutes after I first arrived. As I pulled into the spot, someone who arrived much later, tried to take it first...another example of despicable Tesla owner behavior! I plugged in for exactly 12 minutes, got the charge I needed, and left.

Tesla really needs to consider some sort of GPS-enabled software solution. Maybe your charger port doesn't open at your local SC if more than half of the stalls are full, unless you are below a critical range. Maybe your charger port doesn't open at your local SC more than a few times a month. As more Teslas hit the roads, this problem is only going to get worse without some way to limit local drivers abusing a vital infrastructure that was meant to facilitate long distance driving.

Waiting 40 minutes for a spot to charge and having to fend off someone who tried to jump my spot in the queue, made for a pretty shitty SC experience (pardon my language, but that's what it was...shitty). It took me almost an hour to get the equivalent mileage of 2-3 gallons of gas. I love my Model S more than any car I've ever owned, but for that very frustrating hour, I wish I could have just pulled into the gas station across the street and been on my way in again in under 5 minutes.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,hf1z6b,"Not many chargers near me. In your opinion, is this a big deal when buying a Tesla?","Title- Wife and I are considering buying a model 3 sometime in the near future.

Now obviously the primary charging station would be our home, but should the lack of chargers deter us at all? I guess I‚Äôm a little frustrated that there are so few. Several of them are part of hotels and for guests only, so that makes charging while ‚Äòout and about‚Äô even more difficult. 

We do live ‚Äúnear‚Äù (30 min) a big city that has one supercharger and a few other chargers around, but honestly the city is super out of the way and I don‚Äôt see myself ever charging there unless I happen to be in the area.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,dbk05o,[Suggestion] Tesla's navigation should better estimate how HVAC (heat) impacts range,"It's starting to get cold again and I'm thinking about the inconveniences of cold climate driving (having initially gotten my model 3 just over a year ago). The only time I felt any range anxiety was during road trips last winter. I wish Tesla's navigation would better estimate how HVAC use impacts the range. Specifically the heat, the AC doesn't seem to hurt the range nearly as badly.

It's frustrating and stressful to be driving any reasonably long distance and have the navigation initially estimate you'll reach your destination with like 23% battery remaining and after an hour of driving it's dropped all the way to 6%. You have no idea how much further it's going to keep dropping and it can significantly change your travel plans.

Tesla must have some idea how (in)efficient the heater is. They could just calculate the effect based on the current exterior temperature and interior climate control setting. This would alleviate any range anxiety, and could allow for better planning of charging stops and range.

I know a workaround is to turn off the HVAC and turn on the seat heaters. Yeah, that sort of works for me personally, but it can still get very cold and it's hard to force upon other people. I can't imagine my buddy telling his wife and young daughter that. (Side note: Bonus points for tesla if they would update the range live between HVAC on and off so you could make a decision if it was worth it to deal with the cold, just using the seat heater.)

Anyway, thoughts?

**tl;dr:** Tesla's navigation should better estimate how HVAC impacts range using the exterior temperature and interior climate control settings. Cold climate range anxiety is real, this would significantly help alleviate it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/dbk05o/suggestion_teslas_navigation_should_better/,EvanVanVan,5719.0,0.9272
TeslaMotors,frustrating,6bfhar,Finished my first road trip in my Model S. Here are some thoughts and experiences.,"I just finished my first long-distance road trip in my Tesla, and I figured I would share my thoughts, experiences, and observations. This might be useful to owners who haven't had the opportunity to take a road trip (yet) or who haven't collected as much data as I have. It might also be useful to enthusiasts and potential future owners.

My trip took me from my home in Tampa, FL (with one passenger) up to Mountain City, GA to pick up two more passengers, and finally to my destination in Boone, NC. On the return trip, I went straight from Boone to Tampa. Both directions of the trip were broken into two days of driving. I stopped in Roswell (just north of Atlanta) on the way to Mountain City at a hotel which featured a Tesla destination charger. I couldn't find any reasonably-priced hotels with destination chargers for the return trip, so I instead opted to stay at a (much) cheaper hotel very near the Savannah, GA supercharger and to instead go and supercharge once everyone was checked into their rooms.

My car is a 2016 Model S with free supercharging and autopilot 2.0 hardware. My supercharging stops were:

- Lake City, FL
- Tifton, GA
- Macon, GA
- *(destination charging overnight)*
- Asheville, NC
- *(charging at final destination on 120V AC)*
- Columbia, NC
- Savannah, GA
- Kingsland, GA
- Ocala, FL

I set up a personal server to collect all possible data from the car (via the undocumented owners API) at the following intervals:

- Every minute when driving or supercharging
- Every 5 minutes when charging on AC
- Every 30 minutes when parked unplugged or charging complete

# Charging

I initially thought that with the lack of refueling stops and rest area stops that time added to the trip by charging would be roughly equivalent to time saved. I was wrong about this. My family traditionally packs sandwich lunches and eats them in the parking lot of rest areas so that we can get back on the road as quickly as possible. While the supercharging stops were not an unwelcome change of pace, they did add noticeable time to the trip.

I also initially thought that all superchargers are crazy fast and provide a large amount of relatively constant power. This was also incorrect. My average charging energy for each stop was:

- Lake City: 65 kW (29% to 73% SOC, 32 minutes)
- Tifton: 69 kW (23% to 76%, 36 minutes)
- Macon: 48 kW (32% to 62%, 30 minutes)
- Asheville: 32 kW (21% to 41%, 30 minutes)
- Asheville: 78 kW (41% to 50%, 5 minutes)
- Asheville: 43 kW (51% to 86%, 36 minutes)
- Columbia: 50 kW (21% to 88%, 61 minutes)
- Savannah: 68 kW (15% to 85%, 47 minutes)
- Kingsland: 62 kW (37% to 89%, 38 minutes)
- Ocala: 51 kW (31% to 94%, 56 minutes)

Asheville is listed 3 times because I did some experimentation there. After everyone got out of the car, I turned on the A/C with the mobile app in order to keep the car cool and to avoid snacks from melting. At this point, the car was charging at a relatively high rate (around 90 kW) Once everyone got food, I noticed on the app that the car was charging extremely slowly. I went out and moved it to a different supercharger stall, where the same thing happened: it initially charged very quickly and then dropped down. I stopped and restarted charging from the app and this time kept A/C off.

I have made a graph of the Savannah supercharging session [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/6b843t/i_will_be_concluding_my_first_longdistance_road/). I've also made a graph of the Ocala supercharging session [here](https://mckay.media/MU29i.png).

I charged around 332.07 kWh at superchargers during this trip. If I didn't have free supercharging, this would have eaten a considerable portion of my free annual supercharging credits (400 kWh).

The built-in trip planner seems to aim for a 15% buffer at your destination. I typically stayed at the supercharger for around as long as it said I needed to, then it estimated 15% remaining charge at the next supercharger. That estimated charge went up as I drove (maybe I drove more conservatively than it expected).

In terms of destination charging, I've found that it seems to be better to look for hotels near superchargers than for hotels which have destination chargers. For one, those hotels that have destination chargers tend to be much more expensive (at least in this area). I was also fortunate enough to not have to compete with another Tesla owner for the charger; it could have been very frustrating if that were the case. Several of the superchargers I stopped at were located near hotels (the Columbia charger is literally in the parking lot of a Hilton). Stopping near a supercharger also has the added benefit of giving you a car. When I pulled into the hotel on the way to Mountain City, I noticed that the Tesla charger was open so I snagged it as quickly as possible. I was then left at the mercy of the hotel shuttle to get around, since I didn't want to give up the charger and risk losing it.

# Driving

Autopilot handled like a dream. Maybe a dozen or so times in the entire 1,556 mile trip did I have to manually take over, and that was usually around construction zones where the lines on the road were all over the place, or when someone started to drift into my lane. I'm very, very impressed with how well the Autopilot 2.0 system handled on the 17.17.4 software.

The car's estimates for battery range were very accurate. I found that using TACC to maintain around 75 mph on the (flat) interstate hovered around the ideal 300 Wh/mile. I had the A/C set to between 67-69 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the trip. Here are the discrepancies between the car's rated range (the range displayed on the instrument cluster) and the actual distance traveled, as checked at each charging station:

	Lake City Supercharger
		Charging duration: 32 minutes
		Consumed range: 184.65
		Distance traveled: 170.59
		Lost miles: 14.06

	Tifton Supercharger
		Charging duration: 36 minutes
		Consumed range: 130.48
		Distance traveled: 106.59
		Lost miles: 23.89

	Macon Supercharger
		Charging duration: 30 minutes
		Consumed range: 117.21
		Distance traveled: 103.81
		Lost miles: 13.4

	DoubleTree Roswell
		Charging duration: 506 minutes
		Consumed range: 116.47
		Distance traveled: 109.58
		Lost miles: 6.89

	Asheville
		Charging duration: 30 minutes
		Consumed range: 206.68
		Distance traveled: 196.4
		Lost miles: 10.28

	Boone House
		Charging duration: 2114 minutes
		Consumed range: 122
		Distance traveled: 109.21
		Lost miles: 12.79

	Columbia Supercharger
		Charging duration: 61 minutes
		Consumed range: 172.53
		Distance traveled: 186.41
		Lost miles: -13.88

	Savannah Supercharger
		Charging duration: 47 minutes
		Consumed range: 187.27
		Distance traveled: 170.75
		Lost miles: 16.52

	Kingsland Supercharger
		Charging duration: 38 minutes
		Consumed range: 124.24
		Distance traveled: 105.31
		Lost miles: 18.93

	Ocala Supercharger
		Charging duration: 56 minutes
		Consumed range: 148.56
		Distance traveled: 139.82
		Lost miles: 8.74

The Columbia supercharger has negative loss because there was a lot of downhill driving from the Boone house to the supercharger. It's curious that there wasn't more loss from Asheville to the Boone house, in my opinion.

One small gripe: the GPS-based speed limit detection worked relatively poorly on the mountain roads and sometimes on US highways (e.g. US-301). By that, I mean that it just didn't detect speed limit changes somewhat frequently.

# Socialization

The superchargers usually weren't very full (I believe 2 other Teslas in addition to my own was the record). When there were Teslas charging, either they were empty or the occupants had sealed themselves inside and didn't seem to be in a talkative mood. I noticed that these folks usually appeared to be somewhat elderly. The only Tesla owner I was able to converse with was a Model X owner at the Columbia supercharger, who informed me that he lived in the area and was only at the supercharger for free power. He let me take a look around since I'd never seen a Model X up close before, and demonstrated modelxmas.

I think it might be neat if there were a Tesla social network, in which you fill in a brief profile detailing some basic information about you, your interests, etc. Then, when you start supercharging, it could show you information about others who have filled out profiles who are also charging at your station. This might help to break the ice a little bit. Just a silly little idea. :)

I also didn't see *any* Teslas on the trip that weren't at a supercharger or a standard charging station, besides one that was being hauled on a car-carrier truck along with vehicles from other makes.

# Supercharger Amenities

Most of the superchargers had decent amenities, albeit some required a bit of a walk (e.g. Columbia's closest food was a short hike away). The Macon supercharger seemed to be in a not-great area of town, and since I arrived past 5 PM, the nearby African-American museum and welcome center were both closed. The Ocala supercharger is located in the parking lot of a half-completed shopping complex, and the closest food that wasn't a sit-down restaurant was about a 10-minute walk through the shopping complex. The Asheville supercharger was in the parking lot of an outlet mall, which I liked (there need to be more of those).

>Sad and frustrating public service announcement to fellow Tesla owners: My Tesla Model S was stolen last night. It was in the garage at my boyfriend‚Äôs condo. It looks like the thieves were able to hack another Tesla key and start my car. I know this because this morning when I discovered it missing, I found the leather key holder of that key in the parking space. I have my phone and key with me so that‚Äôs not an issue. I immediately logged onto the app, but it said ‚ÄúMobile Access disabled‚Äù, so I called Tesla right away. They said they could give me no information until I had a police report number. So after 30 minutes with the police, I called Tesla with a case number / detective name and was able to learn that my car‚Äôs doors were opened at 3:15am and it was driven at 3:45am. Other than that, the service person was very sympathetic, but absolutely no help. The car has had the connection services completely shut down. When I try to go in the app now, it gives ‚ÄúVehicle Connection Error‚Äù. No one at Tesla is able to help me and they can‚Äôt override this.

>Lesson learned so far: Tesla keys can be hacked to start another car. Tesla support is practically worthless when your car is stolen. If the thieves disable the mobile device services, there is no way to know where your car is. There is no way for Tesla to disable a stolen car that has been powered down to keep it from being powered up again. If you find out on a Saturday morning that your car is stolen, you are completely screwed because the people that work the weekends do not have much technical knowledge. They have mentioned several times that the more technical support people work Mon-Friday. I complained to Tesla customer support that if I had LoJack, the support would be 100% there for me, and they‚Äôd on the case immediately. With Tesla, all she said was ‚Äúkeep your eye on the app and if you see it go back on, put the car in Valet Mode‚Äù. However, the app has been disabled so that advice is completely worthless. I asked why there wasn‚Äôt a way that either Tesla or I could be notified if the car gets powered up or goes back online, and she replied ‚Äúthat would be a good idea but we don‚Äôt currently have that ability‚Äù. Oh, and if this happens to you, be sure that when you call Tesla you have the following information: Case #, detective name and their badge number. They won‚Äôt give you ANY information without those three pieces of information. I am dismayed that Tesla does not have technically knowledgeable supervisors 24/7 for cases such as this.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,x3tnx8,10x Off grid Powerwall Blackout / Power Issues Update,"Hey All,

It has now been 12 months since we posted our issue and it's well overdue for an update.When we first reported this issue on the forums, Tesla had been working on the situation for a number of weeks without resolution and I thought I'd share my situation given it was impacting both our business and home lives (father of 3 kids)(Original post [https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/pgf7n4/powerwall\_failures\_what\_would\_you\_do\_if\_you\_were/](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/pgf7n4/powerwall_failures_what_would_you_do_if_you_were/))  
Short video of the install today   
[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/CTRhymphRx4](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/CTRhymphRx4)

We experienced anywhere from 0->50 blackouts a day in the early days of the installation and very dirty power with flickering lights, spiking voltages, pool pumps braking during the frequent on/off cycles.

The issue as identified and advised by the Tesla specialists is that our 10 Powerwall system was reaching max capacity across CPU, RAM and CANBus bandwidth, essentially the Tesla Gateway module is being overloaded trying to manage all 10 Powerwall's at the same time, whilst this situation results in micro outages, most people wouldn't notice these outages if they're grid connected as the grid is essentially always there as a backup to your batteries (strange thought). In my instance, if the batteries lose sync, drop for seconds, minutes, it's very noticeable, a silent, eerry, blackout.

We have now tried 3-4 firmware changes and have been advised for the last 12 months or so that we can only have 7 powerwalls online, we turned off 3 and everything worked fine; however, we've had numerous blackouts during the ""attempted fix"" cycles, whereby patch is applied ,turn all powerwalls back on, then randomly weekly later power outages resume etc.

One other alternative that didn't suit our business case was to turn off wifi and the ability to connect to it on the local network to see statistics or access the API (which meant the system would no longer integrate with our Home Automation system (Home assistant) i.e. when power lower than 20% force Air Cons to be turned off was no longer possible via our prior configuration through LAN protocols

It's been a stressful situation for the family as the wife & kids don't handle the uncertainty of power all that well, or at least, not acclimatised to unreliable power situations, we've had well and truly over 300 outages this past year, numerous corrupted pc's due to hard drives spinning during power outages, numerous business interruption's.

We ""feel"" like we're guinea pigs for Tesla, I'm definitely at the point of frustration and have insisted numerous times that I want to simply be refunded a portion of the install/damages, turn off X powerwalls and move on with our lives as there is no end in sight, unfortunately it's been a number of months since we reached that point and expressed that level of interest in leaving this test process; however, we're still yet to be put in contact with the right team to handle a customer resolution/exit process.

I also don't know how much of our business / family damages will ever be refunded etc, it's very unsettling now becoming a very negative experience despite the high level of support in the first 6 months, the fact we started this install in June 2021 and it's still an issue in September 2022 is a challenge to mentally deal with.

Sorry for the whinge all, just feeling lost in this situation and lost confidence in the longevity of our install

Yours truly, the tired Tesla enthusiast

TeslaMotors,frustrating,ahygq1,[Discussion] Winter experience with Model 3 (not driving),"I‚Äôm in Toronto and in the past 36 hours, we‚Äôve been slammed by one heck of a winter storm.  Temps were around -15c (5f) yesterday with tons of snow and while the precipitation has stopped, the mercury is dropping further to -23c (-9f) later today.  In other words, real winter.  I also don‚Äôt have a garage so my Tesla is parked in the elements.

I‚Äôm curious to hear about tips and tricks people have around operating the car in these conditions.  Not driving per se, the Model 3 snow handling capabilities are well documented and driving around yesterday, I felt like I was in a high performance tank!  But the rest of the experience left me a bit frustrated.  Specifically:

- the wipers!!  Yesterday‚Äôs snow fell wet and froze upon landing.  That was fine for the glass surfaces but wipers receded into this little well (for aerodynamic reasons) that became a solid chunk of ice.  As there is no heat there, there was no way to prevent this from happening.   Whenever I stopped for an errand, I‚Äôd put the wipers on service mode so they would sit on the glass and thaw a bit but the results were really mixed.

- heaters!!  Sure the electric heaters are awesome but controlling the vents and air flow is super frustrating.  I feel like I need a neuralink helmet or something because the car tries to be smart and really, it doesn‚Äôt know squat about cold winter management.  I wish there was a way to put the system in true manual mode.  For example, the car kept kicking off the front defroster when all I wanted to do was keep a constant flow of hot air on the windshield.  This compounded the wiper issue.

-  app control!  It‚Äôs been commented on in these forums before but Tesla really needs to give us direct front and rear defroster control in the app.  Whatever algorithm they use to decide to turn it on is not good.  Having this control would have been a life saver yesterday!

I will add that I had to power port issues which is good.  I‚Äôm on 2018.50.5.  Also, while scraping off the car this morning (it was under a foot of snow) I knew to run a credit car along the window edge where it meets the door.  As a result, doors opened perfectly.   Cleaning out the windshield went pretty well too though had to open frunk to clean out the wiper well.

So that‚Äôs my first major winter storm experience.  Welcome the feedback and tips/tricks.

All the best!

TeslaMotors,frustrating,il8wxj,Model 3 Dual Motor - Frequent Tire Replacement,"I love my Tesla, but as time passes I keep finding more and more reasons why it's expensive to own. While my car has had zero mechanical issues in the first two years, I've run into a few small issues:

1. Tires are apparently worn out at 23K miles. These 19"" tires are $1400 or so after tax to replace. Used to run be under $700 to have SUV tires replaced (and they lasted 30-40K on very heavy SUVs like the Pilot or MDX). So in that sense, I am paying double for tires and getting half the mileage. This will add up.
2. Stinky AC issue. While I understand this is a common design flaw across many (or all?) Teslas, it's odd that Tesla is making the customers pay for this. Mine is in the shop today being serviced to remove the foot odor AC smell when the AC first comes on.
3. Charging and mileage. Found out my first winter that the rated mileage for the long range dual motor was not was it was advertised to be, especially in cold weather. I think we now all understand the mechanics of the issue, but it does mean I am paying more for powering the car than expected. In addition, the electric rates in my home state (CT) are very high, and gas is not as much more as expected. 

In the end, still really like the car. The tires are a little bit frustrating, since I just got whacked unexpectedly for 1400 (was expecting to not have to worry about tires for at least another year).",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/il8wxj/model_3_dual_motor_frequent_tire_replacement/,OldBackstop,1015.0,0.003

TeslaMotors,frustrating,98hj6z,AWD delivered!,"A few days ago I posted a call to arms to future AWD owners. I was frustrated at the lack of videos. Sure, we've seen our share of the Performance ""Holy Sh\*t!"" videos but where were ours? Well, I finally go my AWD on Wednesday and I think I've solved that riddle:

I've been having a blast! The last few days going on unneeded trips, giving rides to friends and trying every feature I can get my hands on. I still peek out the window every morning to confirm that it's really there. Yes, I had a bunch of minor issues to fix that are on a due bill and I haven't yet heard back from Tesla, when they were supposed to reach out immediately. Am I worried about that right now? No. I'm out driving. The car is amazing to drive regardless if the headlights have a bit of overbite, the charge port makes an odd noise and the panel gaps aren't perfect (I'm in the 68xxx batch if you're interested).

But I realized something on my way home and it answered the question I raised in that post. Yes, this car is fast. Fast enough to get a legit ""Holy Sh\*t"" from a friend who I just took for a ride earlier today. And that was going up an incline... When I first drove it off the lot and got on the freeway it was dizzyingly fast. My first thought echoed that of another post: ""That'll do."" Literally dizzying speed and I've saved $10k+ for Supercharging fees, upgrades and add-ons down the road. So what about the video postings? Well, I think non-Performance AWD owners fall into a different category. We don't have bragging rights to the top 0-60s so you aren't going to see those kinds of videos from us. But that doesn't mean this car isn't fast. It is. It's just not the fastest. What it does mean is that we are probably out enjoying the h@ll out of it. It is so well balanced, so tight. Someone said it's like flying and I agree. But it's more: Because of the one-pedal driving and the sporty roll-less handling, it feels like it is powered by thought.

So stay strong future AWD owners and hold the line. Our day is ~~coming~~ here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/98hj6z/awd_delivered/,yeahgoestheusername,48429.0,0.9958
TeslaMotors,frustrating,92v0p6,"Horrible delivery experience at Rockville, MD service center. Model 3 delivery delayed 5 times. Over a month later and still no car....","Some background, we are day 1 reservation holders (online) and live in Maryland. We finally got our order config email on April 13, 2018 and contacted by our ISA by email on June 1. A few days go by, and we have our delivery date! June 22nd out of Rockville. We are very excited, but soon things here take a turn.

A day before delivery, we get a call from our ISA saying the car did not meet their ""technical quality"" and our car will have to be delayed until the 27th. OK, not that big a deal, it's only 5 days. 4 days go by and again, the day before delivery, we get a call saying our car is not ready for delivery will not be ready until sometime in the first week of July. Ok...not that weird since I assumed Tesla was trying to meet their <200k delivered before July deadline, but still frustrating since this would've been the 2nd delay with very little explanation.

July 2nd rolls around and we get an email from a *different* ISA, now saying our delivery appointment will be on July 19, far past the ""first week"" of July. I'm fuming at this point. By now, the delivery date is practically a month later than the original with no explanation of what's happening with our car. So two days before out delivery, I went to the delivery center to confirm that our date is still good for the 19th, and the sales specialist I spoke to said yes, we're still on track.

July 18th rolls around and at this point, I'm mentally preparing myself for a phone call, and low and behold we got one. Delayed, no explanation of why, just ""not ready for delivery"" and no future estimation. I decided I've had enough and drove the delivery center and demanded some answers. Eventually I talked to a ""delivery manager"" who fed me some BS, but did find out the car is in Atlanta, GA at the service center. I asked why it's been taking so long to get the car here, and he said he could not tell me why, as that'd be too logistically difficult to track the car's every movement (I thought this was bullshit, but whatever). 

He went to the back and returned 15 min later saying ""it's safe to schedule you for July 25th."" I am hesitant to believe anything Tesla says, but I agree and set up a delivery appointment. He gave me his phone number and told me to text him 5 days before delivery so he can check to see if the car is on track. I do, and he replied ""It's on track."" So far so good.

We roll up July 25th to the service center, and by now the people who work there know who I am, and I'm greeted with ""Is your car here now?"", and ""Welcome back!"" half jokingly. We sit around for 10-15min and another person comes out apologizing that our car isn't here yet. I'm livid now. I ask where it is, he says ""Atlanta."" Ok now what the actual fuck?

 I explained all of this to him, and he apologizes saying he doesn't know why the other guy told me that, and that he himself would be taking over responsibility for our car. The new guy showed us emails of them trying to figure out why the car isn't here yet, with no luck other than vague and weird explanations like ""the car is still in pieces at the service center"" (paraphrasing). I asked him about this, and he speculates it's the people at the service center trying to cover their asses for dropping the ball, but I guess we'll never know. He did, however, manage to get us in a loaner Model S 100D until our car got here.

He gave us his contact info and said he'll contact us every day with the status and location of our car. He did for the next day, saying the car ""missed the truck"" but, he'll try and escalate it early in the morning. We haven't heard anything from him since then.

Overall, it's been a very disappointing experience. I'm only willing to put up with this because I am a die hard Tesla fan, and really agree wit their mission, but this is actually absurd. Has anything like this happened to anyone else?

EDIT: Contrary to the exaggeratory title, I am not blaming the people at the service center. It is clear that there are issues/hold ups at other locations that they were not made aware of. Telsa and their Inside Sales team, however, definitely needs to step it up in terms of transparency and communication.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,cieo0z,Dog mode legalities?,"   Today was my first day using dog mode on my model 3 with my pup in the back seat and both times i had a run in with somebody. At the supermarket a man came sprinting up to me to tell me that i forgot to leave my windows down and when I informed him that the ac was on and that the dog was fine he didn‚Äôt seem to believe me. Then a while later i stopped by Canadian Tire and was inside for only ten minutes but by the time I came out a guy was by my car waiting and told me that he had called the fire department and shortly after a fire engine pulled up. I let the guy know the AC was on and the temperature was on the display and he replied with ‚Äúya i know but i was just making sure‚Äù which kind of pissed me off because then he just wasted the time of the fire department just cus?....

   Now here comes my question. The two firemen were totally understanding today and just went on their way but say the authorities were called and they weren‚Äôt understanding could I get in trouble at all for leaving my dog in the car even with dog mode on? 

   And if someone went ahead and decided to break one of my windows would they be liable?

TeslaMotors,frustrating,f2w6k0,The WORST Tesla mobile experience I've had.,"I realized a couple weeks ago that my glovebox light wouldn't come on when the glovebox was opened. I had just watched a YouTube video on how someone had the same issue and the mobile service couldn't fix it because it was a harnessing issue (it had to be taken to the shop instead), but I decided to give mobile service a shot anyways. I made my appointment, was sent a text the next day for an earlier appointment, so I took it.

The service tech arrived and began working on the glovebox. He took apart the entire thing and all the surrounding trim pieces. He then put the whole thing back and realized it was all hooked up correctly and that it must have been a harnessing issue. So he told me to make another service appointment to actually take the car in. But before he left, I realized the glovebox was completely misaligned. The bottom left of the glovebox door was not aligned properly it looked completely out of place. I have examined my car thoroughly many times and always keep an eye out for what looks out of place, so I know what my glovebox looked like before he started. Mind you, it was like 6 pm at this time and he was working with a small light. So I brought it to his attention and at first he looked at it with a pause, ran his hand across it, and said ""this is normal. I service 100s of cars a month and I would consider this normal."" I told him that I believed him, but that I know what my glovebox looked like before and that there was no way it looked like that. He kept pushing that it was normal, so I dug in to my camera roll and found a picture of the dash wrap I had installed where my glovebox was in the picture. He looked at it and said ok I can open it and put it back together again.

So he took apart the whole glovebox again. I was sitting in the driver seat at this point but on my phone. I noticed he was extremely aggressive with all the pieces. He went on to explain that it couldn't have been installed incorrectly, because the pins that hold it up wouldn't have gone in correctly. He put the whole thing back and said ""that's the best I can get it. I can make a note that you weren't happy with the re-install and the service center can see if they can fix it for you."" But he kept saying that's the best I can do. He even said ""I don't even know what to touch to fix what you're asking me to fix even if I thought it needed fixing."" All-in-all he was super dismissive, and I hadn't even gotten my original problem fixed!

The next morning I went to look at the glovebox in daylight and found a list of issues that really pissed me off.

1. The glovebox door was filthy. Scuffs and smudges all over.
2. The trim piece on the bottom was literally bent and out of place.
3. The glovebox didn't open all the way/properly.
4. There was a puncture in the leather piece on the side of the center storage trim (where the passengers left thigh would be up against).
5. And of course, the light still didn't work.

I have made another service appointment and am going to express my frustration with them. Hopefully they can get it all fixed and this won't happen to any of you!

Tesla needs to take service more seriously. It's unfortunate that such an amazing brand with amazing products is brought down by horrible service.

&#x200B;

**Update:** I received a voicemail this morning around 9AM from Tesla saying they wanted to talk to me about my experience and make it right. The guy stated that they had talked to the mobile service tech already about the situation and wanted to get another, more experienced mobile service tech to me asap to fix all the issues.

I was unavailable to call them back until around 2PM, which was when I received another call followed by a text from someone at Tesla who said he had a service tech he could send over today to fix the issues. I called back and he apologized for what had happened. He said he had a more experienced service tech that he could have come over to my house within an hour.

An hour later, a service tech named Frank arrived with a second service tech. He was extremely kind and apologetic. He didn't ask me any questions, as I assume he had already been updated on everything that had happened. He said he'd take care of everything and call me back outside when he was done.

Within 10 mins he called me back out and said they were all done. Pictures below. He replaced the center console trim that the previous tech had poked a hole in. He changed the glovebox entirely since the previous tech had left it with a bunch of scuffs/scratches. All the trim pieces were back in place like they should have been. He also had the glovebox light working, which was my original problem. I asked what the issue was with the glovebox light and he said one of the wires wasn't plugged in internally. He also made it sound like it was the simplest thing to fix and that the previous technician had no idea what he was doing. He apologized again and I thanked him for making everything right.

THIS is the kind of service experience owners should get every time. Frank was kind, understanding, professional, and so easy. I appreciate the care Tesla showed in wanting to make things right.

Just a tip, make sure you guys fill out the post-service surveys that Tesla emails you after a service job is completed. Also, make sure your notes for the service team are detailed when making an appointment on the app. I made sure to voice my frustration about the previous tech/incident in my service notes for the next appointment that was scheduled for February 20th (that was the earliest slot open for the Burbank service center). Needless to say, I'm glad this was all taken care of the way it should have been originally much sooner than expected.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,bz3mpu,The company won't survive if they don't improve delivery.,"This subreddit is pro-Tesla. I used to be one of them. I get this post will be met with downvotes, but this needs to be said. I loved Nikola and what he stood for back in his war vs Edison. I love Elon and his vision. But actually buying a Tesla made me lose faith in the company, here is why:

Sales, sleazy like the rest:

Show gallery was painless. Driving the car was cool (I knew I was going to buy so I made their job easy). The sales advisor gave me a quote for my trade in before I bought. But the delivery advisor won't honor it. So basically sales advisor mislead me to get me to buy, reminds me of any sleazy used car salesman.

Delivery advisor turnover:

With the frequency my delivery advisors get back to me, you'd think I'm collecting their credit card debt, not trying to give them money. I had to switch advisors because I changed delivery locations. The second advisor literally returned 0 of my 10 calls or emails. 4 weeks later I found out that he no longer works with the company. I had to call the sales gallery to move forward on my delivery. If this guy quits. Shouldn't be email get forwarded to someone else?? A 38Billion (lowered recently) market cap company doesn't have a process in place to return my emails about delivery if there is a delivery advisor turnover?!?!? I wonder how many people they aren't delivering to because of delivery advisor turnover.

Lack of training for new delivery advisors:

I get they are pushing for a Q2 goal. They probably hired a tons of new help for just meeting that goal. One of the reasons I took delivery a little later was because I wanted HW3 on my build. So when I was assigned my VIN for my delivery, I called to verify my car had HW3 installed. ""I haven't heard anything about a hardware 3 or FSD computer on the Tesla intranet. We don't have that"". ""We don't give you your purchase agreement until you take delivery"" (I need a purchase agreement for my financial institution to transfer funds, so I can pay for the car before delivery‚Ä¶ catch 22 huh??) It took me 3 hours and 5 calls to get through to him that I wasn't lying about hardware 3 or the purchase agreement.

Sales computer system stuck in the 90s:

I still haven't paid for my car. The reason the purchase agreement didn't generate is that their online portal where I entered the financial institution info DOES NOT communicate with their internal sales portal. I called 3 times today just to repeat the financial institution information that I filled out 3 days ago. However, the delivery advisors can't access their own sales portal either. So I STILL do not have a purchase agreement or guarantee of title. I called them again 6 hours later and they stated that I won't be getting a purchase agreement despite giving them all the info for the 2nd time today.

I am determined to get my model 3, I will buy another Y or the truck in a few years for my parents. But how many are left that are willing to churn through bad experiences to get a car? Any one of the above points is enough to push a qualified buyer towards a competitor. The average American doesn't have the will/expertise/patience to churn through these experiences. ~~The frustrating part is that it will cost trivial amount from Tesla to fix these problems.~~ This company won't survive if they don't fix the problems.

&#x200B;

Edit: as someone below points out, the cost is not trivial.

Edit 2: I had the email of the sales advisor telling me my trade in would be $1k higher than the official trade in. I'm not making this up as what i think i deserve. I was quoted a price by Tesla sales. To those of you that say I should have used the official trade in system: the sales advisor sat me down on his computer and showed me a number. On top of that, he emailed me the number again!! All this happened BEFORE I placed my deposit!! He mislead me on purpose to get the sale. And I did not know there was a trade in system until after I placed my deposit. 

Edit 3: Truth be told. I think the company will survive. I sincerely hope it does. I am asking officially for the mods to rename the thread to ""Delivery issues are not helping persuade new buyers"" or else Tesla will die.

Update: I have obtained the Guarantee of Title and MVPA. I could totally see how this process would be super easy if I didn't have the above issues.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/bz3mpu/the_company_wont_survive_if_they_dont_improve/,DavidChenghz,7075.0,0.9956
TeslaMotors,frustrating,8l1l3s,...... im a huge tesla fan but ... service :(,"This is becoming brutal. I have yet to have a service experience that comes back positive. In the last 10 months I've been in 5 times for various things. Most recently 2 weeks ago I sent car for annual service, gave them 4 days to complete it while I was out of town. I live 2h away from nearest service center. It doesn't get finished. Turns out the broke one of my rear deflector lights while there and needed to order new parts so my car was there for a week. 

When I received my car it was a mess on interior, it had not been properly cleaned. The winter tires were bagged with these flimsy thin bags with holes in them and put on top of the white seats. The seats were covered in dirt from tires. (When I gave the car I had placed all tires in not on the seats). 

One of my key fobs battery had died (I assumed) and when I got the car back it still didn't work. Was it even tested? Was battery replaced? Was anything done? 

Final straw, I had never had any issues with laying down back seats and today, the first time after service as I'm getting ready to go on a bike trip, my passenger side back seat will not fold down. They had apparently changed some pannel on the passenger side (damaged at previous service appointment) and the seat was stuck. 

30 mins on phone with tesla mobile service we can't fix it. They need it back in service center, 2h away. I don't know what to do it's very frustrating because it is a brutal trend everytime I take the car in for service it comes back with new issues. 

Now let me be clear I love my model X and love what tesla is trying to do. Yes they gave me a loaner last min, yes they delivered my car to my work after the service, and yes they even waived my service fee. But that's not the point. I just want good quality service done properly and I am willing to pay for it done properly and to the level expected for a 6 figure car. 

What is the solution here? Are we just to suck it up? I really look forward to the day where the quality of the service matches the vision of the company and that we can enjoy these vehicles for what they truly are meant to be.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,x8bkix,What should MCU1 owners expect out of their cars?,"Re. Rule2 this is not a request for support or help, rather a request for discussion, ideas, thoughts, on a topic as an owner of a Tesla vehicle, and what to expect out of said vehicle as it ages.

I recently brought my model S to the service center for various reasons, one of which is that my MCU1 keeps acting up: occasional reboots, sluggishness, poor voice recognition performance, long times solving/mapping a navigation request, etc.

My service tech said that this is due to too much data being stored over time, and they will simply clear out some of the memory for me. ""You already did that 3 months ago.  It helped for about a month."" I told him.   He said in that case he recommends people do a factory reset on their cars every year or so.  

I pushed back, saying that having to reset my $80k luxury sedan every year isn't acceptable.  His response was basically ""it's a computer"" i.e. just like phones/computers they need to be cleared out every so often.

My response was ""no, it's a car, and an expensive one at that.""  I'm a techy guy.  I know about maintaining computers and phones as they age, and having to do a fresh install of an OS occasionally to keep said device snappy.  I don't think this should be expected of a car, let alone a high end luxury one, and only just 5 years old this month.  If the old MCU1's don't have the capacity to store all the data they collect while maintaining a good user experience, then they should write code into them to automatically purge logs and data older than X months or whatever.

So, I'm looking for thoughts from this community (those of you with MCU1 cars).  

Is this acceptable, having to do a full factory reset of your car every year or so? 

Have you done this, did it help?

Do you think it's acceptable that we should be expected to pay for an MCU2 upgrade to solve this problem (and who's to say the MCU2's won't suffer the same kind of issues in 5+ years)?  I don't really want Netflix and Youtube on my MCU, but I sure would love the higher performance of the MCU2.

Just wondering if I'm being unreasonable here, and if there are others who are suffering with a poorly performing MCU1.  FYI, my MCU1 received the daughterboard replacement a couple years ago for the EMMC chip failures recall.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/x8bkix/what_should_mcu1_owners_expect_out_of_their_cars/,seenhear,29778.0,0.9216
TeslaMotors,frustrating,r364ip,FSD passing lane woes,"Anyone else having issues with FSD keeping you in the left passing lane of a two lane state highway? Been traveling this week and put over a thousand miles on the car with 80-90% of it on FSD. I had several times where I was on a 4 lane non-interstate highway (two lanes on each side with divider between them) and the car refused to stay in the right lane. It constantly wanted to switch into the left lane and stay there. I just wanted to drive in the right lane but if I engaged FSD it would always immediately switch into the passing lane and stay there. If I signaled to go back to the right lane it would switch back like 15 seconds later. It drove me crazy. I thought in one case it was because I had a left turn coming up 60 miles ahead but then it did it again on another highway where I had a right hand exit 20 miles up. I kept switching to the right lane to let traffic go by me but then it would just change back into the passing lane. It did it several times as traffic was coming up on me quickly and I had to abort. Man, it was more frustrating than the phantom braking and I ended up disengaging for several stretches due to it. I haven't seen anyone else mentioning it but I can't be the only one.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,cdboyu,"This car, and specifically Autopilot, has unlocked living my dream country living lifestyle"," [https://imgur.com/a/f5TjpSX](https://imgur.com/a/f5TjpSX) 

Have always wanted to live ""acreage"" lifestyle but career limits me to living in major centers. With this car on the way, I made the leap of faith and we bought a house with a 100 mile, round trip, per day commute.  With no traffic it's 60 mins door to door each way. Most of the time it's between 90 to 120 mins each way.  This would be a complete non-starter for me in a traditional car. I don't mid driving, but stop and go traffic on the freeway is the most frustrating thing I can imagine dealing with. The monotony, frustration, and physical/mental strain of stop and go freeway traffic is something that I really don't handle well.

Before the M3 arrived (was here for a few weeks commuting in a pickup truck), I would arrive at work exhausted and in a bad mood, then get home to the family at 8pm, completely ruined, after sitting at work too long, waiting for traffic to die down, and then still dealing with bumper to bumper for a good part of the drive.

I now look forward to the really congested parts of the commute as it's my chance to ""check out"" and let Autopilot do its thing.  Still watching the road just in-case, but the benefit from the reduction in mental strain is difficult to overstate. I get to work energized, leave at 5pm with no qualms about dealing with traffic, greatly enjoy the down time on the freeway, and get home able to enjoy being a capable parent/husband.

I didn't think living this lifestyle would ever be possible, but this car has made living my dream life possible.

As an extra bonus, I did the math on how much it's costing to commute, and turns out it's roughly $2 per day in electricity at $0.10/kwh.  The truck was using a full tank per week at $80 or so.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,i3re6e,"Service center says ""Climate control odors are not covered under limited warranty"" for model 3","Those of you who got the mildew AC smell covered under warranty, how did you do it? What did you say to the service center? It is annoying that some service centers will cover this problem and other service centers expect you to pay for it.

&#x200B;

I recently bought a used 2018 model 3.

Drove it for the first few months, when it started getting hotter where I live I began to blast the AC, something I did not try to do when test driving the car (my mistake, I know). 

But blasting the AC, my god. It smells like mold dipped in vinegar and left to bake in the sun for years. I found other tesla owners with the same problem have varying degrees of success. I have read that some people bring their model 3 into the service center and they were able to successfully solve the problem and have it covered under warranty.

&#x200B;

But others (like me) have been told that climate control odors are not covered under the warranty and had to either DIY solve the problem (buy air filters, buy the AC cleaner, open the panels, spray the cleaner, reinstall filters, etc.) or simply pay out of pocket for the problem (service center quoted me roughly $110)

&#x200B;

My understanding is that Tesla released a software update to help reduce the source of the mold smell - after parking and leaving your car the fan will turn on high for a while to remove any condensation or moisture left on the AC, which causes the mold smell.

&#x200B;

But apparently the cars that were affected before this update will still have the mold smell. 

&#x200B;

Since Tesla released a software update to fix the mold smell aren't they admitting that this problem is not due to user error and as such should be covered under warranty?

I'd rather not spend the money to DIY when I know this problem is not created due to user error. Any help?

Edit:
After sending another message that this is due to manufacturer defect, Tesla should cover under warranty, this is acknowledged by Tesla since they released a software update to fix, etc. They just replied the same ""unfortunately this is not covered under warranty message.""

They told me parts and labor cost for cabin filters was $65. 

The total cost for parts and labor for disinfecting the AC and replacing cabin filters was $120.

I asked if they could install 3rd party filters I bought to save me some money but they said they're unable to install 3rd party accessories.

I would go through with paying for this repair out of pocket if that meant they could then warranty their work.

Like if I pay them $120 now to remove the mold smell and the smell comes back in like a year or two I have to pay them another $120? I'd be fine paying this amount if they could warranty it and offer free repair for any future mold smell.

Edit 2:

I called and spoke to someone at the service center. They told me that the mold smell has never been covered under warranty (!?). They then said that mold smell falls under cabin filter maintenance which is something the customer always pays for.

I texted the service center and asked them if I pay for the repair and the smell comes back in a year or two would I have to pay them again? This was their response:

""It depends on when it returns. We've seen majority of them don't return, but there has been an occasion where after a year + it did, and is responsible by the customer. If it were to return within a very short period, we would have to present the detail to management for approval on covering the cost.""

Pretty frustrating, I guess I'll just cancel my appointment and DIY. Anyone know easy tools to lift up and pop out the panels that hide the evaporator oils?",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i3re6e/service_center_says_climate_control_odors_are_not/,quazimootoo,10218.0,0.9742

TeslaMotors,frustrating,8b236u,3 Weeks of Model 3: A Review,"Warning: massive wall of text incoming.  TL;DR - This car is an absolute joy to own and has exceeded my expectations on almost every level.  Tesla will enjoy success over the next several years to the extent that they can crank these out in high volume with consistent quality and reliability.  Overall score: 8.5 / 10

I've been a massive Tesla enthusiast since 2012 when I began seeing Model S on the road and became curious about this strange Silicon Valley company that wanted to electrify the global auto industry.  I was among the first in line to reserve a Model 3 at the Santa Monica showroom on 3/31/2016.  Nearly two agonizingly long years later, my Model 3 was ready to configure on 2/22/2018.  On 3/22/2018 I took delivery of a beautiful Pearl White Tesla Model 3 long range with premium upgrades, 19"" sport wheels and enhanced autopilot features, VIN 100XX.  Here's my review.


**Delivery Experience: 9/10**

I arrived at the Marina Del Rey delivery center a few minutes early for my appointment and was greeted warmly by the two gentlemen at the front desk.  I made my way into the swanky lounge where there were a few other families waiting for their cars and where a barista was preparing free beverages at the coffee bar.  After a few minutes my delivery specialist took me to my car, went over all the main features and had me set up my driver profile and app.  She then drove the car around to the front of the facility while I went back into the lounge to review and sign some paperwork with a different specialist.  I have to dock one point here as there was a minor hiccup regarding payment.  I had paid the entire outstanding balance for the car online several days before delivery but my specialist seemed to think I still owed some money.  She had to go back to her office for a few minutes and review some things while I waited to confirm that I did not owe any balance on the car.


**Fit and Finish: 10/10**

I guess I'm one of the lucky ones but I have not noticed any issues here.  Panel alignment is perfect, interior is solid with zero noises or rattles, paint is smooth.  


**Reliability and Service: 5/10**

This is where things get ugly for a bit.  As an apartment dweller without home charging access, I'm relying on ChargePoint stations at my office building and my gym for day-to-day charging.  On my third day of ownership, my second attempt to charge at work failed.  I plugged in the adaptor and ChargePoint cable and the car did not begin charging.  The charge light did not change in color and the charge port door began closing on the cable.  I shrugged off the issue until later in the morning, when I encountered the same behavior at my gym's charging station.

I called Tesla roadside assistance and described the issue.  They had me go through some rigmarole--rebooting the car, trying to plug in the adaptor first and then the cable.  Still nothing.  The roadside assistance rep suggested I contact ChargePoint to troubleshoot the issue or download the PlugShare app to find other public charging options.  I became frustrated as I was fairly confident there was an issue with the car and not with these charging stations or any user error on my part.  The rep finally suggested I contact the West L.A. service center.

I called West L.A. service and explained the issue.  The woman on the phone was extremely dismissive, said they would not be able to see me because they were ""totally slammed"" and would not have any loaners to give me.  At this point I was starting to get pissed.  The car was three days old with less than 100 miles and all I got was ""sorry, can't help you.""

I then called the Centinela service center which is way further and less convenient for me.  The woman who answered said I could go straight there and that the techs would be available to help me. 

Everyone at Centinela service was friendly and helpful.  I waited there while the techs confirmed that my charge port was indeed defective.  There were some loose connections inside that they had to re-attach and re-secure.  After an hour or so I was back on the road in a fully-functioning Model 3.  Massive props to Centinela service for being awesome, but I shouldn't have had to waste a day of my life resolving this issue in the first place.  Hopefully this will be the only major issue for a while and this score can improve over time.  


**Ride and Handling: 9/10**

Enough has been written about this so I won't re-hash too much.  This car is simply a blast to drive and I look forward to getting behind the wheel every single time.  I'm coming from an ND Miata which is an incredibly fun car to drive but in totally different ways.  I have heard several people compare the 3's handling to the Miata but I can't say I agree.  I find that the Model 3 corners as confidently, but it's about 65% heavier and I can certainly tell.  It feels firmly planted to the road--more so than any car I've ever owned--and there is zero body roll, even on aggressive turns.  I find the suspension well-tuned and I'm getting just enough feedback from the road although this is subjective.  Acceleration never gets old.

I'm still getting used to one-pedal driving but I'd love for regenerative braking to be a bit more linear.  Braking is very aggressive at first when you take your foot off the accelerator, but the car crawls too much during the last 8-10 mph which means you have to start slowing down unreasonably soon when approaching a red light or stop sign.  Braking should be slightly more aggressive during those last few yards, IMHO. 


**Autopilot: 8/10**

TACC and Autosteer are total game changers.  I've had zero issues so far on L.A. freeways.  Even though I remain alert while autopilot is engaged, I find it incredible how much stress and anxiety the feature reduces.  I no longer care about how fast I'm going or what lane I'm in.  It makes long drives relaxing and enjoyable, and it makes stop-and-go situations infinitely more bearable.  I do think TACC could be refined a bit as braking and acceleration are still somewhat jerky in total stop-and-go situations.  

Auto lane change is great when traffic is flowing well but doesn't work when things are a bit more dense, which is when it would be the most useful.  

Autopark is totally useless and I‚Äôm kinda surprised Tesla has shipped it in its current state.  The appearance of a blue ""P"" icon is unpredictable, inconsistent and sometimes hilariously wrong.  It sometimes indicates a parking space in an *inner lane of moving traffic*.  It usually fails to show up when I'm driving slowly along the curb ready to park.


**Hardware Quibbles**


* The push-button mechanism to open doors from the inside is bad design, based on how consistently my passengers have had trouble figuring it out.  If people of all ages are taking the better part of a minute to figure out how to exit a car, accidentally moving windows up and down in the process, then it's time to go back to the drawing board.  It's especially bad in the front passenger seat where more often than not, my passenger uses the emergency escape latch instead of the push-button.  I wouldn't care if it weren't for the anxiety-inducing message that pops up on the center screen when they do this.  I shouldn't have to tell every new passenger ""don't use this latch to open the door--Tesla says it might damage my window trim.""  I wish they'd somehow managed to combine both mechanisms into one latch, with the mechanical fallback in case of power failure  


* The action on the signal / wiper stalk sucks.  It‚Äôs way too sensitive and I often accidentally flash my high beams when signaling, or start signaling the opposite way trying to cancel an active signal


**Software Quibbles**

* The white for daytime / black for nighttime background on the center screen is a really nice touch.  But when I'm driving at dusk the sudden switch to black is pretty jarring and distracting, especially when it takes a moment for me to realize what happened and that nothing is wrong.  They should add a smoother transition here, or maybe not change the background at all during an active drive.

* Voice command feature doesn't work at all during no / poor connectivity and it took me way too long to figure that out.  Please make basic commands work when there is no data available, or please give a ""sorry, voice command not currently available"" message when there's no data connection so I don't have to give the same command over and over like an idiot and wonder why the car won't respond.

Tesla is renowned for its snappy interface, at least on its newer cars, but is there any room for improvement?

#Pedal lag

Pedal lag was the first thing I looked at, and we're looking explicitly for the time gap between pressing on the accelerator pedal, and when any amount of power is applied physically, i.e. when the car starts to move. (This doesn't necessarily equate to throttle response on ICEs!). With electric cars, this may even become primarily a software problem, rather than necessarily a hardware issue (where motors are renowned for their 'instant torque'.

Anyway, on a low-speed wind day in a safe area, I placed a modern phone camera (capable of 60 frames per second) resting in the driver side footwell, placed it against the side, and used the mat to secure it in place (see [photo](https://www.skytopia.com/project/tesla/lag/camera2s.jpg)). I then strategically angled the phone so that it has a [simultaneous view](https://i.imgur.com/r7tQL4B.png) of the aluminium pedal AND the outside, assuming the door is left open.

[Here is the video](https://www.skytopia.com/project/tesla/lag/pedal540-4M.mp4) from one of the multiple tests I did.

Zooming into the video, and finding the [colour difference between images](https://www.skytopia.com/project/tesla/lag/difference-image.png), I was able to nail a latency down to around 50 milliseconds. This represents an upper limit as noise becomes an issue at these precise levels of time and resolution.

50 milliseconds is not a bad result! Quite a good one actually, and better than I originally expected. Room for improvement? Sure, though it's tricky to gauge how noticeable it would be. If we take a look at [this video](https://youtu.be/vOvQCPLkPt4?t=52) from a Microsoft researcher, we can see that even 10 milliseconds is noticeable in some situations, and 1ms is close to ideal.

#Touchscreen latency

Secondly, I tested to see how responsive the touchscreen was. Hardcore gamers who try to shave milliseconds off their input lag during play will know what I mean: You feel more connected to the game, and it generally makes for a smoother and more enjoyable experience.

Unfortunately, touchscreens are particularly susceptible to lag, and the [aforementioned video](https://youtu.be/vOvQCPLkPt4?t=52) is well worth a watch to demonstrate how even 10 milliseconds can be too much.

I tested [various often used buttons](https://www.skytopia.com/project/tesla/lag/button-presses270.mp4) (200ms lag), the [Climate button](https://www.skytopia.com/project/tesla/lag/climate_button270.mp4)  (185ms lag), [map scrolling](https://www.skytopia.com/project/tesla/lag/map-scroll270.mp4)  (110ms lag), [Menu tab changing](https://www.skytopia.com/project/tesla/lag/menu-selection270.mp4)  (185ms lag), the ['Start' button](https://www.skytopia.com/project/tesla/lag/start-menu-270.mp4)  (170ms lag), [temperature changing](https://www.skytopia.com/project/tesla/lag/temp-change270.mp4)  (205ms lag), [window scrolling](https://www.skytopia.com/project/tesla/lag/window-scroll270.mp4)  (105ms lag) and the [keyboard](https://www.skytopia.com/project/tesla/lag/keyboard270.mp4)  (100ms lag).

The original videos are much longer and higher quality. Overall, I found a latency of around 100-200 milliseconds which isn't great to be honest. Current touchscreen technology is at least partially to blame, but Tesla can immediately improve the experience on many occasions by at least 50 milliseconds if that click is registered at the moment the finger touches the screen (""finger-down""), RATHER than when it leaves the screen (""finger-up""). This won't be ideal for some elements that are immediately draggable, but for controls like simple buttons, opening windows/menus, and changing the temperature, the opportunity is there to shorten the perceived lag by around half!

#Testing startup to Drive mode latency

Finally, [some users](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/x3pu7o/change_i_just_noticed_the_frunk_now_opens_without/imt6sk5/) (including myself) have noticed that the car frustratingly doesn't immediately allow you to switch into the Drive gear after you press the foot brake pedal. There's a short delay that you need to wait out before adjusting the gear lever.

To test for latency, the obvious idea is to keep hammering the gear lever (approx every 0.2 sec) until we see the Tesla show the 'D' icon (Drive) change from the 'P' icon (Park). Unfortunately, for some reason, the car doesn't like this very much and as a result just causes further delay (around 3.5 seconds based on [this video](https://www.skytopia.com/project/tesla/lag/hammering-drive-mode.mp4) before allowing you to switch into Drive).

Better to use a higher delay (say 0.4 seconds) between gear lever presses. To accurately keep interval timing, I used a metronome and timed my gear lever presses to the sound of the metronome beat, with the first press to happen simultaneously with the foot brake push (and hold). Using this technique, I found the vehicle switched to drive mode on the 3rd lever pull at around 0.8 seconds.

Experimenting with other metronome timings, 84bpm specifically (which failed on the second lever pull), I found a lower bound of 0.7 seconds, so we can estimate the true lag before the car allows you to switch to Drive mode is around 0.75 seconds. This is sometimes a painful wait, especially if you pull the gear stick too early, and find it doesn't switch at all.

#Summary and conclusions / TLDR

We found a pedal lag of around 50 milliseconds, a touchscreen lag from around 100-200 milliseconds and a ""preflight check wait to allow Drive gear"" wait of around 0.75 seconds (750 milliseconds). The above three summaries are the areas where I think Tesla can most improve in regards to latency. I hope Tesla takes note of these concerns to help make driving the car a more pleasurable and 'snappy' experience!

TeslaMotors,frustrating,d7tjxs,My first charging experience at an IONITY charging station,"**tl;dr: Tried an Ionity charging stall for the first time. Complete failure. Won't be using it again and won't count on it for trip planning.**

On the way back home from a short trip, my Model 3 LR battery was a 14% and I had the choice to go to the supercharger nearby (3 km detour, 0.24 ‚Ç¨/kWh), or try the fancy new Ionity charger at the highway stop (no detour, flat rate 8‚Ç¨ per charging session), or just continue home (5 km away, can charge overnight).

Given the circumstances, Ionity was more bang for the money than the Tesla supercharger (getting up to 80% would have cost 12‚Ç¨ at the supercharger, or 15‚Ç¨ to fill up to 100%), and I was looking forward to a full battery for the rest of the day. So I chose the Ionity station.

**Step 0**: Park and follow instructions. I first entered a stall with the charging hose on the right of the car (lack of habit), then moved to another one with hose on the left. Was greeted by a crude stall screen with instructions in English. I think there's a law here (France) that things must be labelled in French. Maybe I'm wrong, I'm not a Frenchman.

**Step 1**: plug the cable to the car. Used to the charging hoses in Tesla Supercharges, this one is much more rigid and hard to handle. There's no magic button so I need to tap on the flap to open it. Plugging in doesn't feel as snug as with a Tesla plug or just a regular T2 plug, and due to the stiffness of the hose, the plug doesn't seem to sit perfectly straight. The led on my car shows blue so I figure it's correctly plugged anyway. The screen on the stall now indicates I need to complete payment. So far so good.

**Step 2**: Figure out how to pay **(Failure #1)**. I'm not a Ionity customer, so I need to pay as a guest, fair enough. To do that, I have to scan a QR code specific to the stall where' I'm parked. That QR code takes me to a generic Ionity webpage, where I need to browse a map to find my location. When I zoom into my location, there's a ‚ë£ sign drawn in the map to indicate the 4 stalls at my location, and by tapping on that sign, it unfolds into a star-shaped ""select one of the four"" display with one icon for each charging station. Which one of them corresponds to my stall? No way of knowing. I could have selected any of the four and paid for it, but I'm just maybe a tad savvy and choose the one whose serial number matches the one physically printed on the stall, then proceed to the payment page while the stall screen just sits there waiting.

**Step 3**: Payment. On my mobile phone I manage to enter complete credit card details, payment goes through, my bank confirms the operation. Flawless. (By this time, I would already be near the Tesla Supercharger, had I chosen the other option.)

**Step 4**: Charge? **(Failure #2)**. Once the payment goes through, the screen on the stall refreshes to a rather confusing message: ""[Charging is delayed until power is available.](https://imgur.com/mq110ua)"" Not really knowing what to do about it, I just wait around for 10‚Äì20 seconds. The screen then refreshes to something worse: ""[Charging error. Communication problems. Car should be turned off.](https://imgur.com/oNpH2kS)"" and a battery icon showing 0% on the stall screen. Confusion turns into disappointment and frustration. Without any other hint on what to do on the screen, I decide to unplug cable, see if plugging it back in helps. It doesn't: the screen goes back to the 'new customer' welcome page. So I just drive away, no point in repeating the process again as there was no indication of what was the problem to begin with, and I have never ever had to ""turn off"" my car in order to charge (nonsense?). (I would already be +5 kWh at the supercharger...)

**Step 5**: Reach out to customer service **(Failure #3)**. At home, the [Ionity contact website](https://ionity.eu/en/contact.html) provides a French number for customer support. Since I am in France and speak French regularly as my main language, that's the number I call, and get two automated options: *Please press 1 for English, bitte dr√ºcken Sie 2 f√ºr Deutsch*. (Hint: that's not French).

I don't press anything and a few moments later, a lady picks up the phone and mumbles something I could not understand, with some background noise and bad cell reception. The rest of the conversation goes as follows:

>(me) ""All√¥, vous m'entendez ?"" (Hello, can you hear me?)  
>  
>(lady, in an Eastern European accent) ""Hello?""  
>  
>(me) ""Vous parlez Fran√ßais ?"" (Do you speak French?)  
>  
>(lady) ""No, sorry, only English or German.""  
>  
>(me): ""Oh, I am calling a French number so I was expecting to be greeted in French.""  
>  
>(lady) ""No, sorry, only English or German.""

At this point I realize the source of the noises and bad cell coverage I've noticed: she's an on-call employee taking my call while at her home, and I'm disrupting her quiet Sunday.

>(me): ""Ok. Anyway... I had an issue a few minutes ago, I tried to charge, entered my credit card details, had confirmation from bank, but then the charging session failed to start""  
>  
>(lady) ""Oh in that case don't worry, the bank transaction won't go through and your funds will be reverted""

She doesn't need to know when this happened? At which station? What error message? Are these failures so frequent?

>(me) ""So, no charge means I don't pay‚Ä¶""  
>  
>(silence)  
>  
>(more silence)  
>  
>(huh, this is getting awkward now)  
>  
>(me) ""Okay then... have a good day?""  
>  
>(lady) ""Goodbye"" and hangs up.

**Step 6**: Share this on Reddit as a warning to fellow EV drivers. That's where you help spread the word.

In conclusion, unexplained failure to deliver a simple service, very poor user experience, outright unacceptable customer service (not speaking French on a French support number) and a perceived feeling that I'm bothering them by attempting to use their services.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/d7tjxs/my_first_charging_experience_at_an_ionity/,TheAcanthopterygian,14491.0,-0.9965

I would hate for this to be the reason I don't buy a Tesla. it's frustrating to think that one of the safest cars ever made would translate to one of the highest premiums I have ever seen.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,6trv62,Dealership vs Tesla Showroom experience,"So as you can tell by the flair, I am a Tesla employee. So I'd suggest taking what I say with at least a slight grain of salt as I'm definitely biased. But I wanted to vent my frustrations with the traditional dealership model and contract them at least a little bit with the Tesla Showroom model. The reason why is today I had my first real experience with a big brand dealership. I went down to a Chevrolet dealer to test drive one of their Chevrolet Volt's to hold me over until I can get either a Used S or a Model 3. So I get there and the test drive was quick to get to and fine to drive (the car was mangled in a couple cosmetic ways but nothing dealbreaking). By the end of the time with the drive it was plenty pleasant, then the salesperson asked if I would like to talk numbers on the car. I was there to buy it so of course, we go into his little office in the side of the wall with a single door and large glass windows. Then he asks for the keys to my car and my registration. Odd to me that he wants it before we even make a deal or go over the cars but whatever. So we get to talking a bit of numbers and I point out the cosmetic.. ahem, *imperfections* the Volt had. So this is the first part where he dismisses himself to go talk to his Sales Manager. Then he returns and we work out a bit of a deal on the price of the car, and then dismisses himself again to talk to his Sales Manager. Comes back, ""Congratulations! We have a deal!"" I wasn't even totally complete on clarifying what I wanted because he dismissed himself so quickly, and what I wanted was the price lowered and I'd take care of the cosmetic stuff myself sometime down the road but he straight pushed me to get service to take care of it all ""For free"". I clarified and he went to check with his Sales Manager **again**. Came back and said that was fine. Ok great. During the long stretches of downtime where I was waiting on word from the Sales Manager I also heard the other employees talking about me because they either saw the paystub I had provided or just heard that I work for Tesla, that made me feel real comfortable. Then I got to talk to the financing agent and since I found the monthly payment to be far too high it resulted in at least 3 more ""Going to talk to the sales manager""'s. And she also tried to get me to convince my parents to give me money for a down payment to get it lower (I'm 19 so this is relevant) and that just appalled me. In my head that was the point where I decided not to buy from this dealership. Then she tried to convince me to keep some sort of protection for ""Only $17 extra per month"", and I used to work at Best Buy, so I could tell she was pushing it to get some sort of recognition from it in her tone and explanation of why it was worth it. Finally they stop trying to bring the price lower, hand me my keys, registration to my car, and the salesperson gives me a little talking to about how I kept trying to get the price down and he tried to work with me. Same tone you'd give to a teenager who you caught taking a sip of alcohol. So moral of the story is feel free to walk away whenever you don't feel comfortable with a deal.

Anyways, the Tesla relevant part; I have a newfound appreciation for how we do business in actually selling cars. It wastes no one's time and is straight and to the point. None of this ""Sales Manager"" bullshit. Owner Advisors are trained to know basically everything about the cars and the financial part of buying the cars so you only have to deal with one person in the process. (Which I failed to mention earlier that I asked this sales rep questions like if the Volt we drove had the hold functionality and lane departure/blind spot warning and his only response was ""I'll double check when we get back to the dealership""). I grew numb to how Tesla sells cars because I'm around it everyday and just see it as normal. But getting a glimpse into buying a car from your average dealership (which also has pretty high reviews on Google) was eye opening in understanding what most people go through and see as normal in the industry. Anyways, there's my mainly long rant and part slight contrast to how Tesla does business with customers compared to dealerships. Thanks for reading.


TL;DR: Sales Managers are really just high capacity loading screens on an end of life hard drive. ^^^^^^Yes ^^^^^^that ^^^^^^was ^^^^^^a ^^^^^^metaphor ^^^^^^and ^^^^^^I ^^^^^^will ^^^^^^not ^^^^^^apologise


Edit: I think some people are missing part of my point. Yes I know about the recent postings of shady actions by people who work for Tesla (it's mostly CES btw not OAs). Part of my point was that by nature Tesla's structure of selling cars is still a much more current and pleasant thing to deal with *on average* than a dealership. Please don't assume that I haven't read the recent reports when I've been glued to them recently. I feel like this is a situation where bad experiences are more likely to be shared than good ones. I'd recommend going to your local Showroom if you have one and making your own judgement on what is ""shady"" and what is not on your own.

Also it was a used Volt if that's relevant at all, forgot to mention that part. Oops.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/6trv62/dealership_vs_tesla_showroom_experience/,AnAngryAlien,16732.0,0.9961
TeslaMotors,frustrating,beq1sy,Bad Experience? Return?,"I don't want to draw this out too much, but I picked up my model 3 about 4 hours ago and I've already had nothing but problems and just curious for advice.

&#x200B;

As soon as I drove off the lot, literally 1/2 mile away everything in the car went pitch black. I turned right around and Telsa is trying to tell me this is ""semi normal"". I don't expect a 60k car to ""reboot"" with 4 miles on it. So i give them the benefit of the doubt, they commit it won't happen again for a while after doing some diagnostics.

&#x200B;

They also told me that the auto pilot should start working in 25 miles or so and the camera calibration will eventually reach 100%. I've driven over 60 and its stuck literally on zero. I called support to discuss, they totally agree it should not be on zero, but it also may take 100 miles. They did state if its just sitting on 0 there could be a problem, but offered no solutions.

&#x200B;

Pretty frustrated after just a half day of ownership..

&#x200B;

Thoughts?

&#x200B;

Edit: loving all the downvotes here but check this out. Took it into service center again (only 5 miles from my house). Guy looked at firmware and goes --What the heck is this??? Apparently it‚Äôs a test only firmware car never should have shipped with. They said they are aware of issue with this firmware getting into the wild on a small amount of cars causing issues, but unable to update it and need to escalate to California. They are hoping Cali engineers can OTA update car but they couldn't commit.

&#x200B;

Edit Edit:

SC confirmed car has AP HW3 and has been working with engineering this morning.

Tesla has no software to be able to run HW3 in model 3 they can provide the car and no ETA on when that will be published. They told me that I will not have any features/cruise/lane departure/AP until software exists.

I'm totally psyched to have one of the first AP3 cars, but its unrealistic to have less features than what exists today.

Told them I'll wait until day 6 (Wednesday -- two days after the FSD event), but will likely return car if we can't get these things functioning. Might just be best until software actually runs on HW3, I can wait another month to buy a car.

&#x200B;

Final Edit: Looks like someone in Cali was able to push me firmware - after a few soft reboots car was fully calibrated and working within 6 miles. I DO NOT have sentry mode even though i'm on an 8.5 build -- this sounds consistent with the model X and S that have HW3. Glad tesla was able to get this resolved, sounds like other poster having same issues as me has not gained resolution yet. I'll be keeping the car!",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/beq1sy/bad_experience_return/,xenner,11865.0,0.9845
TeslaMotors,frustrating,ashqx9,[Discussion] Tesla Delivery Mishaps has driven me to the point of no longer wanting a model 3.,"TL;DR. Ordered a car, scheduled delivery pushed back, Told it was because of weather delays. 3 days later find out the car never left and they want $1000 more.

Sorry about how long this is but I need to share the whole story. 

I‚Äôm livid right now, I had heard about how much better the experience of buying a vehicle from Tesla is over your standard dealer and I‚Äôm having the opposite experience. So much so, that I‚Äôm on the verge of canceling my order and waiting for an auto manufacturer with their shit together to release an EV. 

After Test driving a model 3 a month ago, I was sure I wanted to get one. I was having a hard time deciding between the long range awd and mid range rwd because I wanted the range, but didn‚Äôt need the AWD and I‚Äôd be stretching to afford either. Someone from Tesla contacted me here on reddit actually and told me there was still some RWD long range models available. After emailing back and forth (from an @tesla email), and having him show me some vehicles online I found the perfect one. A White RWD Long range with a dealer adjustment of $1200 because it had 600 miles on it. After a few days of debating. I decided to pull the trigger and ordered, I was losing sleep before I ordered, and after, I was waking up excited. 

The vehicle was located in Chicago, I live in Maryland, so I understood it would take some time for it to get here. My reddit Tesla contact told me it would take about 3 weeks, so I ordered it expecting to have that much time to get things ready. I had a ski trip planned for this weekend and figured I‚Äôd be fine since the car would be coming after. 

I was surprised  a day after I ordered 2/12 with a text stating my expected delivery date was this Wednesday 2/20 (tomorrow).  This gave me 8 days to prepare. Flustered and excited, I sold some investments for my down payment, shopped for loans, hired an electrician, and got offers on my current vehicle. On a whim I decided to try to sell my vehicle myself, and quickly found an interested buyer who wants to pick up the vehicle up this week. 

I was told the vehicle would be arriving from Chicago to the delivery center last Saturday, and they would be inspecting and detailing it for my pickup on Wednesday. 

I was surprised and disappointed when I received an email from my delivery guy yesterday at 10pm, that my vehicle was delayed due to weather and my delivery date would have to be pushed back till Friday. I understand delays happen, but I wanted more information, at this point the vehicle was already supposed to be here, where was it, why did he wait 3 days to tell me, wouldn‚Äôt he have known last Friday that it was late? 

If I have to sell my current vehicle on Wednesday and receive the new one on Friday, I could survive, but I was worried it would be pushed back again and I would be car-less. 

After a few emails, The delivery guy says there is another vehicle closer that matches my configuration, but that it wouldn‚Äôt come with the price adjustment, the price adjustment is the reason I chose the vehicle. It offset the cost of the paint. I told him I wasn‚Äôt interested. Asked if there were any LR-RWDs in black, any with price adjustments and received no response. 

Frustrated, not knowing where the vehicle I ordered was, not knowing why I was being pushed to order something new, not knowing if I should back out selling my current car I called Tesla, who essentially told me they‚Äôd have my delivery guy call me. 

He didn‚Äôt, he instead roped in someone from the local showroom in an email and I asked her to call me. 

On the phone she told me that the car I ordered had not left yet, asked me if I was aware that there was a $1000 charge to ship the vehicle to my location. I said what!? Why is my delivery guy telling me the truck is delayed due to weather, wouldn‚Äôt this charge have showed up when I ordered the car, it knows where I‚Äôm expecting delivery. I almost feel like she‚Äôs lying to scare me out of the car. My delivery guy straight up lied to me, and reddit Tesla rep is MIA. 

All of the excitement of getting the vehicle has vanished. I feel lied to, scammed. If this is how they treat potential new customers what am I in for when I‚Äôm a current customer and need help. 

She‚Äôs going to call me tomorrow to talk about options for other vehicles closer, but to be honest I‚Äôm very turned off by the entire process I‚Äôm debating canceling and saving my money. 


**Update:**  Reddit Tesla guy emailed me (I stopped talking to him when the delivery center took over). Told me he was confused, car is on the way scheduled to be at my delivery center tomorrow. Maybe the local guys are confused? Will find out tomorrow.

Also, Thank you everyone for the words and opinions, after the anger subsided a bit, I'm starting to feel the excitement coming back.  I'm hoping this all works out.

**Update 2:** have heard from 2 Tesla people that my vehicle is on the way and scheduled to arrive at the delivery center tomorrow. Delivery still scheduled for Friday, not sure why the local dealer told me it wasn‚Äôt on the way and there would be a $1000 delivery charge

**Update 3:** Just as I was feeling better about everything, they crushed me again.  On Friday, I got a call in the morning asking if I was still available that day as they were planning on delivering the car around 5.  Around 6, after hearing from no one i decided to email them.  I got a reply,  ""Hey, going to give you a call in a few minutes"". at 9pm (3 hours later) I got a call.  The car came in late, they were rushing to get it to me, a tpms sensor was going off on one of the wheels, they tried to fix it, but couldn't. a technician is going to work on it on saturday.

On Saturday, i got a text at 11am saying they were working on it. i asked for an update around 3, no response.

On Monday, today, they called and said they're working on it, and asked what time i could expect delivery today. i told them 430/5 but that i'd need to leave work early.

I called them at 2 to get an update, and it doesnt seem like they are anywhere on it.

Now i'm terrified.  If it takes 3 days to fix a tpms sensor. how long is it going to take when i need actual service? What else is wrong with the car.

I already took 2 days of vacation, and cancelled a trip because of this car for nothing, and most of it could have been avoided if they just kept me in the loop.

I don't know how much more i can take.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ashqx9/discussion_tesla_delivery_mishaps_has_driven_me/,emodro,47939.0,-0.9532
TeslaMotors,frustrating,d5kk3a,EV driver renting a Model 3 for the first time.... I'm not sure what I expected.," 

Being a fan on this sub since the Model 3 was announced, I always had it in my mind that I would buy one when the price was low enough or my income was high enough. I see threads here every week where someone test drives a Model 3 and is so amazed by it they immediately buy one.

This past week I was on a trip in LA and my partner and I spontaneously decided to rent a Model 3 on Turo. It was my first time driving a Tesla, and I gotta say, I am not one of those people. I wouldn‚Äôt say I was disappointed with it per se, but I was left, cold I guess, on the experience. I was also confused about several things, so maybe y‚Äôall can help me out while you‚Äôre telling me how wrong I am about the car. We ended up getting a black SR+ (or so I thought, I explain below) with 19‚Äù wheels and FSD; what I would buy in real life is a SR+ in white with 18""s.

Note: I am generally avoiding even talking about common complains that everyone is tired of reading about, like HUD, door handles, confusing exit button, etc.

I have driven/rented a number of cars, but I have only owned my Fiat 500e (ev), and before that a 1994 Volvo 850 (jalopy) with a bangin tape deck and a broken door lock. I‚Äôm 28, so probably fewer cars than average for my age but I consider myself lucky on that. Compared to anything that I‚Äôve driven any distance, the Model 3 immediately struck me with how big it is. It is large, and feels even bigger. Getting inside my passengers and I felt small and enclosed with high door sills and shrinking visibility as you move to the back of the car, culminating with a tiny rear window. I‚Äôve always noticed how small and shrunken people look sitting inside Model 3s, and I could definitely feel that when I was inside. The front has great visibility, so it‚Äôs like wearing horse blinders where you can only see forward.

Driving it enhanced this feeling. You can feel its immense weight, and the strength that it hefts that weight is jarring. It‚Äôs like riding inside a particularly pissed off, bloated bodybuilder. Chill mode makes the bodybuilder sleepy, I guess. EVs are very heavy by their nature, but there‚Äôs a difference between knowing and feeling. All EVs I have driven thusfar have batteries half this size or less, and wheelbases much shorter. Controlling this enormous chemically reactive tank is done through a small, fat, and spongy steering wheel, definitely much less fun to hold than even the leather-wrapped wheel in my 500e. I enjoy hard wheels where you can really grip the leather grain and the stitching, but maybe this is a taste thing.

After a while I got used to the massive weight and the squishy wheel, but I never really got used to the turning radius. Of course, I‚Äôd never expect to compare the radius of my 11-foot fiat with a car that is a full middle-school child longer. But without an engine up front it seems like it could have handled tight parking lots a little better and turned sharper. This definitely felt worse than my 25 year old Volvo, also a mid-sized sedan.

But the sensors! Oh the sensors. My partner enjoyed watching all the other cars on the screen shimmy and dance randomly, glitching around the display during our trip, but I was mostly concerned about how much I could trust the blind spot alert system. On my car, the bubble mirror on the large wing mirror takes care of this easily. Of course the traffic accuracy can be improved with software updates. It got me into trouble once, where I was trying to use the parking sensors to park on a very skinny, curved, dark, steep street in Silverlake. I pulled in to parallel park and FUCK! I rubbed the front passenger wheel on the sharply curving curb, no help from any sensor. I sure paid for that mistake. It would take a lot of practice just to know what the sensors pick up and what they don‚Äôt. I also learned the hard way exactly where the car puts the wheels when it turns, and that the white lines on the back-up camera don‚Äôt really correspond to where the outsides of the rear wheels are.

I‚Äôm not used to driving in LA, but it‚Äôs the natural environment for a Tesla, right? I enjoyed Autopilot and Navigate on Autopilot as far as I was willing to trust it in my short time with the car, especially driving to Malibu. Driving on the highway was notably smoother than my Fiat (duh), but not as smooth and solid as I thought it would be (maybe because of the 19s?). I didn‚Äôt really have any problems navigating LA rush hour, outside of using the frustratingly small wing mirrors. Charging, however, was a mess. I‚Äôm aware that LA superchargers are probably the most crowded in the country, but I was really disappointed that there are no alerts for broken chargers, so it‚Äôs impossible to tell if there are open stalls or not. I guess I should have expected the four-car line at the Santa Monica charger, but it was a Monday early afternoon just after lunch, not a holiday or weekend. I had to skip it and go wait in ANOTHER line in Culver City, still not even at rush hour. We went to the Hawthorne charger the next day and hilariously the navigation couldn‚Äôt actually navigate us to the correct place in the complex, so we got to wander around SpaceX until we found it, and it was really odd and felt like we were trespassing. At least there was no line.

Speaking of navigation, the mapping was generally bad. No alternate routes, it was confusing whether or not it was showing me traffic times, and search was inaccurate. I heard you can send routes from your phone maps somehow, but I did not have access to the app through my Turo host. The experience was actually worse than just mounting my phone to the dash, which sort of defeats the purpose of that big Tesla screen? My partner and our other friends complained about the uselessness of the Tesla mapping system more than once after trying to rely on it.

The other thing that was confusing, our car had 240 miles, making it a SR+, correct? But it also had LTE bars and traffic data, I thought you couldn‚Äôt get LTE in SR+? Not having live traffic in maps is one of my serious deal breakers since I commute daily across Lake Washington in Seattle, needing to decide between i90 and sr520 among other alt routing on a daily basis. It also supercharged at over 100 Kw, I thought SR+ was throttled to 100Kw at superchargers?

If I was wrong and SR+ can get traffic data and charge faster than 100Kw and at Version 3 chargers, that‚Äôs actually a huge plus in my book.

While waiting at the charger I tried out the racing game. I‚Äôm a game designer professionally so excuse my professional bias, but it‚Äôs pretty awful. Terrible kinaesthetic feedback, slapped together assets that have no visual coherency, and it‚Äôs so obviously poorly cribbing everything from Mario Kart that it makes it an even more embarrassing half-assed gimmick. In a car that has a lot of thoughtful cross-disciplinary detail, the games (though non essential) were remarkably weak. I know a dozen studios that need work that would have built something much more charming, professional, and enjoyable.

(Another tiny nitpick: I was shocked that the rounded corners on the display are faked! It‚Äôs not a rounded display at all!)

At the end of the trip, I‚Äôm sad that the Model 3 isn‚Äôt really as fun or interesting as I thought, it seems more like an expensive series of compromises - with many compromises that I already make in my 500e. It was fun to drive, but it‚Äôs big and turns poorly. The software was neat, but the sensor readouts are (as of now) unreliable and invasive. The charging is fast and 240 miles of range is life changing, but there seems to be no care in designing the charging experience, unpredictable wait times et al. It‚Äôs cool, but is it 5x the cost of my current EV cool? I love how safe it is, but I‚Äôm saddened that I just don‚Äôt feel the je ne sais quoi that is so often talked about on the sub?

Unfortunately, it‚Äôs the ONLY reasonable longer-range EV to buy in the USA right now. The range, features, and supercharger network make it the sole serious contender. I wish that felt liberating instead of restrictive to me. I guess my ideal car would be like the Honda E plus a good charging network. I‚Äôm still not sure what I will do when I need to replace my car, maybe y‚Äôall can correct me on some of my misunderstandings. I did trim for brevity but can add detail if needed. Tl;dr didn't feel the Tesla magic, I wish I did.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/d5kk3a/ev_driver_renting_a_model_3_for_the_first_time_im/,ChemtrailDreams,9662.0,0.9837
TeslaMotors,frustrating,pwfna1,"So, I bought a Tesla","Hi, it's me [again](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/mpymod/so_i_drove_a_tesla_for_the_first_time/), a few months later with an update. A couple of weeks ago I got a Model 3.

# Why a Model 3?

I was tossing between the M3, the MY and Hyundai's Ioniq 5. The EV offer in Australia is somewhat more limited than in Europe or the US, so some other popular alternatives just aren't a thing here.

I've had a few (ICE) Hyundais and I like the brand and what they do. The Ioniq 5 looks sleek and is expected to be a bit cheaper than a similar-ish Tesla, but what took it out of the race for me was that it looks like they'll deliver only a few hundred of these cars a year. That for me is a red flag: I worry it'll be a car most people working on it would rarely see, and that it'll be really hard to source parts or accessories. Apparently not all Hyundai dealers and service centres will be equiped to service it.

The MY looks like a great car. Spacious, decent value compared with the M3. But I never owned an SUV, and I don't think I'd enjoy driving one. My driveway is narrow, I do most of my driving in city streets. I know the difference to an M3 is tiny, but still. I also don't love that the (currently available) range is shorter than the M3 LR's. Finally, it's just not for sale here yet, and who knows when it'll come. I'm being impatient, but driving my ICE hatchback was starting to frustrate me. Life is too short.

So that landed me with the M3 LR. I love the range, the nimbleness, the size. It's aesthetically a beautiful car, the best one in the Tesla line-up. In Australia it only comes with the 19"" wheels, which I think are by far the nicest ones of the 3 OEM rims.

# Why red on white?

This was a tough decision. I think all colours look awesome and I'd be happy to own any of them. The white interior gives the car a futuristic and light look which I like. In the end it came down to which colour would I see in the wild and think ""damn, I wish I had gone with that one.""

# Why pay for FSD?

I read a lot of comments about what an idiot you have to be to pay for FSD today. I'm one of those idiots. I bought it for a couple of reasons:

* I hate parking. I hate parallel parking. I can do it, and the cameras make it easier, but I value not doing it
* But really, the main reason is that I hope to keep this car for a loooong time. Like 10 years time. If the technology keeps evolving at even half the pace it has evolved so far, that's still amazing. And I'd want a piece of that eventually, so why not get it now and enjoy it from day 1?

If EAP was on offer in Australia I would have considered it over FSD. But here it's between AP and FSD.

# Why do a full PPF wrap?

Again, a questionable use of money. But this one is simple: it's not that I want to baby a car that costs 5x what my previous ride cost. I have kids, and they walk past the driveway with their bikes and their toys. And they come to the car holding sticks and shells and rocks they collected. Can I instil in them the fear of God to never damage the car? Of course. And I can tell them how it's so so expensive and all of that. But I want them to enjoy the car as much as I do. In that way, paying money for peace of mind and for a bit of extra family happiness is totally worth it. Plus less stress parking the car when shopping and things like that.

I also tinted all side windows with a very light 70% 3M Crystalline. Barely noticeable, but it'll help cut the heat in summer. I thought I'd feel like I was inside a fishbowl and I'd want a darker tint, but after driving the car for a couple of weeks I'm fine with the way it is.

# Final thoughts

I read a lot about build quality, panel gaps and the like. I know this is a problem, and I was stressed about it. But my car was just perfect. No issues at all. I'm not bragging, just balancing the negative stories that totally suck but are likely over-represented online.

And the accessories ‚Äì good grief, there are so many! That I did not expect. I'm embarrassed to list all the crap I've bought, it's a true rabbit hole. On a similar note to what I wrote about PPF, I did get some front seat back protectors and I'm getting good seat covers for the back. I want the ferals to have a good time.

Oh, and it's awesome, it really is!

TeslaMotors,frustrating,o7qdxn,Sentry mode completely disabled for vision-only cars?,"I took my 2021 M3LR into service today to fix a trim issue and for them to look into why sentry mode is suddenly not working. I was surprised what Tesla service told me: while sentry mode worked for a little while on vision-only cars, Tesla has since disabled it to address issues, and will re-enable it with a future software update. When asked when that might be, he said ""probably not years, but likely a couple of months."" Has anyone heard this as well?

My car was delivered in early June and sentry mode initially worked (although was ridiculously sensitive). A few days later, it stopped working completely. You could walk up to the car with sentry on and Bluetooth disabled, try to open the door, and the screen would display the ""use the key card"" message (as opposed to the sentry screen).

It's frustrating that this is yet another feature that was advertised with the car when I purchased it, only to subsequently be removed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/o7qdxn/sentry_mode_completely_disabled_for_visiononly/,slowdive,19355.0,-0.7351
TeslaMotors,frustrating,9jupqr,Prepare for chaos at Fremont Delivery Center this weekend,"I was at the Fremont Delivery Center today for 7 hours to take delivery of our ""inventory"" Model X. I came in expecting to buy one car, and ended up leaving another, since it turned out our inventory car was actually still being built.

They've been selling some cars as inventory before they're actually done, and then when its slightly behind schedule and then having some gaps in communication, it lead to a few frustrated people. We ran into two other couples in a similar situation today. My wife was flexible on the color, so we found an actual inventory model, and upgraded from a 75D to a 100D. So it wasn't a wasted trip, just a really long day.

Everything there is just slammed. There was no single slowdown, everything was simply slow. Our host said they were delivering ~250 cars today (Friday), and supposed to be doing ~450 cars on Saturday. They were proactively calling people to try to come in today rather than tomorrow.

If you're going in to Fremont this weekend, prepare for chaos. Oh, and bring some snacks/drinks, perhaps in a cooler. Serious Tesla, wtf is with only having water and coffee to drink, and granola bars and pretzel bites to eat? Bring in a few vending machines. Get some food trucks to park outside this weekend.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,i4tsov,I Turo‚Äôd a Model S P100DL - My Experience,"After surely getting sick of me ranting and raving about Tesla‚Äôs at nearly every chance I get, my family surprised me with an awesome gift- the rental of a fully loaded P100D with FSD. The host was amazing as was the car and experience as a whole. This wasn‚Äôt my first time driving a PxDL Tesla, but I hadn‚Äôt for anything longer than minutes till now.

However, I don‚Äôt think it pushed me towards being a customer. (get your downvotes ready) my car background- I have an attachment to bmws that I can‚Äôt help. I don‚Äôt seek them out but they‚Äôve given me exactly what I wanted for the price I wanted twice in a row, and seem to have my number this time around, too. I used to own a 650i, then sold it, went car-less for a while and picked up a 328i which was meant to be somewhat temporary, but has ended up serving me quite well save for missing some stuff I‚Äôd like, namely TACC and more power. A family member has an M3 (bmw, not model 3) which I drive fairly frequently. I casually have my eyes on a used 90D to retrofit with ap3, the bmw m550, and the Mercedes e43 AMG. I view the 3 of them as being in the same general territory. I love Tesla and the idea of owning an electric car but I‚Äôm not married to it. And I‚Äôm very picky, perhaps too picky for a Tesla at this time.

The good:

- It goes without saying at, but its acceleration is sublime. It‚Äôs literally heart-stopping and a joy to drive. There‚Äôs nothing else like it.
- Its overall road feel is also completely on point. The ride is just stiff enough to be fun but still comfortable. It handles in a way that lets you mostly (but not completely) forget about its size and weight.
- I think it‚Äôs the best-looking car on the road. I love its design. It hasn‚Äôt changed much in around 8 years and yet it always has me turning my head.
- The body style, large hatchback, is perfect. I wish more automakers embraced it. The only similar ones are the Audi A7, Porsche Panamera and discontinued BMW Gran Turismo. And none of them are executed as well as the Tesla when it comes to utilizing space.
- So much cargo space. More than small and even mid-sized SUV‚Äôs.
- I love the regenerative braking. It‚Äôs very easy to control one‚Äôs speed, both up and down.

The okay:
- I found the front seats to be pretty good. It‚Äôs one of the rare ones that has ventilated seats, and while they aren‚Äôt the best, they actually do do what they‚Äôre supposed to, which is whisk sweat off your back to prevent your shirt from sticking to them. But my family‚Äôs opinions were mixed. Overall they‚Äôre similar, maybe a little lower in comfort to the ones found in 3-series/C-Class/A4 etc. Not at the level of higher-end premium seats.
- Autosteer veered out of its lane several times. I don‚Äôt feel too comfortable relying on it. I don‚Äôt mind steering though, but I find TACC critical. And it‚Äôs very good in that regard. (But competing luxury sedans are pretty competitive here)
- I don‚Äôt want to diminish how exhilarating it is to drive, but there‚Äôs a limit to how much acceleration one can typically make use of. Like many of you I probably see during my daily commute, I spend a decent chunk of time in stop and go traffic on the 101, and no amount of hp can put a dent in that. I drove the (BMW) M3 home after dropping it off so that both cars‚Äô feels were fresh in my mind. The Tesla was noticeably quicker to around 30, but from 50-100, it‚Äôs hard to feel a difference (or even get the opportunity), despite the bmw being objectively slower. Tesla in ludicrous+, bmw in sport+. 
- There‚Äôs a notion that Tesla‚Äôs are untouchable in a straight line, which isn‚Äôt far off, but the likes of the Mercedes e63 and bmw m5 are competitive in price, size and even raw speed numbers. I wish I had been able to try one of those back-to-back with the Tesla.

The not so good:
- The rear seats are terrible. There‚Äôs no sugar coating it. They‚Äôre essentially seat cushions bolted directly to the floor, presumably because the battery is directly below them. They aren‚Äôt even suitable for average sized adults on anything but short trips. Lack of bolsters makes things worse. 
- The cargo capacity is complete overkill yet the rear of the cabin is not as spacious as you‚Äôd expect given the size of the car. Makes me wonder if they could‚Äôve somehow traded some the former for the latter.
- No cup holders in the back. Nor side pockets on the door. Highly inconvenient. Was not fun for my rear passenger holding a cup of coffee getting flung around on the rear bench seats (my gunning the car certainly didn‚Äôt help, and for that I‚Äôm to blame)
- Despite the lack of engine noise, the road noise on the highway is pretty high. We found ourselves yelling to carry a conversation. My BMW‚Äôs sound damping is much better. It‚Äôs also not very composed, it shakes noticeably past around 80, and you can hear the body panels vibrating. Cars literally 5x cheaper wouldn‚Äôt be expected to suffer from this.
- I really missed being able to open the trunk by swiping my leg as is common on other sedans and suvs. Instead, I had to fumble with the key fob with both hands full of groceries.
- The traffic visualization is pretty cool. But it‚Äôs not as effective as a 360 camera coupled with traditional blind spot monitoring. The owner of the car said he swiped one of the rims due to misjudging the width of the car. I understand some patent/licensing issues prevent Tesla from adding a 360 camera view. It‚Äôs too bad, because the lack of it is conspicuous and a frequent complaint.
- I find the infotainment system pretty nice. But the lack of responsiveness of the touch screen coupled with its position make it inconvenient and unsafe to use while driving. The steering wheel controls mostly get the job done.
- I don‚Äôt own a home. Having to use superchargers was frustrating. I live in the Bay Area, but it was still a challenge to find, say, a supercharger with a nearby Starbucks to kill time. I don‚Äôt think I could get used to this, especially on road trips. Both my apartment building and workplace have chargers, though.
- The fit and finish is a tired complaint, but I do think it‚Äôs fair game, along with the lack of convenience features, considering that this car cost as much a decent house in some parts of the us.  Other sport luxury cars in this class have better appointed interiors, though I understand that‚Äôs not that important for many.
- Another common item for the wishlist - a HUD.

Overall, there were so many things I absolutely loved, but there were also several things I couldn‚Äôt forgive. What frustrates me is that Tesla accomplished incredible things and solved extremely tough, unsolved, problems along the way. Yet, they didn‚Äôt solve problems that have been solved by other automakers decades ago. Most of you won‚Äôt agree with me and that‚Äôs okay. The market has spoken, and it says that the pros outweigh the cons to a huge amount of people.

Overall, for the money, the right German ICE sedan seems to offer a similar level of performance, and even technology, with a lot more comfort, so I haven‚Äôt been weaned away from them yet.

I‚Äôm still definitely going to try a model 3 performance, as it looks like even more fun for a weekend, but I expect it to amplify many of my gripes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i4tsov/i_turod_a_model_s_p100dl_my_experience/,gautamb0,8164.0,0.9989
TeslaMotors,frustrating,e59io3,I think Tesla needs to acknowledge how broken the referral program is...,"The Tesla referral/rewards program has completely imploded over the last few years, and nobody at Tesla seems to have noticed or care. I bought a Model X in June 2017, and gave the referral to a good friend. I was given the $1k discount immediately, and he received the referral reward. Ever since then, the referral rewards have scaled back significantly; in 2017-2018, we saw a litany of people offering to re-sell their referral reward wheels, wall chargers, etc.

Even back then, people were talking about how they weren't receiving their wall chargers, or weren't receiving any warning when the wall chargers were sent to them (lots of people came home to find a box on their porch with a $500 wall charger). Frustrating, but rewards were at least getting out (to most people, many never got them).

Early 2019, I got a referral from a friend buying a Model 3, and it was my only referral during the period when 1 referral would give the referrer a ""picture launched into space"". To date, any time I've asked the Tesla Referral email box about it, or even my delivery expert, all they say is that they're working on the upload system to get the picture delivered. Almost a year later, it's hard to believe they couldn't just have an upload inbox. When I emailed the referral program support email, they still maintain: 

>At this time, the option to upload your preferred photo has not yet been made available. Once Elon makes the final decisions and determines a launch date, you will receive an email with instructions on how to upload your image.

I bought a Model X again in June 2019, and tried to use myself as a referral to earn the Supercharger miles; Tesla refused to acknowledge me as the referrer, even though I already have a Tesla and an active account (the old vehicle and my solar). The reason was when I ordered my new Model X, I forgot to use my own referral link URL (even though the order was done through my own Tesla account, which had a previous Model X still on the account). No miles, but no big deal. I then accumulated 2 more referrals, one in early October, the other in late October. The early October Model 3 was delivered, and my Supercharger miles never arrived until I emailed them in early November, after which I was given the miles immediately. To date, over a month later, my 2nd batch of 1,000 Supercharger miles have never arrived. When I asked Tesla about the 2nd referral, I got this reply: 

>Thank you for contacting the Tesla Referral Program. Please provide me with the RN# or the VIN# to the order that you believe you are missing referral credit for. 

So apparently I am expected to get the VIN or RN# from my friend whose vehicle was delivered over a month ago, and it shows in my referral ""loot box"" that they were delivered (and when). However, the referral people still want me to do the investigation into my claims when the whole thing shows on their system as delivered? 

I don't rely on the Supercharger miles, they're just a nice reward to have when I need to Supercharge. I honestly couldn't care less about the picture shot into space. I just think someone needs to call them out on the current state of disrepair in the referrals program. They have the sales and brand recognition, they don't really need it anymore, but they continue to push it. Owners continue to think of it as incentive to take time, convincing not just family but also strangers that a Tesla is the right car for them.

If they have no intention of making good on the referral program, they really should just dismantle it and move on. At this point, the Tesla Referral program is like having lousy wifi: you see it, you're made to believe it works, you did the right things and it should ""connect"", but every time you try to use it, it just collapses and you get no response.

I would think lots of people have similar issues, and perhaps if we could collect everyone's experiences into a single thread and share it around, the current state of the program will get addressed, even if they simply shut it down.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/e59io3/i_think_tesla_needs_to_acknowledge_how_broken_the/,vertigo3pc,363559.0,0.9924

TeslaMotors,frustrating,9jnwqz,PSA - A delivery appointment does not mean there‚Äôs a vehicle for you.,"I think this was stated previously, but I‚Äôll reinforce it based off my experience. Call your delivery center to confirm after you‚Äôre scheduled with an appointment. An appointment does not mean there is a car ready for you. 

I received a text message from the logistics team on 9/25 asking if I was available to take delivery between 9/26 and 9/30. I replied in the affirmative. 

I called the delivery center on 9/26. They indicated there had been 7 unmatched cars that had already been assigned, and if I didn‚Äôt have an appointment I hadn‚Äôt been matched. I assumed no car for me at that point. 

I received a text message on 9/27 indicating a car had been matched to me. I received an email with an appointment for 9/29. My Tesla account page was updated with the appointment. 

I started working immediately to secure financing. One business day would be a heroic effort to turn this around. As soon as the delivery center opened on 9/28, I called to confirm the appointment. The delivery center indicated there was no car matched to me and they cancelled the appointment. 


Tesla is trying to cram as many deliveries into Q3 as possible (I get it). Logistics is scheduling appointments whether there‚Äôs a car or not. The delivery centers are hearing about this from the customers. This is pretty frustrating. I‚Äôm continuing to hang in there.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,54wrlf,Weird situation,"So, my owner adviser called last night and confirmed my inventory car will not be delivered on Friday as they were shooting for. I ordered on the 17th of this month. They are asking me to finalize the sale on Friday regardless of the car being here and pushing the sale through. They are offering to then send me home with a loaner car until my car actually comes in. This is obviously frustrating but sounds like others are going through the same thing. ~~He insinuated that if I don't agree to this then the discounted pricing we already agreed on wouldn't be honored so I guess the deposit I put down only holds me to the terms of the sale not them. I think if I really pressed them on that they would fold but not entirely sure.~~ I am obviously very eager to get my car but any Tesla is better than what I am currently driving and finalizing the sale would at least remove any risk on my side of losing the pricing or my current car breaking down etc. I am kind of concerned about how my insurance company is going to handle this situation(this ended up being moot as they were more than fine with it). I am also a little concerned about finalizing sale of a car I have never actually seen. They did reassure me that when my car gets here if I see any issues with it they will resolve them. Still a big purchase to treat in this way. Anyone else being told similar things or in the same situation? Did you press them on anything? I am probably going to try and get something out of this on their side since they are also going to try and send me home with a 70 when I ordered a 90D so I will be paying for more car than I am leaving there with which is also annoying. Any advice on what I could ask for as compensation for the whole situation? 


**Wow so this kind of blew up in an unexpected way for sure. Guess this is my 15 mins of Reddit ""fame"".Hi Elon :) I think the whole comment above was taken pretty harshly when that was not my intention. I tried to clear that up in comments below but not sure that sticks for whatever reason. I was never threatened on my deal changing in any way and even saying they insinuated was probably a bad choice of words. I am not getting some special deal others aren't getting (trust me I wish) nor is anyone saying any part of my purchase would change whether I finalize this Friday or wait until sometime next month.  

I'm sure the world has moved on at this point but I also just want to say that the whole process with Tesla has been incredible smooth, no pressure, very information heavy process that will ultimately put other dealers out of business. My Owner Adviser has easily been the best part of this entire process and has been available any time night or day for whatever stupid question I had. He also was very understanding as I struggled to make up my mind on the purchase which most dealers wouldn't have tolerated.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,fqa52f,Great cars - Customer service non-existent,"Last year the Model 3 I was driving crashed and the car was totaled. The car had FSD. I tried to contact ""customer service"" which doesn't exist to get data from the crash and also to see if they could help me to get a new car (I'll pay for it).  Sales people were useless. The only person I could talk to was the service manager who was of absolutely no help, actually negative help. He made me wait a month and then sent me the legal web page where it says Tesla doesn't give out data. I got the data despite him telling me I couldn't.  

Sales people told me they couldn't help me with a new car. I contacted Tesla corporate via email and was actually called by a local service person where I live, who was very friendly but did absolutely nothing for me. I believe their sales people and service managers have absolutely no power to make any decisions and do NOT escalate anything to corporate. 

THERE IS NO CUSTOMER SERVICE! I get better service from buying a $10 product on Amazon. 

Said this, Independent of the fact of whether the car might have been faulty (let's not go down the rabbit hole), I thought it might be a nice gesture by Tesla to offer me free FSD. I already paid for it, it was only software, and the car was totaled, so that no one will ever use that FSD. If this was an app on a computer, I would be able to get another version without having to pay. That is now $7K. If we look at the economics of it, I did Tesla a favor by totaling a car; they now will sell an extra car they would not have sold. Wouldn't it be great if everyone totaled their Teslas, they could double their profit. 

Tesla has no customer support contact either via email, chat or in person. Sales and Service are not customer support, at least not at Tesla. They are simply mannequins who either guide you on how to order a car online or in the case of service, send you to a real repair shop.

I was a happy Tesla owner, I  am also a shareholder, and I have a Model Y on order.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,cptfj7,Welp. 1 month in with model 3: Experience with tesla taking a bad turn.,"/rantmodeon

Took delivery of my blue model 3 last month. Everything seemed fine, no dreaded panel-gaps, car drove fine, ...

Until my brother took place in the backseat and discovered an issue with the door not opening smoothly. 

I figured, fine, Tesla mobile service will have a breeze fixing this. Turned out the poor man struggled for 5-6 hours, only to make the issue worse. Now the window of that specific door had completely de-calibrated making use of that door a major pain in the ass. He advised me to make an appointment with the service center. With calling not being an option anymore and the Tesla-app not functioning for making appointments (!?), i manually drove there and had them schedule me ASAP, which was 2.5 weeks later.

So today, finally being able to bring my car to the center I was thinking: ‚Äúman, im gonna be glad to have that issue fixed by the end of the day. People are already making fun of my ‚Äòrather expensive‚Äô car.‚Äù

Got a call about 30 minutes ago stating the following: ‚Äú Hi, I would like to let you know that we‚Äôve discovered an issue with your ‚ÄòHigh-voltage system‚Äô (probably not the words he used, but im no tech guy and have absolutely no idea what he was on about). We‚Äôre gonna have to order parts to replace all of these which is gonna take a minimum of 3 days ( if available from TILBURG), otherwise it could take weeks if parts have to come from America.‚Äù  

Getting super nervous at this point, I asked the man on the phone if he was 100% sure this was about my car, as my problem was only related to a door. He confirmed and explained Tesla had ordered a recall of cars a while back that had this issue and apparently my car, which was delivered to me 1 month ago, is one of them.  The car drove fine, had no issues whatsoever apart from the door and now i get this news...

So here I am. No car with work tomorrow, super frustrated, no intel on a possible temporary replacement car til friday (they did not propose a temp car themselves, I had to ask specifically for one and they seemed hesitant) I mean, come on. I paid a premium ( belgian taxes!) to get this car and all I‚Äôve had since delivery, apart from the sweet driving experience overall, was issues. I expected minor issues with alignments / paint on delivery (which were none actually), but this seems to be a more fundamental thing that passed quality control. End of quarter deliveries i suppose?

TeslaMotors,frustrating,n15pyw,Supercharging credit not being applied by Tesla,"Hello all,

I bought my Tesla X in October of 2018. At that time, I was to receive an ANNUAL 400 kWh supercharging credit.

For 2 years, I received the supercharging, but this year it stopped. I contacted Tesla and waited many months for them to reply. Finally, they stated that I received the 400 kWh and I subsequently used the credits. I explained to them that this was an annual award, but I have not had a reply. I have documentation from my original sales person as well as from the website that this was to be an annual award.

This was on Tesla's site:

Please note that certain Model S and X, sold before November 2, 2018 receive 400 kWh (\~1,000 miles) of Supercharger credits annually. For usage above the complimentary credits provided, a small fee applies.

It is so frustrating not being able to talk to someone personally. The online chat is pretty worthless also as they they just forward my complaint. The Tesla service center is equally unproductive.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,m1nrk1,Why Tesla?,"A newbie questions so please bear with me.

I'm thinking of trading in my Porsche Cayenne to get a Tesla Model Y. I was just about to place an order and a friend who owns a Model 3 gave me a sense of some reality.

Even when we plan to drive like \~600 miles trip back and forth in a day, the charging overhead on Tesla is adding to 50% more on the travel time.

This in addition to the anxiety of using any additional power in the car for luxuries like AC / music and the fear of running out of charge or cutting close to dead batteries is very taxing per his experience.

This got me to re-think and looking for your suggestions, what is the reality of owning a Tesla? What kind of frustrations or anxieties do you face when on a road trip? How much extra time is added to your trip due to charging?

Please share your reality vs. the marketing brochure from Tesla.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,3v3or4,"This may be unpopular, but I really hate software 7.0","To be fair, I have a 70D without auto pilot software enabled.  For me, it has not done anything to improve the car and has in fact broken a number if things.  I am not a fan of the interface at all.  Too many features have been removed without gaining anything. I miss the speedometer, the date and time in the driver's display.  I have over 1/3 of that display showing me a picture of my car.  I bought the car....I know what it looks like.  On the 17inch screen, when I am navigating to a destination, it will no longer show the blue line indicating the route.  This is insanely frustrating. I only had the car about 2 months before 7.0 was released, but I miss 6.2 so much.  It was well thought out and designed and everything just worked.  I am aware auto pilot is revolutionary, but for those of us who don't have it, it just seems like the new software is change for the sake of change and ruined many things in the process.  

On another note, I live in Oregon and as we enter the rainy season these have to be the worst automatic windshield wipers.  They are so delayed in both settings, waiting for a solid layer if water to accumulate before activating.  It is actually a safety hazard.  

It is still an awesome car, its just disappointing that I no longer love driving it as much as I used to due to the poor software and driving in the rain - which in Oregon will be the next 6 months.

I dont buy it. He has to many things to deal with at the same time. Doesnt Tesla have a guy responsible for service? Does this guy actually do his job? What is the limiting factor here? Money? Staff?

There are things that are way more important than that. And at some point, if they dont solve the service/parts issues now and wait even longer, the situation will become extremely frustrating and messy up to the point where there is no point of return anymore.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,90vo3v,"The ""lot binning"" lie","The idea that some Model 3 motors had vastly higher quality than others never made any sense to me. After all, this would imply that there are dramatic variations between non-Performance Model 3s as well (it's very implausible that the quality variations would be bimodal, with a sharp and narrow peak defining regular engines and another sharp and narrow peak defining performance engines. It's much more likely that the power output distribution is roughly symmetric).

But I just realized that the EPA tests prove the much more common sensical explanation for why the performance model 3 is faster -- that the non-Performance is software limited in power output:

https://electrek.co/2018/07/17/tesla-model-3-dual-motor-performance-versions-official-epa-ratings/amp/

Notice that while the front units have the same 147 kW output between performance and non performance versions, the rear motors are different, but the performance version has the same power output as the RWD at 211 kW (!), which leaves only three interpretations: 

1. That all the RWD units produced during the last year had ""lot binned"" motors capable of producing 211 kW like the performance model read motors (implausible, since what would they have done with all the inferior engines?)

2. That Tesla is running all RWD engines at an unsustainably high power output because they're not lot binned (implausible, since why would they offer warranty if they did that?)

3. That all three models (RWD, AWD, P-AWD) have the same rear motors (which also is more plausible given that factory variations must be in the few-% range at most) and that the non-Performance AWD motor is simply lower in output because Tesla tuned the rear engine to be lower even than the identical motor on the RWD version.

I'd be curious to hear if you can find flaws in my reasoning. I personally find the identical 211 kW power output between RWD and P-AWD rear units too much of a coincidence to ignore. I love Tesla and will always support them, but I find the secrecy around hardware specs frustrating, and the EPA testing seems to fill in the gaps Elon is leaving with his tweets.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/90vo3v/the_lot_binning_lie/,jintoku,3616.0,0.5502
TeslaMotors,frustrating,nohr0l,Food for thought on no radar autopilot,"TL;DR Tesla might have made the right decision with Tesla Vision. 

Been seeing all of the posts about no radar autopilot and wanted to share some thoughts. 

It seems the mysterious part that was holding up tens of thousands of 3s and Ys was the radar (no confirmation but this is my assumption). I‚Äôve heard other OEMs are having similar shortages and can‚Äôt produce cars with ADAS. 

If this assumption is correct, Tesla had a few choices 

‚Ä¢ Continue to let tens of thousands (maybe more depending on the severity of the radar shortage) of cars pile up. A logistical and financial nightmare. 

‚Ä¢ Deliver the cars without radar and promise to install at service center (service centers are already overwhelmed and removing bumper + installing radar isn‚Äôt the easiest job, especially if it‚Äôs needed on 10+ thousand cars). 

‚Ä¢ Deliver the cars without autopilot, this would suck for everyone since it‚Äôs a major selling point. 

‚Ä¢ Deliver all of the cars and release the vision only autopilot that is still a work in progress a few months early, and over the coming months bring it closer to parity through OTA updates, especially with the massive increase in data of its usage. 

Despite it sucking to take delivery of such an advanced car with temporary limitations, when I see all of these options I have to say I think I agree with Tesla‚Äôs decision. If this was the case maybe they could have admitted  there was a shortage leading to the decision but not sure that would be the best decision either from a marketing/pr perspective. 

Now‚Ä¶ if this decision wasn‚Äôt motivated by a radar parts shortage, then we have a decent problem. Tesla has been known to do radical stuff and then go back on it (closing all their stores, accepting Bitcoin, etc) so I wouldn‚Äôt put it past them. I‚Äôd be really disappointed if this was the case and people should be frustrated if so. Doing radical things like this just because Elon believes in vision only and has unrealistic timelines for feature parity with radar would piss me off if I just spent 60k on a car.

But, if it is the parts shortage, I would say we should be thankful that Tesla Vision is an option for Tesla to continue to deliver Autopilot in some capacity and I can‚Äôt imagine it won‚Äôt improve significantly over the current functionality over the coming months. If the alternative is no autopilot or no Tesla, I‚Äôll take Tesla Vision any day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/nohr0l/food_for_thought_on_no_radar_autopilot/,smokingthesemeats41,856.0,0.9587

TeslaMotors,frustrating,6wiib8,Our Tesla Experience - LONG!,"My husband ( /u/alexp2 ) and I decided to hire a Tesla Model S as a treat for our wedding anniversary, and I thought I'd share our experience here as it was our first time with a Tesla.

As a bit of background, we are big Tesla fans but until recently didn't have anywhere to charge an EV.  As we now live in a house with driveway we plan for an EV to be our next car, and have a Model 3 reservation.  We decided to hire a Model S to experience EV driving and see if the Model S might be a nice fit for us instead.

We hired the car (a post-factlift 90D with AP1) from a company called [Whitecar](https://white.car) and had the car from Tuesday into Wednesday, which was a one-day (24hr) rental.  The manager at Whitecar offered to extend our trip in the morning, so we had the car for a little over 24 hours.

**Our Route**

We planned the route in advance to maximise driving time on different roads.  We left Whitecar in Edinburgh and travelled to down the A68 to Newcastle for lunch, then along the A69 to join the M6 for our return journey to Scotland.  That evening we travelled up to Dundee with a friend to let her experience a ride the car before coming home.  The following day we stayed local and let our parents experience the Tesla.

**First Impressions**

Nothing can describe the eerie feeling of silently pulling off in an EV for the first time.  It's incredible.  Swearing followed by euphoric giggling is the general sound of putting your foot down for the first time in a Tesla Model S, something we experienced personally and then with every passenger we took for a spin.

The car was comfortable and very well thought out.  We're big tech fans and always like to option the gadgets in our cars.  The Model S has plenty of them - the only things that are missing from our current car are ventilated seats and 360¬∫ top-down cameras.  This would have come in very handy when parking this behemoth in the woefully inadequate spaces at the Metrocentre in Newcastle - I know about Autopark, but with a stream of traffic behind me I couldn't get the icon to appear.

The voice control worked flawlessly for calling and navigation.  Locations that our own car (2016 Kia Optima 3) simply doesn't know about were found effortlessly by voice.  Having multiple driver profiles is excellent, especially as they include mirrors and steering wheel position (our Optima only controls the seat, and is limited to two profiles).

I love that my phone connected so quickly to Bluetooth, and that the car remembered that I was listening to BT rather than the radio.  On my Optima it defaults to radio every time you turn the car on.  The Tesla started music as soon as I opened the door, which felt like magic!  Having the music continue once the car is in park, and lower the volume when you open the door, is a very nice touch.

Being able to sit in the car with the AC on and not look like a dick is a huge benefit, along with the pre-cooling.  I hate sitting in my own car while waiting on someone and boiling as I don't want to sit in a car park with a big dirty diesel engine running.

**Charging / Range anxiety**

With the 90D charged to 90% when we picked it up, we were able to drive to Newcastle and then on to the supercharger at Gretna services with 16% remaining in the battery.  That was a total distance of 176 miles, but I'd be lying if I said I was driving optimally...

At Gretna we charged for a while while having a coffee, then continued to Abington supercharger where we had dinner and charged back up to 90%.  This gave us plenty of range to the Dundee supercharger via our friend's flat.  We had a coffee and some nibbles at the Hilton in Dundee (with a 10% Tesla discount) and then headed home to Falkirk.

We did charge at home using a standard wall socket, and this gave us around 20% range in 7 hours.  Faster than I expected.

Because we didn't have a charger at home I was more anxious to keep the car charged as much as possible, though of course when we own a car this anxiety will disappear as we'll easily charge overnight.  It certainly didn't feel like a chore, and we never had an issue getting a charge.  In fact we only saw one other car the whole day at a Supercharger.

**Autopilot**

This worked very well on motorways, and was outstanding in slow start-stop traffic around the Edinburgh City Bypass.  Our Optima has radar cruise control and lane keep assist.  The lane keep assist is basically useless, and the radar cruise control is markedly worse than that of AP.

In start-stop traffic, our own car will come to a stop quite abruptly, then when traffic moves away ahead it will roar off to catch up, then slam on the brakes again.  It works, but lacks any refinement to the point that I don't use it for fear of pissing off people behind me.

In contrast, AP worked smoothly and subtly, seeming to anticipate what had to happen like a real driver would.  Excellent!

On motorways it worked flawlessly too - no complaints at all.  Even on well-marked A-roads it was good, though I didn't try it on the roads that were twisty.

I did eventually manage to try Autopark in a quiet little car park.  It seemed slow to find the spaces, but it did park well.  I'm not sure how useful it would be in real life as in a busy car park I don't think I'd have time to let it figure out where the spaces are.  It felt like driving past them the icon would appear briefly and then go away again.  Frustrating, but I've heard Autopark in AP2 is better?

**The bad bits**

The car we hired had a sunroof and this had an annoying rattle while driving.  A few interior panels were a bit misaligned and wobbly, indicating substandard build-quality even compared to our Optima.  The chrome trim at the bottom of the front and rear door windows didn't line up either.

Navigation appears to be standard in-car navigation masquerading as Google Maps.  The maps look like Google, but the navigation information definitely is not, and doesn't appear to be much better than our own car.  It must use Google POI search, however, as this is excellent.

The map also had incorrect supercharger usage information.  Every single time it told us there were more people charging than there were.  At Dundee it says 4/8 bays were free, but nobody was there at all.  At Edinburgh it said both bays were in use, but one of them was free.

Storage in the rear was a big problem.  I don't even care much for proper storage, but there weren't even cupholders!  What the hell?

**Kerb-appeal**

I've never driven a car before that turns heads as much as this.  We saw not-so-subtle glances from other drivers, as well as a couple of groups of teens who got super excited, pointing and jumping around when we drove by.  That was unexpected, but kind of cool!  I also enjoyed the camaraderie when another Model S driver gave me a friendly flash when he passed in the opposite direction... though I felt like a complete fraud!

**Conclusions**

We need one of these damn cars!  Our lease isn't up until 2019, but at that point we will be looking at a Tesla for sure.  We have a Model 3 reservation, but I think we're going to stretch to a Model S if we can - I've already got my eye on a 75D with blue paint, cream interior, and EAP.  If we go for a Model 3 it'll be the long range version with PUP, EAP and red paint.

Sorry for the long post, but we had a wonderful couple of days and I just had to share it.  Happy to answer any questions from non-owners or clarify any aspects of our experience.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/6wiib8/our_tesla_experience_long/,dst87,20378.0,0.9951
TeslaMotors,frustrating,a33vpj,[Discussion] Interesting claims made on my Model 3 test drive that your Tesla will one day use autopilot to earn money for you by driving passengers for a fee. Is this really a viable option?,"I test drove a model 3 with the performance package in NYC last weekend. First time driving a Tesla... I'm absolutely hooked. More than a little frustrated that I have to move out of the city before it's going to be worth purchasing one.

While on the test drive my sales guy was young and energetic and made a few comments that I found surprising. First, he said that one day your Tesla would conduct rides (like an Uber/Lyft/Juno, etc.) while you weren't using your car. That the Tesla would be able to make money for you. Is this something that has been discussed or published before?

Also, I asked a few questions about the Tesla ecosystem. My dream would be to have a home with the Tesla Roof and two Powerwalls to run my house and, ultimately, drive the car on 100% renewable energy. Interestingly, he told me the Powerwall would not be a good way of charging the vehicle and that it would not work well due to voltage. Is this right?

TeslaMotors,frustrating,fw9uly,Model Y appears to be susceptible to rock chip damage the same way as the Model 3,"https://imgur.com/a/QbinD83

I got my Y on day 1 in San Diego and it was raining for several days after delivery. I drove it home in the rain and went through a section of freeway where I heard a ton of tiny rocks getting thrown up at the bottom of the car but didn‚Äôt think too much of it. After a week or so the rain stopped and I had an opportunity to finally wash the car even though I had a paint protection appointment scheduled a few days later. While washing, I noticed some roughness on the rear doors that I was hoping the detail shop could handle and I just put it out of my mind. 

After having paint correction and protection done I was shown the damage to the doors and realized the chips and gone through the clear and the paint. I was pretty gutted after having just paid $75k for a car that in less than 400 miles I already needed to repaint both rear doors. 

I reached out to Tesla and through a series of conversations they informed me that there is nothing Service can do, and this query needed to go back to Delivery. Delivery obviously wasn‚Äôt able to help with damage that happened post-delivery and sent me back to Service. Service asked to evaluate the car to see if they could help me ‚Äúbuild a story‚Äù to get some help from Tesla with repair so I dropped the car off for an hour and got the call to come back. Service told me there was nothing they could do since they don‚Äôt warranty against road damage. This was obviously disappointing but was also frustrating because I felt I had made it clear from day one this was a post-delivery issue and they had just gotten my hopes up and then wasted my time. When I got home I discovered that in addition to ‚Äúevaluating‚Äù they also tried sanding the damage away, realized it wasn‚Äôt going away, and released the vehicle back to me. They didn‚Äôt even buff the sand marks away, but they never asked for or received permission to do this since I had already gotten ceramic coating on the doors and never would have let them try that. So I had to contact Service again (obviously my frustration was growing at this point) and show them what they did and ask for an explanation. They quickly dodged that and asked if they could dispatch their own detailer to correct the paint. I highlighted again the ceramic coating (CQuartz Finest Reserve) and said not to deploy a detailer without the ability to reapply that since they‚Äôd be buffing a large majority of the door. Obviously because my luck is what it is, the detailer showed up without the ability to reapply this, but assured me he would not have sanded the door had he known that the paint had been protected. He actually was pretty cool. He buffed the sanding out and said he‚Äôs contact me within a couple days to schedule coming again to reapply the ceramic coating. I told him to make sure we schedule this as I was now at a point where am considering filing an insurance claim to respray the doors and then getting STEK PPF on them to match the front half of the car, the rear bumper, and the lower half of the rear hatch. He said if I went that route to let him know so he could instead come and do a full wash of the car instead I‚Äôm an effort to make up for the drama. Pretty classy guy in my opinion..

I believe the lack of any kind of weather guard behind the front wheel well is the reason this road debris was able to cause so much damage, And I also question if there was enough clear coat and enough paint applied and also if the paint had enough time to actually cure before delivery.  Unfortunately the plastic trim under the door is also damaged and no amount of paint or clear coat or PPF will protect that, so that piece is just doomed over time. I wanted to share this experience not to put Tesla on blast (I love this car!! And my delivery experience was fantastic) but  primarily to alert other Y owners to just be aware, and also to say that if you‚Äôre considering a partial PPF on the Y at all, you may want to at least include the rear doors if not all four.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/fw9uly/model_y_appears_to_be_susceptible_to_rock_chip/,damightyj,3103.0,0.9814

About a month ago i called and made an appointment for tomorrow to test drive a Model 3.

This sucks, especially since he straight up told me that 6 months from now isn't important enough. What sucks more though is that they call less than 24h in advance. I've already moved other appointments and even asked HR to leave early.

Called Tesla roadside assistance and for the past 20 mins on hold with no one answering the phone. Just music playing. Have a infant in the car. Stuck in the middle land of a very busy 5 lane road. Any other numbers to reach for emergency assistance? Not sure what else to do.

Thanks.

UPDATE:

Thanks everyone for help.
 
- Called 911. Cops are here to help guide the traffic.
- Called AAA and flatbed will be here in an hour. 
- Finally got hold of Tesla after 30 mins, recommend that car need to be towed to Ohio (we are in Michigan with no service center).
- Car message now changed to ‚Äúcannot maintain vehicle power‚Äù. I thin 12V is dying. I have the car in ‚ÄúTransport mode‚Äù but flat bed is not here yet. 

Will keep updating.

ADDITIONAL UPDATE:
- We were able to get the car towed to our home and had family member drive us home. The 12V did not die on us and we were able to engage ‚Äútransport mode‚Äù to get the the car on the flat bed and again while getting the car off the flat bed at our home.
- Since initial contract, Tesla has consistently followed up with updates. They have arranged for the car to be towed to the a service center in Ohio tomorrow and will have it looked at on Monday. We also have model S so we are good for now. 

I appreciate everyone‚Äôs help. Overall, the experience was not too bad other than the fact that we had to substitute our planned Saturday night dinner with late night Taco Bell. The cop who came to help out was super friendly and wanted to know how to put Tesla in tow mode (he said he knew Tesla‚Äôs are different:)). While waiting for the tow truck, I was able read the manual on how to put the car in ‚ÄúTransport mode‚Äù and how to jump start the 12 V battery in case it died before tow truck came. Luckily, this was not necessary.

Initial post was purely out of desperation/frustration while waiting to get through Tesla roadside assistance for 30 mins (and the fact that we were really hungry- we were going out for dinner when this happened).

I will update this thread one last time when the car is fixed and find out what the problem was. Ours is relatively new car delivered about 4 weeks ago with VIN in 50000s.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9g6gna/need_help_urgent/,longaadoc,3005.0,0.988

TeslaMotors,frustrating,8xcnwe,[Discussion] Analysis Paralysis on AWD Info + Delivery Time,"I got my invite with everyone else on the 27th (after being a day one reservation holder this kinda miffed me) but have been waiting on information about the actual performance of the AWD (non-P) model.  The improved acceleration/traction and *potential* for greater range seem like a no-brainer for $4000 on top of a $55k car. 

But!  Nobody (not under NDA at least) has actually seen or driven an AWD 3.  It might actually be better than claimed (hoping the 4.5 is conservative like the 5.1 is on RWD) or it might be something where Tesla is working to not cannibalize S+X sales.  We just don't know until people get their cars, and I worry by *that* point the backlog may push deliveries into Q1 of '19.

Which brings me to the next point.  It seems like some people are seeing 3-5 months quoted for delivery but instead getting their VINs right away and cars delivered in days and weeks instead of months.  After waiting for over 2 years I'd rather have a car in 2 weeks than 5 months.  But it sounds like there was a buildup of cars that all got delivered and now there may be a backlog of months again. 

I guess my frustration boils down to not knowing anything about the AWD outside of what's on the Tesla website.  I'd hate to buy a RWD now and feel buyer's remorse in 2 months when it's delivered a week before AWD cars that could potentially be worth the $4000.  But I'd also hate to wait 2 months, order whatever car I want based on knowing what the AWD is like, then miss the credit and/or have my delivery delayed for months. 

Anyone else in the same situation?  I love and believe in Tesla but this will be almost a year's salary for a car that I haven't even seen yet so I'm on the fence and really want to know all about the AWD TM3 before I commit to it.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,ecmwut,Autosteer speed limited to only 5 mph over limit,"Autosteer speed being limited to only 5 MPH above the speed limit seems silly in areas like Michigan, where you don‚Äôt get pulled over unless you‚Äôre going more than 10 mph above speed limit. E.g. if speed limit is 40 mph, autosteer will limit my speed to 45 mph and a train of cars will form behind me unless I manually speed up to 49-50 mph (which makes ACC useless, unless I disengage autosteer). Because of this, I don‚Äôt use autosteer for around 75% of my daily commute. Anyone else frustrated with this? Aside from this, am absolutely loving my model 3.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,a0g1n0,"My Experience of my Model 3 breaking down 450 miles from home, and come home to find the X having issues","My wife and I had gone up from Socal to Norcal to visit family for the Holidays. On Thanksgiving, my Model 3 was unable to start after supercharging. After disconnecting the charger cable and getting back in the car it was unable to get to get into drive mode. 3 errors came up on the screen: ""Power reduced Exit and re-enter car - may restore operation"" ""car shutting down PULL OVER SAFELY"" ""Unable to Drive PULL OVER SAFELY."" I was parked at a supercharger and tried to power off car, reset computer by holding both steering wheel knobs but same message came up. Called Tesla service and they attempted to troubleshoot but they said it needed to be towed out. Car had been working without issues for over the past 8000 miles. Initially the first week after ownership the car had another error and required a pyrofuse and drive unit replacement but it was fixed quickly and had been working fine since. Came to bay area to visit family and this should have been the least of our worries.

Luckily I was near my wife's families home and they were able to pick us up. Tesla's service told me that I did not have to stick around and they would tow it to nearest service center. Since it was Thanksgiving I was unable to get a loaner that day and was told to call the service center in the morning. I had called the next morning and they told me to come to the service center to get a loaner but they did not have any info about my Model 3. I was told that since I would not be able to return to norcal anytime soon that they would have to ship the car down to me if it was not fixed by the time I left. Hard part is that it was a big blow to my confidence in reliability of Tesla's, esp being over 400 miles away from home. I have an X that was just recently picked up from the shop and now 2 major incidents on the 3. My BMW 435i has gone 65k miles with 0 incidents. We also have had 2 i3 leases with 0 incidents.  Old Lexus ran 250k miles with minimal maintenance, my dream is for Tesla to catch up to this type of reliability. Worst thing from this entire situation is that some friends/family believe the negative news stories and don't believe in EVs and are all in for gas and now they have seen first hand of our Tesla needing work. I still love my Teslas and would pick them because of the safety in having the lowest probability of injury in the event of an accident but wish reliability was much better.

I still had not received any update info about my car up to today. Stopped by the service center yesterday around 5:40pm but service was closed and nobody was available who could help or give status update about what was going on with my car. I had to get back home today because I work tomorrow and had no choice but to take the loaner all the way back home. Luckily it was an autopilot enabled S but the 75 kw battery made charging stops longer than it would have been in my 3. I get home today and learn the Model X has a error ""Limited A/C and battery cooling - Contact Tesla Service."" The X was just picked up for repairs 2 weeks ago for yellow screen, window squeak, misaligned door which I had delayed to get fixed since delivery but the car has always been driving fine. Since tomorrow is first full weekday business day I hope I get more concrete answers about my Model 3 and what has been happening. I would discourage anyone who is trying to stretch their budget to get in a Tesla as there are hardships and other unexpected costs involved when purchasing these luxury vehicles as is the same with buying other luxury cars like BMW, Mercedes, Audi etc. If you were going to buy a luxury car to begin with than the Tesla will save money, but don't think that long term operating costs will beat a Accord/Civic or reliable used car. Its frustrating having 2 Tesla's and both having issues at the same time, but I am still a believer in Tesla and their mission and they have been a blast to drive when working and autopilot has exceeded our expectations and made commuting much easier. Tesla is here to stay, did not post this experience for shorts to have a field day because I would not trade in the Tesla for any BMW, Audi or Mercedes because they simply don't impress me and feel archaic next to a Tesla. All cars can breakdown but Tesla can learn and continue to improve. There are tons more positive owner stories but to create a balanced community we need to address the negatives too so that further improvements can be made. I am currently enjoying having a new S while I wait for my car to get back home to me.

TLDR: Model 3 broke down 450 miles from home on Thanksgiving. Still don't know what happened to the car and have not had any contact from Tesla. Had to bring the loaner back home and expecting Tesla to ship my car back to me when fixed. Get home and X also has error telling me to contact Tesla Service. Teslas are safe, but cannot call them reliable. Embarrassing having the car break down in front of others who are all in for oil and don't trust EVs. Teslas are still the future, and absolutely love the cars for their tech, fun factor, crash testing safety but communication and reliability have room for improvement.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/a0g1n0/my_experience_of_my_model_3_breaking_down_450/,Turtlesz,10568.0,0.9903
TeslaMotors,frustrating,jyis6s,"So, I bought the Model 3 SR+ Hansshow Version E Premium Audio upgrade and installed it. Here‚Äôs what I learned:","I have a June 2020 Model 3 SR+. They don‚Äôt include the rear deck surround speakers from the factory, older models do.

I‚Äôve never done any vehicle wiring before, so it was a learning experience and took me much longer than it probably should have (roughly 13 hours in total). I have experience with putting together computers and other electronics, so I figured it wouldn‚Äôt be too difficult/that it wouldn‚Äôt take me very long. (I was very wrong)

Here‚Äôs what I learned:

If you don‚Äôt have experience working on car audio systems or you don‚Äôt have endless time and patience to figure out the somewhat frustrating instructions, you should hire a professional to install it for you. 

If you do want to go ahead with the install yourself, here are some things to keep in mind:

A. Make sure you have the right tools for this. Car panel pry tools, different sized wrenches, hex keys, various sized screw drivers, zip ties for cable management, and a windows laptop. Keep all of different screws and pins that you remove organized in a safe place so that you know which ones go where when putting everything back together again.

B. You have to shut down the car and disconnect both the 12V battery as well as the main battery connection under the rear seats. Make sure to leave all the doors, trunk & frunk, and windows open before you disconnect the 12V battery. If you accidentally close/close your frunk while the 12V battery is disconnect and all of your doors are closed, you‚Äôre in big trouble and might need tesla service to come tow your vehicle to open up your frunk again because that‚Äôs where the 12V is, and nothing in the car can work without it. I accidentally locked my frunk once while the 12V was disconnected and had to jump start the frunk lock through the wires in the tow hitch port at the front of the car. I used a 12V signal from another vehicle to do this. If the car is locked and the doors are closed, that unfortunately won‚Äôt work (so that people can‚Äôt steal things from your frunk).

C. You have to run cables under the carpets of the front two seats. It helps to have long arms to push the cable from one end of the carpet to the other, as you can‚Äôt fully remove them if you don‚Äôt want to glue them back to the car later.

D. The Hansshow video guides for install process are currently out of date and for an older design of their speaker upgrade. Some parts are still relevant and the same, others very much are not. The only piece of information that Hansshow currently has for the new versions are PDFs with pretty low quality images and little explanations. I had to go back and forth between the old videos and the PDF to figure out how to remove certain panels and where to route the wires underneath them. That is why the install took me so much longer than it should have. 

That being said, Hansshow was quite helpful when I spoke with them directly over WhatsApp and asked them loads of questions while I was installing it. They‚Äôre based in China, and seemed to be online from around 6PM PST. This was essential for figuring out a few things that were not detailed in their install guides.

E. Their sound system now takes power and ground from under the rear seats. They tell you to connect the ground wire to part of the car that uses a tesla specific/proprietary nut. I didn‚Äôt have the tool to unscrew it, so I had to connect ground elsewhere.

F. The guide does a quite poor job at explaining where to mount the DSP. I ended up texting them on WhatsApp and they showed me where to mount it. It goes in the gap under the center console, where they also tell you to route the wires through to the driver side of the car. I can‚Äôt attach an image to Reddit, but you‚Äôll know what I‚Äôm talking about if you do the installation. They also include two small double sided adhesive pads to secure the DSP to the car. I ended up using some of my own 3M tape as well because I didn‚Äôt feel like the DSP was secure enough with only the two included pads.

G. Removing the panels often feels like you‚Äôre going to break the connectors when pulling it off. Some do take quite a bit of force to remove. Just take your time and cross your fingers that nothing breaks when you pull them off. I managed to do everything without breaking something. (surprisingly)

H. Once you have everything wired up, reconnect the power to your car and test the sound to make sure all of the speakers are working before you put all the trim panels back on, you don‚Äôt want to have to take them off again if something isn‚Äôt working properly.

I. I found that the cable to connect the rear deck surround speakers isn‚Äôt long enough to actually reach them to the Hansshow DSP under the middle console at the front of the car. They are simple red and black cables, so it wasn‚Äôt hard for me to just cut the connector ends off and extent them by another meter. This only applies if your Model 3 does not include the surround speakers from the factory, since Tesla‚Äôs wiring for them is not there either.

J. When installing the subwoofer, don‚Äôt mount it until you have it wired up and tested it to make sure it‚Äôs working. I also recommend tweaking the settings on it a bit to increase the bass that it outputs. It would be very difficult to do that once it‚Äôs mounted. When mounting it, make sure to really crank the screws down hard, it‚Äôll work better and you really don‚Äôt want the vibrations from it to loosen the screws over time.

K. Make sure to plug in your laptop to the DSP once everything is connected and powered up, and install the Hansshow custom settings on it. That‚Äôs the key step in making everything balanced and sound the way it should. Here‚Äôs where you can find their DSP software and custome profile: [Github Link](https://github.com/Hansshow/Model-3-Audio-Verision-E-DSP-software)
My laptop really did not like their software and told me it‚Äôs a malware/trojan virus, so just beware. I doubt it really is, but anything is possible. My laptop isn‚Äôt my main computer so I just said screw it and turned off my antivirus to open the program quickly and do the software install. 

L. Lastly, here are some helpful videos and links that I refrenced throughout the installation:

Now you may be wondering, was it worth it?

First, the bad:
My only really complaint after installation is that left/right, front/back is now reversed in the sound balance settings, and the chimes for everything are painfully loud, but I discovered that turning on Joe Mode brought them back down to basically stock loudness. Installation was difficult, but it was never going to be easy anyways.

The good:
If you want your car to sound as good as possible, yes, it is 100% worth it. It makes quite a difference to me personally, but I also love a great sound system. Everything sounds much more full and complete, and the added subwoofer adds some good punch to whatever you‚Äôre listening too. The audio experience in the back seats is a LOT better now too with the addition of the rear deck surround speakers. It truly feels like surround sound now because audio isn‚Äôt just coming from the front sound bar.

Overall, I‚Äôm glad that I did this upgrade. I wish the Hansshow installation guides were actually up to date and more clear, but I imagine Hansshow will update their videos for it at some point.

That‚Äôs basically everything I could think of to meantion. Hopefully this was helpful to anyone considering buying this product or about to install it themselves.

[Tesla Model 3 LR AWD and Cross Country Road Trip \(2800+ miles, 12 states, 30 Superchargers\)](https://preview.redd.it/1g2l19xyb5z51.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=13abd60beebc9667a41cf6ade1a7e27eeb32a882)

After completing a [cross-country road trip](https://startupsidekick.com/roadtrip/) in my two-year old Tesla Model 3, I fell in love with it all over again and knew I had to write a post about it.

In my opinion, Tesla hasn‚Äôt just revolutionized the electrical vehicle (EV) industry, it has reinvented the car, as I will show you in this (highly biased) post.¬†

Whether you‚Äôre in the market for a Tesla, are an existing owner or are simply curious about EVs, I hope you‚Äôll get some value from this post.

*You‚Äôll see why comparing a Tesla to most cars today is like comparing a smartphone to a flip phone ‚Äî it‚Äôs really that big of a difference.*

If you don‚Äôt know much about how EVs work, I highly recommend watching this popular 10-minute YouTube video titled [How does an Electric Car work?](https://youtu.be/3SAxXUIre28) ‚Äî it‚Äôs a bit technical but overall worth a one-time watch to understand why EVs are the future. It‚Äôs no surprise the [EV market is expected to reach over $800 billion by 2027](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/06/08/2045017/0/en/Electric-Vehicle-Market-to-Reach-802-81-Billion-Globally-by-2027-Allied-Market-Research.html)!¬†

In this post, we‚Äôll take a tour of the following aspects of a Tesla Model 3:

1. App
2. Exterior
3. Interior
4. Driving
5. Charging
6. Safety
7. Maintenance
8. Community
9. Cost
10. Improvements

Here we go.

# 1. App

Before describing the car itself, I want to begin with one of the most convenient aspects of owning a Tesla: the [Tesla mobile app](https://www.tesla.com/support/tesla-app). This serves as your primary car key and provides many remote control features.

The mobile app automatically unlocks and locks the Tesla 3 doors using bluetooth ‚Äî this short-distance, keyless access is extremely convenient because it‚Äôs hands-free (e.g. phone in pocket) and eliminates having to carry a physical car key.

Tesla does provide key FOBs but in the two years of owning my car, I‚Äôve only used them for valet parking or as a backup in my wallet, in case my phone dies.¬†

[Tesla Mobile App](https://preview.redd.it/kfttx215c5z51.png?width=1660&format=png&auto=webp&s=baf0fe3485fc47786c9451b54c77971473121d4a)

The Tesla mobile app complements the interior touchscreen by giving you many controls outside the car.¬†

The long list of remote control features include lock/unlock doors/trunks, turning on the climate, control charging, valet mode, honk/flash to locate the car, set speed limit‚Ä¶and more.

You can even use the Summon feature to slowly drive the car in reverse or forward ‚Äî think remote control toy cars ‚Äî this can come in handy for water puddles or tight garages.

Other neat features include the ability to send an address to your car from maps apps such as Apple and Google Maps (via the share option). You can even locate where your car is parked using the app.

These types of pragmatic, modern day tech features is what sets Tesla apart from all other car manufacturers.

# 2. Exterior¬†

The Tesla 3 is a sleek looking four door sedan, which drives like an expensive sports car.

[Tesla Model 3 - Exterior, \\""Frunk\\"" and Trunk](https://preview.redd.it/uy7iz358c5z51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=5da5efb1ea1881018099bcfcef0691bfb566febc)

The doors have unique flush handles that are aerodynamically designed to reduce drag. You‚Äôll have to get used to giving one time instructions to first time users, such as ‚Äúpush the fat then pull the skinny.‚Äú

Tesla 3 comes with two trunks, a conventional rear trunk and an innovative, front trunk (‚Äúfrunk‚Äù).¬†

I find the frunk extremely useful for small bags (e.g. groceries), since the incline keeps the bags from sliding around. I used to get strange looks when I opened the frunk but people seem to be getting used to it, thanks to a growing number of Teslas on the road.

The rear trunk also has lots of room with an additional compartment under the trunk‚Äôs floor. You can also fold the rear seats down for longer objects (e.g. skis); I was able to fit a hybrid bicycle in there once.

# 3. Interior

When people get inside a Tesla 3 for the first time, they are often taken aback by how bare the interior is.¬†

Then‚Ä¶they slowly begin to get wowed by how many features are packed in the deceptively minimalistic interior.

The Tesla 3 can comfortably seat five people, with heating in all seats. It has more legroom than conventional, internal combustion engine (gasoline) cars, since there‚Äôs no transmission hump in EVs.

[Tesla Model 3 Minimalist Interior](https://preview.redd.it/53ivrykfc5z51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=be5d5c353bd3c02357834b595257dcd53f553815)

With the rear seats folded down, there‚Äôs enough space to fit a twin size airbed ‚Äî I have read about people sleeping overnight in their Teslas, at campgrounds.

The Tesla 3 has your basics: seats, air vents, several cup holders, multiple storage compartments, USB and 12v chargers, door locks, and window controls (auto retract for all four windows).¬†

At the center of the front panel is a single, gorgeous 15-inch, extremely responsive, touchscreen to operate everything else (including the glovebox) ‚Äî essentially your control center.

[Touchscreen](https://preview.redd.it/ibtj0iekc5z51.png?width=673&format=png&auto=webp&s=c284c34457d8f3273f71885e01084cc3be9e06cb)

Getting used to having everything on a single screen takes only minutes to get comfortable with, since most of us use mobile devices these days, so it‚Äôs a familiar feel.

I‚Äôve personally fallen in love with the single touchscreen concept, since it feels like using a tablet (e.g. iPad) and gives the car a more airy feel, without the clutter of knobs you find in most cars.

It‚Äôs baffling to me that other car manufacturers haven‚Äôt realized the simple fact that consumers love their smartphones, since most cars still have a fragmented instrumentation dashboard.

Apple CarPlay and Android Auto support helps but it still doesn‚Äôt provide an integrated, smartphone-like, user experience (Ux) ‚Äî imagine if you had part knobs and part touchscreen to operate your smartphone!¬†

[Settings](https://preview.redd.it/5yxbf7rmc5z51.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed3101efca451a127a8d83b45ae4f68f5cefadcd)

The 15-inch touchscreen provides you access to many features, almost too many to cover in detail in this post, so I‚Äôll list them instead:

* Speedometer
* Door lock/unlock
* Settings (glovebox, lights, locks, display, driving, Full Self-Driving (FSD)/Autopilot, navigation, safety, service, software, etc.)
* Climate control
* Wiper control
* Backup camera
* Navigation: Everything you can expect from a mapping app, with comprehensive supercharger network support built in. The satellite view is amazingly responsive!
* Battery level, settings and consumption
* USB connectivity/charging and 12V charging
* Objects nearby (cars, trucks, motorcycles, signs, people, traffic lights, lane markings)
* Dashcam ‚Äì record video footage on a USB drive using Tesla‚Äôs external cameras (see video at the end of this post)
* Custom driver profiles
* Manual/automatic garage opener via HomeLink
* Sentry alarm system
* Tire pressure
* Incoming phone calls
* Seat belt warnings

[Netflix - Full Screen](https://preview.redd.it/2jxkzv8pc5z51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=9735ace7db3cecf11e10ee0c030abea234259b2f)

Then‚Ä¶there‚Äôs a whole section on the screen dedicated to apps, including:¬†

* Web browser
* Calendar (integrated with your phone with auto navigation)¬†
* Entertainment (with full-screen support) including Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, Caraoke (with a ‚ÄúC‚Äù), Atari arcade games, drawing tool, fullscreen campfire, and more.

With so many entertainment options, you will have to find reasons to get bored on supercharger stops.¬†

The Tesla air vents provide ample control via the touchscreen, with some very cool graphics to change the airflow direction, by ‚Äúpinching‚Äù the air animation.

[Climate Control](https://preview.redd.it/8v70m6xrc5z51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=74ee23270b9d3ce10af672b4cb13e64ebeee008e)

The steering wheel comes with scrolling wheels that serve multiple purposes, for example controlling the music volume/track, cruise speed, side mirrors, steering column tilt, and soft/hard rebooting the car. It also has a built in sensor to detect whether your hands are on the steering wheel during FSD (see below).

[Steering Wheel Controls](https://preview.redd.it/pijsznytc5z51.png?width=451&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcbdaeb8125fdf59f47d5b331ac48f1aac962194)

Of course, you get all of the above‚Ä¶.under a wondrous, panoramic, tinted glass roof that inspires you to daydream in the daytime and stargaze at night.

[Tesla Model 3 - Glass Roof](https://preview.redd.it/3n14ifzwc5z51.png?width=4160&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a47455a716959f4debbae87e16c4df805178f7b)

# 4. Driving

The Model 3 is extremely quiet, fun to drive, nimble on turns, and accelerates fast enough to make people‚Äôs heartthrob and say ‚Äúwow!‚Äù¬†

Imagine having the acceleration of an expensive sports car with the feel of a golf cart ‚Äî that‚Äôs what driving a Tesla feels like.

As of November 2020, here were the 0 to 60 MPH speeds for the three Tesla 3 models (with the ability to go faster via a paid upgrade):

* Standard Range Plus: 5.3s 0-60 MPH, Top speed 140 MPH
* Long Range AWD (my car): 4.2s 0-60 MPH, Top speed 145 MPH
* Performance: 3.1s 0-60 MPH, Top speed 162 MPH

To begin driving a Tesla 3, you turn it on by putting your foot on the brake pedal and turn it off by putting the car in park ‚Äî there‚Äôs no ‚Äúcranking‚Äù the car on or shifting the gear in park and pressing a STOP button ‚Äî it‚Äôs essentially like turning your smartphone on and off.¬†

Sometimes at a complete stop in my garage or parking spot, I‚Äôll forget to put my car in park before opening the door ‚Äî but no worries, the car automatically puts it in park for you.

Tesla also automatically engages the emergency brakes, when you park your car. It‚Äôs these little conveniences that Tesla has thought of, which make the Tesla so much fun to own.

While parking/reversing (e.g. in a tight garage), it helps to see a readout of exact measurement, and audio/visual warnings, for objects close by.

[Tesla Nearby Objects Warning and Backup Camera](https://preview.redd.it/uelevt60d5z51.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb07a01e970636e0d8196606c2ab42867a860aaa)

When you first use the accelerator pedal on a Tesla 3, it feels like you‚Äôre pressing against pure air since it‚Äôs so quiet but the highly responsive, induction motor makes it a lot of fun to go from 0 to 60 MPH (4.4s in my car)!

I absolutely love how quiet my Tesla drives. EVs in general are very quiet under 30 MPH, in fact so quiet that many countries will soon require sound emitters in EVs, for pedestrian and bicyclist safety.¬†

Though the Tesla 3 is a sedan, the large battery in the center gives it the weight and low center of gravity, making it more nimble than many sports cars I‚Äôve owned before.

[Tesla Model 3 Battery](https://preview.redd.it/gk9bcx5dd5z51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=70a778a8d13c1914d0a029c882ccbc01be552ce0)

**Single Pedal Driving**

One of the coolest features of the Tesla is ‚Äúsingle pedal driving‚Äù using a technology called Regenerative Braking (Regen for short; [see Wikipedia for details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_brake)).¬†

When you let go of the accelerator, Regen enables your car to slow down rapidly while also charging your battery. My brake usage has reduced by 80% compared to conventional cars.¬† For example, you can have the car slow down quickly for turns or gradually come to a complete halt at stop signs, without having to use the brakes.¬†

Tesla provides an automatic brake HOLD function that enables your car to stay at a complete stop, without you having to keep your foot on the brake (e.g. at a red light). This HOLD feature also automatically engages, when the car slows down to 0 MPH.

The HOLD function complements regenerative braking, since you can let go of the accelerator while approaching a red light and have the car come to a complete stop, without having to use the brake pedal (i.e. single pedal driving).

**FSD/Autopilot**

If you‚Äôve seen the 2004 movie ‚ÄúI, Robot‚Äù starring Will Smith (as Detective Del Spooner), there‚Äôs a scene after he crashes a car, when his lieutenant yells this at him: ‚ÄúWhat is the matter with you? Traffic Ops tells me you‚Äôre driving your car **manually**.‚Äù

We are as close to fully autonomous cars, as we've ever been in our lifetime.

There are [five levels to autonomous vehicles](https://www.truecar.com/blog/5-levels-autonomous-vehicles/):

1. Driver Assistance
2. Partial Automation
3. Conditional Automation
4. High Automation
5. Full Automation

Tesla currently has Level 2 in its cars but has already demonstrated Level 3, in this [popular two-minute YouTube video by Tesla](https://youtu.be/tlThdr3O5Qo).

However, even just Level 2 FSD is one of the coolest features in the car, since it significantly reduces the driver fatigue.¬†

[FSD - Highway \(Utah\), Night \(Tahoe\) and Golden Gate Bridge \(San Francisco\)](https://preview.redd.it/kisd9wild5z51.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=11204de40d8ba854aed880f87be5684a7798a730)

FSD is a suite of features including Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, Autosteer, Navigate on Autopilot, Auto Lane Change, and others (e.g. Autopark, Traffic and Stop Sign Control).

FSD literally saves you so much driving that, at times, you feel like you‚Äôre babysitting the car, by just leaving one hand on the steering wheel with your feet lounging.

I tell friends driving with FSD feels like playing a video game in a comfortable lounge chair, where you have to pay enough attention to not die but you‚Äôre enjoying every minute of it.¬†

I use FSD anywhere and everywhere there are visible lane markings, from 25 MPH street to 80 MPH highway, speed zones.

This technology keeps getting better with every software update ‚Äî I‚Äôve literally seen how it handles so much better over the past year, around things like construction areas.

You can engage just Autopilot (Traffic-Aware Cruise Control) by pressing the cruise control lever fully down once. To engage the full FSD, you press the lever down twice ‚Äî this activates Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, Autosteer, Navigate on Autopilot, and Auto Lane Change.

Let‚Äôs take a closer look at how FSD works.

[According to Tesla‚Äôs website](https://www.tesla.com/autopilot), ‚ÄúEight surround cameras provide 360 degrees of visibility around the car at up to 250 meters of range. Twelve updated ultrasonic sensors complement this vision, allowing for detection of both hard and soft objects at nearly twice the distance of the prior system. A forward-facing radar with enhanced processing provides additional data about the world on a redundant wavelength that is able to see through heavy rain, fog, dust and even the car ahead.‚Äù

&#x200B;

[FSD - Cameras, Auto Lane Change](https://preview.redd.it/8pxjibmpd5z51.png?width=1044&format=png&auto=webp&s=d69549ef1e372db0409597dce71b2b2df0b335f5)

The Auto Lane Change feature is amazing and I absolutely love using it each time! You change lanes by simply giving the turn signal and let your car do the rest; i.e. the car will automatically change lanes, when it‚Äôs safe.¬†

While doing my cross-country road trip, I came up with two supplemental terms to *Auto Lane Change:*

* *Delayed Auto Lane Change:* When you know you can‚Äôt change lanes due to traffic, you can go ahead and ‚Äúqueue‚Äù your lane change request and the Model 3 will change lanes, when safe.¬†
* *Accelerated Auto Lane Change*: When you don‚Äôt want to wait, so you speed up to create a safe distance between the cars, which triggers Tesla to change lanes.

FSD requires you to have your hands on the steering wheel every 20-30 seconds ‚Äî I rest my left or right hand on the bottom part of the steering wheel to avoid getting the warnings but I‚Äôve heard of people using their legs, water bottles and other crazy ways to fool Tesla‚Äôs FSD into thinking your hands are on the wheel.

I‚Äôm a bit embarrassed to be boastful about this but I‚Äôve come to rely so much on FSD that depending on surrounding traffic, I‚Äôll work on my mobile device momentarily (e.g. editing documents, instant messages, quick web browsing). I feel irresponsible and guilty but part of me thinks, this is how we‚Äôll gradually move to FSD‚Ä¶a couple of seconds at a time.

While I absolutely LOVE FSD and use it for 80% of my driving (highway, local), I can‚Äôt see a door-to-door FSD till 2022 or later, due to factors including Tesla‚Äôs technology, roads (e.g. lane marketings) and legislation.

Tesla‚Äôs FSD technology is already phenomenal and getting better rapidly but it has quirks that still gives me (and my family) a scare every now and then ‚Äî enough for me to pay attention to the road.

You can learn more about Tesla‚Äôs FSD technology here: [tesla.com/autopilotAI](https://www.tesla.com/autopilotAI).

# 5. Charging

One of the things people worry about with fully electric cars is running out of charge ‚Äî after two years of ownership and a cross-country road trip, I can assure you, this has rarely been a problem for me.

Many of my friends can‚Äôt believe I still charge on 120v, after 2 years of owning my car! I realize it‚Äôs extremely inefficient but we were considering moving and I just haven‚Äôt felt the need for it since I work from home.¬†

120v (Level 1) charges at a pathetic 5 MPH but you can get 50+ miles overnight. 240v (Level 2) chargers charge between 10-50 MPH and direct current faster chargers (Level 3) such as the Tesla‚Äôs superchargers, can charge from a couple hundred to 1,000 MPH (using the new [V3 Supercharging](https://www.tesla.com/blog/introducing-v3-supercharging)).

[Tesla Supercharger Network and Three Levels of Charging \(source: pluglesspower.com\)](https://preview.redd.it/cr86kfv3h5z51.png?width=912&format=png&auto=webp&s=aacfb81110e23ec437a28663e7e1702fdf0ce7f2)

[According to Tesla‚Äôs website](https://www.tesla.com/supercharger), as of November 2020, there were 2,000+ Supercharger stations (20,000+ Supercharger outlets) worldwide, with many more coming soon.

Of course, you can always use 3rd party chargers or use the charging cable and adapter that comes with the Tesla. [According to Statistica](https://www.statista.com/statistics/416750/number-of-electric-vehicle-charging-stations-outlets-united-states/), there were over 24,000 charging stations (with over 78,000 outlets) in the US, as of September 2020.

# 6. Safety

Tesla cars have the honor of receiving some of the highest safety ratings possible, thanks to their driver/passenger protection (e.g. airbags, rollover, alerts).

For example, here‚Äôs a graphic from Tesla‚Äôs website, showing all 5-star ratings for a Tesla Model 3, from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).

[Tesla NHTSA Rating and Model 3 Airbags](https://preview.redd.it/l9w64qhye5z51.png?width=1069&format=png&auto=webp&s=9056a6f032ca329d1a68b021dfb792b0d3b87779)

From close by objects in your garage to objects on the highway, Tesla 3 has you covered with alerts.¬†

While driving, Tesla constantly detects surrounding objects and displays them on the touchscreen (e.g. car, trucks, motorcycles, people, stop lights, lane markings). Any endangering aspects will show up in red (e.g. lane changes, passing cars).

# 7. Maintenance

EVs in general require much less maintenance than internal combustion automobiles. Tesla maintenance comes mostly in the form of software.

Tesla updates the software in the car automatically, every month or so. If you‚Äôre new to a Tesla, it takes a little getting used to receiving software updates, similar to your smartphone or computer. Till this day, I find it fascinating that Tesla cars are just as much software (or more), as they are hardware.

[Tesla Software Updates and Mobile Service](https://preview.redd.it/grlurej2f5z51.png?width=1069&format=png&auto=webp&s=1473748eb4852dffe936982a60541e118886bcf4)

Tesla is also known to roll out some significant improvements via software updates ‚Äî something you would expect to take your car in for (e.g. an acceleration boost from 4.4 to 3.9 seconds).

Much of any hardware maintenance can be done via Tesla‚Äôs mobile service, where someone comes out to wherever you want. For example, I just had my two-year service done for $192.05, in my driveway (see [Tesla‚Äôs Car Maintenance page](https://www.tesla.com/support/car-maintenance) for details) with the following note in the electronic invoice:

>*‚ÄúChecked Brake Fluid Brake Fluid at 80% life. Replaced Pair of Wiper Blades. Replaced Cabin Filter. Maintenance Performed Tire Rotation on Passengers side only, Drivers side tires are good where they are right now. Recommend new pass front tire soon.‚Äù*

All other major services can be handled at one of Tesla‚Äôs [Service Centers](https://www.tesla.com/findus/list/services/United%20States), by scheduling via the mobile app.¬†

In my area, they tend to be booked 2 to 4 weeks out but the service otherwise is courteous and efficient, handled using a combination of SMS texts, in person and email communications and generous Uber/Lyft credits to get around.

One thing I‚Äôve found to be a pain is when you have a flat tire ‚Äî the 18‚Ä≥ tires used on a Tesla 3 can be expensive and hard to find, since they have acoustic foam inside them. This was the #1 concern on my mind, while traveling on my cross-country road trip.

# 8. Community

Unsurprisingly, Tesla has a huge fan base including online social networks, offline clubs, third party apps, and much more. The following are some popular clubs and third-party apps that I‚Äôve come across and/or use regularly.

**Clubs**

1. Reddit: [r/Teslamotors](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/), [r/TeslaModel3](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModel3/), [r/TeslaLounge](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/), [r/TeslaCam](https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaCam/)
2. Forums: [Official Tesla Forums](https://forums.tesla.com/), [Tesla Owners Online](https://teslaownersonline.com/), [Tesla Motors Club](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/forums/model-3.137/), [SpeakEV Tesla Model 3](https://www.speakev.com/forums/tesla-model-3/)
3. News: [Teslarati.com](https://www.teslarati.com/), [Electrek](https://electrek.co/guides/tesla/), [CleanTechnica](https://cleantechnica.com/tag/tesla/)

**Apps**

Before my cross-country road trip, I decided to hook up my Tesla account to three northworthy third-party apps that many online EV/Tesla enthusiasts seemed to be recommending:

1. [Teslafi](https://www.teslafi.com/index.php?search=2020-08-14): Logs data for all your drives with amazing detail (e.g. graphs, battery consumption, maps, charging stops).
2. [A Better Route Planner (ABRP)](https://abetterrouteplanner.com/?plan_uuid=99b25e8f-60a4-4cb4-90fa-f42b107793f3): Popular app used for more precise planning based on your EVs model.
3. [Stats](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stats-for-tesla-model-s-x-3/id1191100729): Provides several bells & whistles for Apple mobile devices (iPhone/iPad/Watch); e.g. schedule climate/charging, open doors/trunks via Siri, monitor battery health, and more.

It was a bit nerve-wracking to give my username and password to these apps but once you have an authentication key from one of them, you can use that for the others.

Advanced users with coding skills can use the [unofficial Tesla JSON API](https://tesla-api.timdorr.com/) to obtain an authentication key or use [Teslamate](https://github.com/adriankumpf/teslamate), a self-hosted data logger with dashboards for driving, charging, efficiency, drain, stats, and much more.

Once you‚Äôre setup with these apps, the amazing data they provide makes the whole process worthwhile, as you can see from some of the screenshots below.

[Third Party Tesla Apps](https://preview.redd.it/lcysj747f5z51.png?width=1408&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf8ff9e5568b408e912033272496d67fc030f399)

**Aftermarket**

There are plenty of aftermarket products for Tesla available on various websites.¬†I‚Äôve only purchased two aftermarket products: a Qi wireless phone charger and a spare tire kit by Modern Spare.

# 9. Cost

As of November 2020, here were the list prices for the three versions of a Tesla Model 3, in the US:

1. Standard Range Plus: $37,990 (range 263 miles)
2. Long Range: $46,990 (353 miles)
3. Performance: $54,990 (315 miles)

FSD costs an extra $10,000.

If you‚Äôre considering buying any kind of EV, you can calculate the cost per mile by dividing its list price by its maximum range. For example, a Tesla Model 3 Long Range at a list price of $46,990 and range of 353 miles costs $133/mile, as shown in the below infographic from [visualcapitalist.com](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/range-evs-major-highway-routes/).

One thing to keep in mind when comparing prices is that Tesla is years ahead of its competition with its innovative technology and supercharger network ‚Äî something that‚Äôs hard to put an exact value on.

[Cost of EV Ownership \(source: visualcapitalist.com\)](https://preview.redd.it/6vq5v7v9f5z51.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a225532b1be4a97fbae76406afe514736760acf)

# 10. Improvements

I‚Äôve owned some nice cars in my lifetime but never have I owned a car that I loved driving so much every single day, as much as I have my Tesla Model 3.

Tesla is as close to perfect as a car gets but it can use some tweaks, so here‚Äôs a list of flaws and/or wishes:

1. **Alerts:** The on screen blind spot warnings aren‚Äôt good enough; most people have come to expect something built into the side mirrors.¬†
2. **Wipers:** Tesla‚Äôs automatic wipers were horrible but since [Tesla launched its ‚ÄòDeep Rain‚Äô neural network](https://electrek.co/2019/10/14/tesla-deep-rain-neural-net-automatic-wipers/), they have improved over the past year but still remain slightly flaky (e.g. turning on a couple of times when it‚Äôs not raining).
3. **Voice:** Support for voice commands is weak and nowhere as robust as Apple Siri or Google Assistant, which can be frustrating since I often have to turn to my iPhone (e.g. calling a local restaurant).
4. **Lights:** It would be nice to have shortcuts to turn the head/park lights on/off, instead of going into Settings.
5. **Map:** Tesla‚Äôs map is absolutely amazing but it‚Äôs missing waypoints, so you end up having to use something like the ABRP app (discussed above). Also, It would be great to see icons for what‚Äôs nearby (e.g. restaurants, service stations), similar to supercharger icons.¬†
6. **FSD:** Traffic-Aware Cruise Control is overcautious, e.g. it‚Äôll keep 3 to 6 cars worth of distance versus the 1 car, I have it set at. Also, given the choice between tracking using the left and right lanes, FSD chooses to hug the right side, which is extremely annoying on highways (e.g. merging from on-ramps). Approaching stopped traffic at a red light on a major road can be nerve-wracking since the car waits too long to begin gracefully slowing down, thereby requiring harsher/faster braking later. The merging on and off ramp with construction barrels, needs improvement.
7. **Battery:** The remaining battery life isn‚Äôt 100% accurate to rely on entirely, since it doesn‚Äôt take into account leakage, winter weather, winds, etc. It can be nerve-wracking when you think you have 20%, just to find it‚Äôs dropped to 15% (and dropping).
8. **Apps:** While it was great to be able to hook up third party apps, it would be nice if Tesla officially sanctioned them via some sort of an online marketplace and support for API keys. It would also be cool to add more 3rd party apps support; e.g. Waze, Amazon Prime, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto). Lastly, it takes too long to load the existing apps (e.g. Netflix, YouTube).
9. **Music:**  The music icon should be indicative of the map feature or the music and maps screens need to be separated. The music portion of the screen allows resizing but blocks the directions, in larger view. The music screen should provide more granular controls for track and display the time for songs (e.g. time left/played). There‚Äôs no way to pause/mute the radio on the screen (you have to use the wheel on the steering wheel). Lastly, the Spotify interface is flaky (e.g. long load times, checkmark is confusing).
10. **Tires:** I realize many cars nowadays do not include spare tires but it would be nice if Tesla provided third party options on your website, similar to how Apple/Google have marketplaces with reviews, for third party products (e.g. Spare Tire Kit by Modern Spare). Of course, Tesla does offer [roadside assistance service](https://www.tesla.com/roadside-assistance).
11. **Superchargers:** It would be nice to have a tall, physical Tesla sign at supercharging stops, since it can be hard to find charging stations in places like shopping centers. A nice trick is to zoom in the destination using the satellite view of the map.
12. **Service:** It can take from a couple to a few weeks to get a service appointment. I suspect some of the backlog is due to the [issues earlier models had](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-tesla-model-3-survey/). I had one major and a couple of minor issues early on (steering wheel replacement, door hinges), which were covered under factory warranty and addressed quickly by Tesla.
13. **Miscellaneous:** Having to reboot occasionally and/or rare black screen. Inside door opening controls can be confusing for first timers, since they look like window controls.¬†Better/adjustable seat headrest that don't stick out so much. Rear windshield wipers to avoid water build up.

# Conclusion

As detailed as this review is, I haven‚Äôt covered many features, for example Navigate on Autopilot, Autopark, Lane Assist, chime on green traffic light, automatic high beam, driver profiles, and so much more.

Additionally, Tesla continuously delivers features, so it‚Äôs not feasible to list everything here. For example, the beta version of the completely rewritten FSD [began rolling out in October 2020](https://electrek.co/2020/10/20/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-rollout-elon-musk-slow-cautious/). For more information on software updates and other great resources, visit [tesla.com/support](https://www.tesla.com/support).

In my opinion, Tesla is years ahead of anything comparable on the market currently, thanks to their technology, customer data, supercharger network, battery life, customer service, and more.

Tesla has reinvented the car and thought of so many conveniences (e.g. single pedal driving, auto unlock/lock doors, low maintenance), that it makes it a pleasure to drive and own this car, every single day. Even long distance driving feels more like an enjoyable journey rather than a chore.¬†

If you‚Äôre considering buying a Tesla 3, do it. Imagine driving the car of the future, today!

TeslaMotors,frustrating,nq7b2a,My experience owning a model 3 for ~ 6 months,"I wanted to make this post to share my experience as I have had a less than stellar experience dealing with tesla as a company and a mixed experience dealing with the local service centre. 

I picked up my M3 in December 2020 (it is now June 2021 as of writing this). I love my car but I have now had the following services done (all warranty):

- drivers side seat adjustment control malfunction (had to have mobile team visit twice because they couldn‚Äôt emulate it, I had to video it)

- drive train unit failure (this was a big one). car wouldn‚Äôt start one day after work. Had to be flatbed towed, stored somewhere over night and got a rent a car from tesla.

- charge port door failure (would technically work but the physical press sensor failed)

- drivers side rear speaker grill falling off 
(for this one, they were going to charge me the labour, as the service team heavily implied while speaking to me that the only way that it would happen is if I hit it with something, even tho it‚Äôs covid and I never have anyone in my back seat, and I noticed that after it was fixed that a bit of rattling I heard while driving decreased[which I thought was just the frameless windows]. To which the service manager said I should have brought it in for that earlier to which I said, should I have to inspect every interior inch of a brand new car??? Which by the way, I used on of the meany pick up check lists and this car checked all of the major boxes upon pick up)

- today, the drivers seat lumbar adjustment stopped working.

Now, I love my car, but for a car that is brand new only being 6 months old, this is getting very tiring and embarrassing that it‚Äôs having this many issues. I‚Äôm frustrated that there is no path of escalation past speaking to the service manager and he seems to be in no rush to improve my experience.

For reference, I am located in west coast Canada.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,d9suh7,Not allowing split capacity with Supercharging V3 is a mistake (hear me out),"This is based on the assumption that the added hardware needed to split the power is not a significant expense relative to the total cost of a V3 supercharger.

I know a lot of us have felt the frustration of someone pulling in next to us at a V2 charger right after we start to charge, and watch the rate drop and the estimated charge time climb. I think this would be largely mitigated had Tesla chose a different way to split the charger. Instead of splitting evenly between two cars, whoever plugged in first should be able to charge at their max rate, with the other vehicle charging only at whatever capacity is left. This would allow the first vehicle to plug in to finish charging and leave much more quickly, freeing up the spot.

This would make an even bigger difference with V3, since one car can only handle the max rate for a much shorter period of time. Without splitting there will be significant wasted capacity.

In the case of supercharging locations that have significant wait times, assuming they are not space constrained, but rather constrained by the cost, you could get much better utilization of the investment and there would be no worries about someone charging to 100% because there would be someone parked next to them still getting 200 kW or more while someone else is getting their last few %",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/d9suh7/not_allowing_split_capacity_with_supercharging_v3/,zipdiss,21313.0,0.6946

I suggested he get a Tesla Model 3 and this is the conversation that follows:

Me: ""You should get a Tesla Model 3.""

Bro and Mom: *stares blankly at me*

Bro: ""What's a Tesla?""

Me: ""It's an electric car company and the Model 3 is their newest car starting at $35K.""

Bro: *laughs* ""35K? That's a lot!"" I'm going to the dealer this Friday to see what used car I can find so I can get a better one later once I save up more money.""

Me: ""Why though? You can put money down for the Model 3 now and it will save you money in the long run. You don't have to pay for gas, its has less maintenance costs, and you can charge it from home.""

Mom: ""What if he wants to take a trip to the coast. How will he charge his car then?""

Me: ""There is a supercharger on the way where you can charge your car.""

Mom: *confused* (Probably thinking what the heck is a supercharger.)

Bro: ""I don't know. Why don't you come to the dealer with me and I'll think about it.""

Me: ""It won't be at the dealers. You order it online."" (Found out a few hours later when I searched for a near-by Tesla dealership, we actually have one in my city.)

Mom and Bro: *laugh their heads off at me*

Bro: ""I'm not buying a car online! Are you crazy?!""

Me: *tries to explain more about Tesla, electric cars and cost savings*

Mom and Bro: *keeps changing the subject and then ignoring me*

I finally said: ""I still have a good number of years on my own car but my next one will be a Tesla. Maybe not the Model 3 but the next one they will come out with. I'm GETTING a Tesla.""

Mom and bro: *looks at me blankly*

And that is what happened at dinner yesterday.

I became very frustrated but then I thought how ignorant and dumb their line of thought was about it all and I just felt sorry for them.

Been doing a trip across Europe with the family and tbh the phantom braking is taking rediculous form.

The day before that 2 times, the day before that 4 times so 9 times in just over 1200 km's. 4 different countries, no reason what so ever to brake. I turned off all beta stuff like self driving but still the phantom braking is rediculous, up to the point my wife wants me to not use cruise control which in the case of 6-700 km a day is really uncomfortable. 

I can accept that stuff like autopilot and NoA is beta and could have surprising results, but how can we get at least a reliable cruise control...

Starting of at 280 km I arrive with only 50km left! 

So a 110km trip drains 230km of battery. That‚Äôs nuts.

I drive about 15 km above speed range. So 115 average. I have the non refreshed version 2020(lucky me)

TeslaMotors,frustrating,grifik,Model Y Delivery Scheduled in 2 Weeks - Finance and Trade In Expired,"I received a text from Tesla yesterday stating my ""Model Y is ready to be scheduled for delivery"" and to login to my account to select the date (June 9).  However, after speaking with my delivery specialist, it seems as though the loan has since expired and so has the trade in quote.

Apparently the Tesla loans are valid for 60 days and the trade in quotes are valid for 30 days or 1000 miles.  I recall seeing the trade in quote terms but not the loan.  Tesla finance said I need to refresh/reapply again which will result in another hard credit pull--annoying but my credit score is fairly good @ 820 so I'm not too worried.  Last time (March 2020) I received a 72 months @ 2.75% APR.

Due to the current climate, I haven't driven more than a couple hundred miles since my last quote.    There's been quite a bit of misinformation during the process from Tesla resulting in a lot of back and forth and I understand the demand is high for the Y, so they probably could just pass my order along to the next person in line.

Has anyone had experience negotiating with Tesla to honor previous quotes, and if so, what was the result?  Seems to now be big rush from my specialist to get this all done which I get but hoping to use it to my advantage.

Build:

* Model Y
* Long Range All-Wheel Drive
* Pearl White Paint
* 19‚Äô‚Äô Gemini Wheels
* All Black Premium Interior
* Five Seat Interior
* Autopilot

Here's the build of my current 2018 M3 which I'm now debating trading in:

* Long Range All-Wheel Drive
* All Black Premium Interior
* Pearl White Multi-Coat
* 18‚Äô‚Äô Aero Wheels
* Full Self-Driving Capability
* \~19,000 miles

Here's the updated quotes I literally got today for the M3:

Tesla:  $39,500 (was $42,100 before the quote expired).  A -$2,500 decrease which hurts.

Carmax: $36,000 - these guys were clueless, at least the location I went to.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,74cbqm,Slacker Pro,"I decided to try out Slacker Premium today, after not being able to get any concrete answers about how it would behave in the car app. 

I've read differing reports from other owners saying that it works completely as expected, Slacker themselves told me it wouldn't work at all, so I thought I'd better just try it myself.

I'm going to put my impressions here to hopefully save anyone else the trouble and money if it's not going to do what they want.

**What I was most hoping for**

The ability to play any song I wanted (via search) without restriction. Playlist support would be a nice bonus.

I'll admit this is mostly because my kids always ask for specific songs and I hate having to say ""nope, sorry, we've listed to that one too recently"".

**What I got**

 Very minimal playlist support, with unlimited plays but only in the context of a playlist.

**Things to know up front**

* It is not possible to upgrade your freebie Tesla Slacker Plus+ account to Premium
* It is not possible to transfer any account info (favorites, stations, etc) to your new account
* There is no discount, your Plus+ account is already paid for, getting a new Premium account is full price

**Details on Premium account in Tesla app**

* The only thing that really gets added is the ability to to play playlists you've created in your Slacker account. 
* While playing a playlist, you can use the back button to repeat songs, and play songs as many times as you like.
* There is no ability to create or modify playlists in the car.
* Playing a song outside of a playlist, such as via search, still has the same 24-hours-ish play restriction. Most often you'll just get a station of the song you wanted, not the song itself.
* I've read that playlists won't show up right away, the app syncs infrequently, but logging out and back in forces a refresh. I didn't try any of this out myself, I created a playlist before signing into my new account in the car, and that playlist showed up immediately.

**How close to my goal**

If I were able to choose all the songs I may want to hear in advance and add them to a playlist, and I was willing to go find the songs I want to listen to in that playlist, then I could achieve my goal of being able to play what I want when I want.
It's frustrating how close this is, but it's very awkward to have to choose songs in advance, and not safe to have to find them in a list rather than using voice control. I'll be cancelling my Premium subscription and hoping everything is back to normal when I log out.

**tl;dr**

Unless you're extremely eager to be able to have custom Slacker playlists in the car, it is not worth upgrading.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,hl6wgd,Summon connection issues are awful.,"I consistently get disconnected errors when using summon to back my Model 3 into the garage. I have had the car over a year now and have probably only successfully summoned without disconnects maybe 2 times. I just tried again on 2020.24.6.4 and had to try about 20 times before it finally worked.

It typically goes like this:
* Stand in the garage, about 12 ft from the car using a Pixel 3xl
* Open the Tesla app and go to summon screen.
* Summon buttons typically show up quickly
* Press and hold the reverse button.
* Mirrors fold in and summon immediately disconnects
* Release reverse button and wait for it to show up again.
* Repeat previous two steps several times
* Eventually, the car moves, but disconnects after moving a few feet

It generally takes me at least 12 - 20 attempts before it finally works. It's been bad since I got it but today was really frustrating because it seems to have gotten worse lately. It would be a very useful feature for me if it worked I just wish it worked.

Does it work fine for others or is it like this for everyone?

TeslaMotors,frustrating,9jc0q1,[Discussion] When does your car become your car?,"**TL/DR - I have been going through quite a delivery coordination ordeal, and now Tesla is threatening to sell ""my"" car to someone else if I can't get to the delivery center on Sunday.**

Originally I was given a window of September 20-27 for pickup of my car. I live 5.5 hours  (315 miles) from the nearest Tesla location in the US, so I figured I would be offered home delivery (per the website - if you live more than 150 miles away). I was not offered home delivery, and I made significant life accommodations to pick up the car on September 20th, which was the only day within the window that I was able to commit to because of my co-registrant/spouse's pre-arranged travel commitments. Lo and behold, Tesla did not have its act together and my car was not at the delivery location by that date (luckily I discovered this a couple of days before delivery day, so I didn't travel to discover this). Tesla agreed to home delivery after this, and set me up with a delivery specialist to coordinate this. Whom I didn't hear from until many days later when I was told that the delivery truck is running 3 days behind and could I pick up instead?

So I have been trying every which way to coordinate a pickup on September 30th. I agreed to rent a car 2 hours from my house, drive it another 2 hours to meet my spouse returning from their trip in another city to collect signatures on the paperwork, then to drive 6 hours from there to my delivery location to pick up the car (and then, of course, to drive the 5.5 hours home, theoretically in my new car). How crazy does all this sound? Only I discovered that all of the nearby car rental returns are full so I can't return a one-way rental to this location because Tesla has such a huge push on people getting to this location to pick up their cars this weekend. So I literally can't pick up my car this weekend because:

* Tesla couldn't meet their initial delivery window which included September 20th
* Tesla couldn't coordinate home delivery ""in time""
* Tesla has so many people picking up this weekend that the car rental returns are full

In the meantime, in good faith, I have been diligently working on obtaining a loan tied to the car with this VIN (check is literally in the mail, which means I am now accruing interest), and I have signed MVPA paperwork with this VIN. Now my delivery coordinator is telling me that if I can't get in to pick up the car on Sunday that they will deassign my VIN and sell the car to someone who can pick up by the end of the month, and I would be put back into the queue with no idea when I could get another assignment. Is this allowed? I literally have a contract with Tesla tying me to this VIN, and have a loan tied to this VIN, and I have tried to make it possible to get to the delivery center (with tremendous hardship!) to accommodate Tesla's timeline. What are my options here? Although my delivery coordinator has been really nice and has tried to accommodate me as much as possible (offering car rental reimbursement, etc) I am really frustrated with this experience and I don't know how to proceed. Any thoughts?

TeslaMotors,frustrating,pyknzd,First Time Driving a Tesla - some thoughts,"I am a 46 year old male and this past week in Estes Park, CO I got to drive a Tesla 3 for the very first time.  I was really excited about it as I had seen and read so much about it.  We paid more for a rental that claimed to have FSD.

First compliments : 

Tesla has truly reengineered the driving experience in the same way that Apple re-wrote what a cellphone should be.  You don't turn it on.  You just drive it.  It's completely silent.  Everything in the car is centered around the idea that you will always have internet and that mammoth touchscreen.  The car is tied to your phone and responds to you automatically in ways that just make sense.

The accelerator was honestly my favorite part of the entire experience.  I get horrible shooting pains in my hip when I have to consistently shift from gas to brake.  Being able to manage the entire drive with one foot on one pedal, just letting regenerative braking take care of the rest.  I wish my car would treat my accelerator as a throttle instead of as just a gas pedal.  It's a revelation and I loved it.

The linear acceleration - I've never experienced anything like that.  Even in my brother's very suped-up subaru you still have to wait for the engine to engage the gear before you get the power.  Tesla's acceleration is mind blowing and instantly responsive, all the way on or all the way off it's smooth as silk.  Especially with on ramps and lane changes, that acceleration is a real life saver.

The interior - the striking lack of a driver dashboard really makes you feel like you're in an episode of the Jetsons.  Everything is just so perfectly sculpted.  Like the Apple iPhone, you can tell that Tesla actually uses the products that they sell and have already thought through things like ""i want my phone accessible while I drive"".  Overall, just extremely impressed when it works the way it should.

Frustrations : 

In the spirit of full disclosure, I have been driving with [Comma.ai](https://Comma.ai)'s OpenPilot for almost 12 months and while it is far from perfect, I like what I know it can do.  The driver facing camera is a real difference maker that sets it apart.

My interest in Tesla is largely driven by my desire to no longer control my car.  We are well past the point where a computer can handle pretty basic driving functions like maintaining a safe following distance, keeping centered in a lane and stopping for traffic lights and to a lesser extent, stop signs, roundabouts and turns.

This is where the Tesla let me down in a way that I really didn't expect.  I never could figure out the ""apply pressure to the wheel"" mechanic.  I think it's bad design.  My eyes are on the road - there's flashing on the screen that I'm ignoring because my eyes are on the road.  The system starts beeping and so I grab the wheel and autosteer disengages because it thinks I want to steer now.  Turn it back on, rinse and repeat and every time the Tesla eventually got to the point where it said ""autosteer is no longer available for the duration of this drive.""

I need to be able to correct Tesla's steering lines without it disengaging autosteer, especially on Estes Park's many winding and mountainous roads.  On many occasions, I wanted the Tesla to steer about 6 inches wider than it was and doing so deactivated autosteer.  That was incredibly frustrating.

Sometimes the tesla would slow down for a really high torque curve and sometimes it wouldn't.  I couldn't seem to get a feel for why that was.  At best it seemed to be inconsistent.

I don't think the car that I had actually had full self drive.  The best that I ever saw was ""navigate with autopilot"" which was also a disaster.  The navigation clearly showed a left was needed at the next intersection and the car inexplicably veered hard into the right turn lane.  I tried again and again to get autopilot but either I got locked out of autosteer or the car made mistakes and I had to take over.

Something completely different - I found the charging experience to be annoying.  When your car runs out of gas, you spend 5 minutes at a gas station and you're back on the road.  There's no adapters and the entire process is short.  We pulled into the the Estes Park visitor center and found a charging station by ""Centerpoint"" - no matter how we configured the adapter given to us, it would not fit onto the Tesla - that's a game breaker.  There's no gas station I can go to in America that doesn't fit my car.  Also we spent two evenings at 30 minutes each at a Tesla SuperCharger that was inexplicably gated into a paid entrance hotel.  They let us in without expense but I found that odd to say the least.  I wasn't really interested in playing games or watching movies on the screen although it became clear to me why that function was there.  Obviously, if you own one, you're charging it at your house and you don't have this issue.

Overall for me the experience completely breaks at autosteer disengaging when I make corrections to the driving line.  If the road is splitting into two lanes I need to be able to tell you what lane to turn into.  I also found the separate controls for acceleration and steering to be unnecessary.  Either I'm driving or the car is driving, full stop.

I think it's an incredible marvel of engineering but until they iron out all the full self drive stuff, it's not something I would buy for myself for any price, let alone the $60k price tags I see for used models in my area.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/pyknzd/first_time_driving_a_tesla_some_thoughts/,jcwillia1,76394.0,0.6529

TeslaMotors,frustrating,nehpyx,noob rents a model Y,"I've been thinking that next year I would hope to get a Tesla and had been lightly researching the different models and features. When the hysteria about a gasoline shortage sprung up and my family had a trip scheduled to go from the East coast of Florida to the West coast, I spontaneously decided to rent a Telsa for the trip to not worry about gas and evaluate how I would like one.

&#x200B;

First, I loved many aspects of the car that I'm sure virtually everyone in r/TelsaMotors knows about. Quiet, roomy, excellent ride, cool computer system, visualization of cars and obstacles, etc, etc.

&#x200B;

The car I rented through Turo only had the basic Autopilot. I didn't think to check since I had always assumed that I would get the more advanced system, and I just assumed everyone would do the same .

&#x200B;

Leaving on a Friday, we headed across florida, first on the turnpike, and then on a mix of 4 lane divided highway and 2 lane roads. The radar cruise control worked well but didn't seem to do the stop and go correctly. In retrospect, i think I was putting my foot on the brake during the stop and go which would disable the cruise control. Fortunately the stop and go portion of the trip was just a few minutes so I didn't get to check if it that was what limited it.

&#x200B;

? Most of the trip across was 2 lane roads mostly unlit and dark. I found the Auto steering to be unpleasant. When meeting large trucks at 60+ mph, I like to hug the right shoulder and give more space to oncoming traffic. The auto steer doesn't do that. It precisely stayed in the middle of the lane. I eventually disconnected the auto steer and just did my hugging thing.

&#x200B;

? On the return trip we went I-75 the whole way across Alligator Alley. Auto steering worked great! Only once in a 200 mile trip, did it do something wrong where it started to follow an exit ramp. I'm not sure if it would have corrected its path but I interrupted it by instinctively jerking it back to the correct path.

&#x200B;

? However, I found passing to be very frustrating. If I signaled to change lanes, it would disengage (which is ok, I understand that lane changes is not a feature of the basic Autopilot) but it would do its disengage chime. Then when finishing the pass, I would re-engage with another set of chimes. I don't mind the chimes but it distracted the family from the book we were listening to. Fortunately traffic was light on a Sunday morning so this only happened maybe 10 times in our four hour trip. I tried the move-the-right-control-stalk-up trick to disengage the autosteer, but it still made the chime. Most annoying. Is there a better way to handle basic autopilot steering and passing?

&#x200B;

Various other observations: We went to a total of four superchargers. I was a little concerned that i'd get there and there would be a line of people wanting to charge, but that was never the case. I guess they were all version 2's, since they all had 2A 2B kind of markings. One of superchargers was before the trip to top it off, so it was just me. Two of the other stops we scheduled a meal at, so that worked out great. The last one the kids did karaoke using the car's entertainment system, so that was cool.

&#x200B;

The side mirrors seem a bit small and I might investigate aftermarket mirrors if (or rather when) I get a Tesla. I didn't really like doing everything through the touch screen. I just want to lower the fan and you've got to take your eye off the road and touch smallish icons. The doors seemed a bit clunky? Not quite sure how to describe it, but they don't have the same solid feel that I'm used to.

Even if you're satisfied with Tesla as it exists today, wouldn't you want your (and others') experience to improve?  What is the downside to any of my suggested changes?

\---------------------

To Whom it May Concern:

You sent me a survey to better understand my post-purchase vehicle satisfaction. I'm sure you'll be pleased to see that I am clearly still absolutely enthralled with my Model S even after almost 2 years of ownership.  To provide a balanced perspective, I felt it was important to also provide feedback on how I perceived your brand, peripheral support tools and services, as well as your various field service organizations.

To be clear, I am at least for now leaning towards NOT purchasing another Tesla as my next vehicle. My concerns are detailed below, and I'm sharing them because I believe Tesla still has an opportunity to change my leaning from ""likely not"" to ""likely yes,"" if steps are taken within the reasonable near term (e.g. 6-12 months).

What I‚Äôm looking for is a visible and authentic acknowledgment of the concerns (not just mine, but what you actually hear from your customers across the board, and what ""top 3"" issues or concerns emerge), along with a plan for addressing them. The best business is repeat business, and as things stand now from my vantage point, my and many others' repeat business is at serious risk.

Ok, so let's talk turkey.

Speaking only for myself, I have to be blunt. The Service Center experience (or, really, any experience that involves trying to speak with a real person during the buying or post-purchase process) is pretty terrible. It's a 1/10 in the ""something I have to do that isn't work or chores"" list, coming in just behind cleaning my pool filter. And it's not just one thing - it's a whole bunch of not-good experiences strung together over time.

First, it has to do with Tesla providing only one entry point to their service reservation system - the Tesla app. This should be a case study for bad UX and a single point of failure; but it's also impersonal, inefficient and in some cases even confusing for the customer. Because the app limits any real opportunity for problem solving or conversational dialogue with some who-knows-where disembodied service advisor, it results in multiple back-and-forth exchanges over time. I find myself describing the problem (if it‚Äôs not a simple issue, which I imagine represents at least a significant minority of your total service requests) or answering a (singular) question and waiting a day or two to hear back. Then, after having lost context when the response comes in at some point in the future, I tend to find the ""answer"" is another follow-up question or request for clarification. In many ways during this process, I'm reminded of how I feel I'm making an appointment with the DMV, and that's never a positive brand association. I do, however, rank the DMV appointment-making experience as marginally better than Tesla‚Äôs because with the DMV's system you can use a computer OR your mobile device.

Separate from the reservation process, let‚Äôs talk about the customer experience after arriving to the SC. My personal belief is that the odds of securing a loaner vehicle once on-site are about the same as the odds of hitting a royal flush in 5-card poker - a bad bet, to be sure. As a result, this leaves the customer with no choice but to make use of a provided Uber credit. I appreciate the fact that the credit is a fairly generous number and supports more than a few trips, and I also appreciate that Tesla HAS an option other than having to find a friend, spouse, or public transport. BUT - there is a non-trivial amount of hassle and inefficiency that other LUXURY brand dealership service centers eliminate.

And that means that if I take my vehicle to Audi, to BMW, or to Mercedes for service, I don't have to plan for how I will manage transportation DURING the period of service. Using Uber is better than nothing, but it is an added time and mental cost that other premium service experiences don't charge.

I get that Tesla is theoretically attempting to automate as much as possible and thereby keep labor costs to a minimum, but I would counsel Tesla leadership and brand stewards to consider the long-term impact; til recently and probably even currently, the cost of customer acquisition to Tesla has been low due to grassroots marketing, word-of-mouth, and the (now cancelled) Tesla referral program. Clearly, this marketing strategy can never be a long-term, guaranteed model. Customer churn is something to fear - and it happens in large part because the affected company chose to disregard the intrinsic value of being able to speak with someone on the phone or at least on a real-time (not asynchronous) live-chat system. This gives the customer confidence that IN THE MOMENT a company representative understands their issue and will work with them on a solution. The app-based service center approach is trading off efficiency and/or near-term cost savings for long-term customer disengagement and dissatisfaction.

Moving on, let‚Äôs stay within the broader category of customer frustration and brand reputational damage, but find a way of reducing both of those by investing in more thorough inspection of and correction for fit and finish issues. By this, I specifically mean inspection and correction when the vehicle comes off the assembly line versus half-hearted or ineffective attempts to do so when the vehicle is already in the delivery center and due to the customer in the next hours or day. I recognize that improving quality is more than just encouraging employees to pay better attention to detail - it requires a commitment to quality assurance as a manufacturing protocol that requires a non-trivial investment in training, people and infrastructure. However, I can't think of any other brand's $100K+ vehicle that have multiple documented instances where a trip to the service center was required immediately after purchase to address things like paint defects or removal of a random screw that was rolling around in the door panel.

And this isn‚Äôt the customer‚Äôs fault because they ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt find the issue during delivery.‚Äù As it turns out, issues with the vehicle tend to go unnoticed during the delivery process itself - due to the excitement of getting a new car and due to at least the first-time buyer‚Äôs lack of familiarity with the vehicle and delivery process itself. These issues could in fact have a material impact on vehicle quality and safety. And then what? What is a customer to do if they find these issues on their driveway versus at the DC? As far as I can find, there's no formal process for requesting remediation from Tesla, forcing the customer to search on forums or call other owners in an extremely frustrating and unexpected cram session on the dark art of navigating Tesla‚Äôs labyrinthine corporate support and service infrastructure.

I can empathize with how frustrating finding yourself in this situation can be - because I experienced it myself. Although the issues were ultimately resolved, it required over 20 phone calls (no exaggeration, I have the call logs to prove it) to find the right ""actual"" person to speak with and 2 separate visits to the service center to finally get the issues remediated. This included a rear quarter panel and bumper full repaint, replacement of a scratched carbon fiber spoiler, the B-Pillar cover and baseplate realigned so the metal wasn't showing, and the drivers-side LED trunk light permanently affixed in such a way that it no longer fell to the trunk floor every time I drove more than 2 miles.

The first-month ""honeymoon"" period of any person‚Äôs vehicle ownership tends to leave an indelible mark on a customer‚Äôs psyche - particularly if it was negative. In my case, it left me unable to make use of or consistently enjoy my vehicle for a full 8 calendar days during that month, and the resulting dissatisfaction I felt then is still as fresh in my mind as it was 2 years ago. In terms of leaving a bad taste in a customer's mouth, I equate it to a four-course meal of pickled herring paired with garlic-infused hummus, followed by a main dish of liver and onions and finished with a playfully spicy roquefort cheesecake and a carafe of day-old black coffee; unfiltered cigarettes as between-course ""palate-cleansing"" refreshment

In case it wasn't already clear, let me be blunt: I am currently unsupportive of Tesla as a brand and what it provides customers in the field. My own anecdotal personal observations, coupled with recent articles in mass media and posts on social media sites, lead me to believe that Tesla's brand has already been negatively impacted by Mr. Musk‚Äôs recent online and offline shenanigans. In particular, the Twitter debacle gives at least the appearance of disingenuous statements being made and bad-faith business practices being supported. This airing of dirty laundry is unfortunately (for Tesla) coinciding with ACTUAL availability of well-styled, performant, and equivalently (at the Model S and X tier) priced vehicle options from traditional auto manufacturers.

It's an unfortunate series of events for Tesla, but it presents potential EV (new and existing) with an unprecedented array of non-Tesla options. I suspect that the reason I‚Äôm receiving this survey 2 years after I purchased my vehicle may be driven in some part by a concern within Tesla corporate that maybe things aren‚Äôt all rainbows and unicorns in terms of overall customer satisfaction, and my goal with this ridiculously long diatribe is simply to tell you these four words: your concern is real. I suggest you work quickly to make some changes.

TL;DR - Focus Tesla‚Äôs ‚Äúsocial media‚Äù brand marketing to be more about the company itself than Mr. Musk, fix your pre-delivery quality issues, fix your lack of Service Center personalization, and find non-Uber options to (significantly) bolster your availability of in-service loaner vehicles. IMHO, even making it a goal or initiating a project/program that can be reported on as funded and to commence at a future date in your next 10K would be a very promising step forward.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/wgi5ko/sharing_with_yall_my_feedback_to_tesla_in/,ansyhrrian,487613.0,0.9678
TeslaMotors,frustrating,9eermx,Electronics Fried by Windshield Tint Install - Looking for Advice / Similar Experiences,"Before I begin, yes I've heard of this issue happening before. I live in AZ and have to park my car outside, so to me there's risks on both sides of tinting it and not tinting it. Before I got it tinted, I did my due diligence on finding the right tint installer (see below if you really want to know).

**The Issue:** Yesterday I went to go pick up my car after getting the windows tinted. When I got there, they were still working on it. I saw them finishing up squeegee-ing the windshield from the inside, and the electronics and dash were not even covered by towels or anything. I saw a steady stream of liquid go right into the area in the front that houses some of the electronics. When I finally got in the car, every error started popping up on the screen (front motor disabled, regen braking disabled, autopilot disabled, traction control disabled, ghost touches on the screen, etc.). I had the owner come check it out and he's keeping it over night in hopes it dries out and will be fine to drive later today. Luckily, the owner has been very nice in the process so far and has offered to pay damages and for me to borrow his car. However, that car is very heavily based on electronics, and I don't want to have me and my family in a car with Autopilot knowing that it has damaged electronics. Has anyone else had this problem? I found these 2 online, but they said very different amounts when it came to getting it fixed by Tesla ($10,000 vs $900): [https://www.tintdude.com/forum/topic/88317-tesla-model-3-warning/](https://www.tintdude.com/forum/topic/88317-tesla-model-3-warning/) and [https://www.tintdude.com/forum/topic/87783-tesla-3-windshield-film-computer-problems/](https://www.tintdude.com/forum/topic/87783-tesla-3-windshield-film-computer-problems/) 

**Not sure how to proceed:** I'm sure the owner will hope to have it turn on okay today, and let me drive off and just be done with it. But I don't want to accept it if it even turns on without major failures, since I don't know if this is going to cause more issues down the road in which would be impossible for me to prove it was the tinting installation problem. If it works, my plan is to take it to the service center on Monday and have them check it out just in case (they're closed on Sundays). If they find issues, I was going to have them fix it and bring the receipt back to the tint installer for a refund of the fix. Does this sound like a good plan to anyone else?

**For those interested, my vetting process:** I started looking for places on the local Tesla FB groups to see who has gotten theirs done before, and who's been recommended. I found an old close friend on there who had theirs done, and recommended a place, so I decided to go to them. When I dropped it off, I talked to the owner and explicitly asked him if he has done 3's in the past, and if he is comfortable doing the windshields on the 3's since others have damaged the electronics by doing so. He reassured me that he has done them before, and that he was comfortable and confident in doing mine without any issues. I'm just frustrated since I'm not sure what else I could have done at this point to prevent this, so this is a **warning** to all of those who are thinking about tinting the windshield, and are just planning to find an experienced installer do it. **It's not worth it!**

TeslaMotors,frustrating,7smuvy,Model 3 delivery dates are getting pushed out again. Source: Tesla customer support,"Sorry for the length of this post. I figured it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to Tesla and this subreddit if I didn‚Äôt provide the entire background story and context.


I am a Model 3 reservation holder and my Tesla account is still currently showing November to January 2018 delivery estimate. This is the already pushed back date from a few months ago when it was initially Oct-Dec 2017. 


I called the Tesla customer support number around December 29 to inquire about my reservation and see if they knew when I might be able to expect a configuration invite. Since it was almost January, and it typically takes 4 weeks for production, I was getting nervous I would not receive my vehicle within January as shown on my account. The Rep I spoke with was very reassuring and told me that I should be expecting the configuration invite any day. He reassured me it was still possible and to keep an eye out.


I let another ~10 days go by and figured I‚Äôd call again since it was now technically impossible for me to receive delivery in January. My ""delivery estimator"" on my account hadn‚Äôt been updated to show anything different. I was worried that maybe I had slipped through the cracks or there was some technical glitch on their side which  wasn‚Äôt allowing me to configure or wasn't updating my delivery estimator to show a proper lead time for when I could expect to receive my car. Another quick call to the Tesla customer support phone number. After discussing with this Rep, he told me the ""delivery estimator"" is not actually when you can expect to receive delivery of the vehicle. He said the ""delivery estimator"" is only for predicting when you‚Äôll be invited to configure the vehicle. I told him that sounded strange and I hadn‚Äôt heard that before. He said (word for word) ""that is actually a common misconception. The delivery estimator is only for predicting when you‚Äôll be invited to configure."" I mean.... no shit its a misconception...it‚Äôs called a delivery estimator. Tesla named it the delivery estimator. It's not like we were trying to read between the lines and assume it was the delivery estimator. That is the name of the tool. My frustrations aside, at least now I felt that I had somewhat confirmed that I would indeed be invited to configure within the month of January. Since that is what the ""delivery estimator (configuration invite estimator)"" was saying.


That brings us to today. I‚Äôve seen postings of another few waves of people getting their configuration invitation and I still hadn‚Äôt received mine. I figured I would go ahead and follow up once again with a quick call the customer support line. After all, it has been nearly 2 years since I pre-ordered this thing and I‚Äôm growing impatient since it feels like trying to hit a moving target. This time the person that I spoke with agreed that obviously I won't be receiving my vehicle in January. She didn't mention anything about the ""delivery estimator / configuration estimator"" tool though. Then she said (and I‚Äôm putting this word for word here): ""**.... doesn‚Äôt look like you‚Äôll be able to be receiving anything in January. Keep checking your account as I know they're working on some updates to the delivery dates here within the next few days. We just have a lot of other people that are also waiting to get their vehicles and we are getting them out as fast as we can.**""


My bottom line is this is a big purchase for a lot of people (myself included). People plan their finances, etc. around trying to time a purchase of this size and it‚Äôs very difficult to not have a solid estimate for when you can expect to receive the vehicle. Obviously, it sucks that they missed their deadlines and they‚Äôre not able to ramp their production as fast as everyone hoped. But I really don't think there is an excuse for waiting until the last week with in three month window only to push the deadline for a second time.  I find it really hard to believe that they were unable to see this 4 weeks ago or six weeks ago. They should have adjusted my delivery estimate window accordingly as early as possible. My second major frustration is the fact that during my second call, they essentially told me that I was wrong for interpreting the delivery estimator as an estimated date for when I can expect delivery. I would like to give the rep who fielded the call the benefit of the doubt and assume that maybe he just didn‚Äôt know what he was talking about. However the way he made the statement sounded extremely confident.  To me it felt more like a PR move because they knew the backlash they would receive if they pushed delivery dates once again. So instead they tried to buy themselves a free four weeks by claiming the delivery estimator isn't predicting delivery, only configuration date. With all this said, my delivery date has not been changed yet. I‚Äôm still hopeful that either I misinterpreted what she was saying to me or she misspoke. Hopefully the delivery estimator/configuration invitation estimator will not be changed again. 


I‚Äôm not happy with the lack of general transparency I‚Äôve experienced, especially as a prospect of buyer. After all, I'm supposed to strap my body inside of one of these things and let it drive me autonomously at 70 mph. There needs to be some type of trust that I have in their abilities to give me reliable information in a timely manner and be transparent about the process. 


**TL;DR:**

* Called Tesla Customer Service
* Was told the delivery estimator is not for estimating delivery. It is only for estimating when you'll be invited to configure. 
* Was told to keep an eye on my Tesla account because updated delivery dates are being published soon",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7smuvy/model_3_delivery_dates_are_getting_pushed_out/,napoda88,51.0,0.9705
TeslaMotors,frustrating,em1e7a,"Rented a Tesla 3, why did supercharger charge slow?","Visiting LA, rented a model 3 long range thru Turo app. As per the rental agreement they want car returned to 91% or greater charge. Before dropping it off at the Turo drop-off near LAX, visited the Santa Monica supercharger. While there was approx 15 min wait for a free supercharger (one of the 10 there was flashing red and not giving a charge). Left the Tesla there for 60 minutes, but only gained 150 miles of charge, and had slowed to 20 kW by the time we needed to drive back.

SOC of charge: remaining miles \~10 miles

Outside temp: 65 F

Driving condition prior to arriving: LA freeway driving for about 50 miles with average speed of say 65 mph.

Supposedly it's supposed to charge faster if it's warm, but all indications should be battery is warm.

While I know supercharging is mostly for road trips, when renting a car I don't exactly have a home charger to use and destination chargers aren't common enough, at least not for this particular visit. I'm a little frustrated at this inconvenience of not being able to quickly charge when needed, especially when superchargers promise 150kw of charging, which should be able to bring the battery pack to 90% in an hour or so",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/em1e7a/rented_a_tesla_3_why_did_supercharger_charge_slow/,Niwrad0,16215.0,0.7886
TeslaMotors,frustrating,7vpxd5,Supercharger etiquette,"Hey fellow Tesla owners,

There's something I'm always sort of curios. If you're charging at a Supercharger site and you see a long lines of other Tesla waiting, do you (perhaps subsconsciously) stop charging before your intended battery percentage so to help reduce the waiting? The longer the wait and the line is, the more uncomfortable I feel and I would just charging more would not be necessary. 

I imagine this would be more of a problem now that there's more Model 3s on the road. Just want to hear what you guys' opinions on this. Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7vpxd5/supercharger_etiquette/,WhyWhatWho,15795.0,-0.1036
TeslaMotors,frustrating,dweudy,I'm tired of glitchy software,"I've owned a Model X since early this year. Test drove a Tesla for the first time, it blew me away, and two weeks later I owned one. I use autopilot all the time, I find it really makes driving relaxing and I do realize that it's not ready for prime time when it comes to ""full"" and I pay full attention while using it.

However I have to say that for a $100,000+ car all the software glitchiness is annoying as hell. It's nothing major, nothing show-stopping, just little annoying things that would not be present in even a $30K car from another manufacturer. Stuff like the screens going completely blank, requiring at least a soft reboot. SiriusXM randomly stopping from working. With the latest update even after I put the car in park, the seatbelt alert comes on when I unbuckle to get out.

Also, I really liked the update where when driving in the right lane and the right road stripe widened for an exit the car would stay to the left. For some reason that update was undone and once again when that happens I seem like a drunk driver, trying to stay in the middle of a double wide lane. The other thing is with adaptive cruise control on in the city (yes, I use it in city driving so I don't have to worry so much about getting popped for a speeding ticket) if the car in front of me goes into the center/turn lane, even when it's fully out of my lane the car slows down aggressively. The other day my wife got yelled at and the finger from a couple of cars that were behind her when this happened since there is no obvious reason for the car to slow. I find myself having to hit the accelerator when this happens.

Anyway, I'm sure I'll get downvoted to hell, but whatever. I love owning a Tesla, but a car at this level should operate without glitches.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,dmqs1g,Nightmare with the Dallas Tesla Body Shop,"If I knew what I know now, I wouldn't have taken my car into the Dallas Tesla Body Shop. 

**Delivery Day**

I picked up my car on 9/11, which was an ordeal in of itself due to the registration not getting completed on time. The delivery specialist told me that the car had a scratch on the bumper and side skirt it from delivery and that they would fix it, but they couldn't at the moment since the body shop people were on vacation or busy until October 11th, she told me to book an appointment through the app. I hopped on the app and was surprised to see many appointment slots in September before October 11 so I booked one of the earlier slots and asked the delivery specialist why she told me I couldn't book until after October 11. She told me that the body shop schedule isn't connected to the app and told me to just trust her, so I did and booked an appointment at 8:30am on October 14th. 

**Bringing my Car to the Tesla Service Center**

I show up on the 14th at 8:30am on the dot to my scheduled appointment time. When I bring the car in, they tell me that even though the body shop is Tesla's they're a separate entity, so they need to find the body shop people to check me in and they tell me to wait in the waiting room. 

After 30 minutes of waiting, I go check-in on what's taking so long since I have to get to work. The service people are trying to contact someone at the body shop, but the person who's responsible hasn't shown up to work yet. They tell me she was stuck in traffic and another gentleman checked my car in and said once the body shop representative shows up they'll call me. I ask for a loaner which they said that they don't have any so they gave me $100 Uber credits.

A couple hours later I get a text from the body shop representative saying they've checked in my car. I would later find out that this text thread is my only line of communication with the body shop. 

**Life without a car**

I had messaged the body shop if I would be getting $100 Uber credit everyday to which I never got a response to, so I assumed that I would. Wrong. The Uber credit they gave me expired at midnight the day they took my car into service. When I woke up the next day I didn't have a car or Uber credit so I called in to the ""service center"" which turns out you can't contact directly. I spoke with a representative to ask if they can grant me the credit, but since my car was in the body-shop and that it's a separate entity they said that the body-shop would have to get me the credit and they weren't able to get in contact with the body-shop. 

After waiting awhile, I got a text with Uber credits that would last me until 10/20. However, the body-shop later responded to me and said the body-work was estimated to be completed by next Wednesday (10/23), so I followed up with a request to extend the Uber credits or get a loaner to 10/23 since 10/20 was a weekend and I knew I wouldn't be able to contact anyone on the weekend and I didn't wake up Monday morning without a way to get to work. 

I found out very quickly that Ubering everywhere is extremely inconvenient. It was hard to be on time and there are some sketchy drivers/cars on their platform. This is no fault of Tesla's though. 

I follow-up over 2 days to get a response on extending the credits or getting a loaner, until finally they decided to give me an enterprise rental which covered up to $45 a day. From the receipt on the enterprise rental I found out that the Tesla Body Shop is actually a Caliber Collision which would make sense since it's right behind the Tesla service center. 

In those 2 days prior to getting the rental car I found out very quickly that Ubering everywhere is extremely inconvenient. It was hard to be on time and there are some sketchy drivers/cars on their platform. This is no fault of Tesla's though. 

**Trying to get Updates**

The most frustrating part is the communication with the body shop. There's no direct number to contact the service center and no direct number to contact the body shop. The body shop was also extremely slow on responding to the text thread to the point that I would have to call the ""service line"" to have someone at Tesla send the body-shop a message since even they didn't have a direct line. I had to do this many times to finally elicit a response from the body-shop. 

At one point I had called into the Tesla support hotline to ask if there was anyway to contact the body shop directly and they told me no and told me to just go to the service center in person if I wanted an update that badly. 

**Picking up my Car**

Since I was out of town on Wednesday I tried picking up the car on Thursday (10/24). I was excited since I could finally drive my car again and I was relived to know that my car didn't get destroyed by the tornado on 10/20. 

When I arrive it turns out that the people at the body shop weren't around so I sat in the waiting room. The service guy finds my car and gives me key so I go outside to check the work done on the car. 

The original scratch on the rear bumper was resolved so I was relieved. There were still some scratches on the underside of the side skirt, but I was reluctant to let that stop me from driving home since the side skirt will get scratches on it eventually. 

When I opened the door, I immediately said to myself, what the \*\*\*\*. When I dropped off my car, it was about a month old and the seats had that nice matte texture of new leather. What I saw was that the entire interior of the car looked like it had been slathered with a layer of grease. Everything was shiny, the rear seats had these oily hand prints on the seat. It looked as if they somehow aged the interior 5 years in the span of a week. I honestly thought they had somehow replaced all my seats with some old ones. 

As I continue to inspect the car, I noticed that they sprayed the grease or whatever the ""detailing"" agent they used on every orifice of the car including the rear AC vents. I then discovered that they punctured a interior pleather trim. 

When I checked the trunk I noticed that the trunk was completely misaligned to the point that the driver side of the trunk lid was touching the bottom bumper and causing blemishes in the paint.

I told the service technician and they brought out a manager. The manager promised to resolve all of these issues, but it was going to take additional time. I asked for a loaner vehicle and they still denied me that request even though someone had just returned a loaner. They loaded me some Uber credits and sent me on my way. The good news is the service technician gave me their email to which they've been very responsive to so I really appreciated that. 

I'm honestly pretty concerned that I'm just going to keep finding more issues every time I attempt to pick my car up. 

**Conclusion** 

I would say that taking your Tesla to the Tesla Body Shop should be the very last resort since as it is right now the disconnect between Tesla Service Center and Tesla Body Shop is going to cause you huge headaches. 

They need to work out how to integrate the body shop into their service center so that communication and service can be more consistent.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/dmqs1g/nightmare_with_the_dallas_tesla_body_shop/,CureTBA,6921.0,0.9976
TeslaMotors,frustrating,bv7n2o,Did we get a lemon? To service or return within 7 day period?,"We picked up our Model 3 AWD YESTERDAY. On the drive home, the touchscreen blacked out and then restarted. Okay, I research this and see it can happen occasionally. Then, this morning we went to drive it to work and it wouldn‚Äôt start at all, despite having 190 miles of charge on it. 

There were three error messages:
‚Äú12v battery requires service‚Äù
‚Äú12v power reduced‚Äîvehicle may shut down unexpectedly‚Äù
‚ÄúCar needs service‚Äîcar may not start‚Äù

I have requested service through the Tesla app, and I will be calling dealer as soon as they open. The reason I am positing is because I have a few questions I was hoping you all might have perspective on:

Is this normal? If not, did I get a lemon? I presume they will want to repair, but I am worried that things will continue to go wrong and then we will be outside our 7 day return window.

Edited to update: Thanks to all who replied.  It was very helpful to get a perspective on how common this issue might be (my take away:not uncommon, probably not a huge deal, but possibly concerning if they don‚Äôt respond appropriately). 

We were further disappointed in the lackluster response by the dealer. It took us three phone calls over a four period (each promising someone would call us back within the hour) to get a response. That response was that we should drive the car into the SC (over an hour away), which was impossible as the car would not start (and even if it would, would have been frustrating as they should take care of a brand new car). Finally got them to agree to send out a tow truck and a loaner, so we will see how this goes. 

I would have expected a manager (or anyone, really) to call us back and say ‚Äúwe‚Äôre on it! We will take care of this.‚Äù  Going to give them a few days, but right now I see this as two strikes on the car. It might all be okay in the end, but if there is another issue, then we will ask for another car.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/bv7n2o/did_we_get_a_lemon_to_service_or_return_within_7/,PreviousDifficulty,8256.0,0.7578
TeslaMotors,frustrating,husp80,Strangest Delivery Experience,"I got a call last Thursday from Tesla telling me my Model Y is here at the Ottawa service centre ready for delivery, we scheduled to pick up the vehicle at 1 pm today.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,fb5keb,Autosteer speed restriction,"Is anyone else frustrated by the seemingly arbitrary ""autosteer speed restricted"" message that prohibits increasing the TACC speed on certain stretches of road when autosteer is enabled?  For example, there is one road which I drive on for my daily commute where the first half is speed restricted to 50 mph, which is fine in this case, but then the second half drops to 40 which is too low for the traffic flow there.     At that point I have to press the accelerator to get back up to 50.

It obviously isn't a technical limitation because autosteer continues to work fine while I'm manually accelerating.  It seems to be loosely based on the posted speed limits, but not always.  So why is Tesla trying to enforce their own custom global dataset of speed limits (but only when autosteer is enabled)?  

To make the matter more annoying, it isn't really possible to know if your TACC is set to the max speed without scrolling the wheel button and seeing if it displays the message.  I haven't really seen anyone commenting on this before so am I the only one who finds this inconvenient?",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/fb5keb/autosteer_speed_restriction/,ComCypher,167372.0,-0.8742
TeslaMotors,frustrating,ejmq8b,Myriad of Issues with 3SR+ in First 3 Months. Recourse?,"After years of following Tesla, I took delivery of my 3SR+ at end of Q3 (Sept 27th). During delivery, 2 issues were found (Cracked Windshield and scratched headlight) and a subsequent service center appointment was made to rectify.

When I got to the service center, they only had 1 on record (Windshield) and I produced the paper from delivery to show both, but they didn't have the part in, so that was another service center visit.

Since then, I've found many QA issues with my 3SR+ and, while Tesla has attempted to fix each one, the recurrence of one in particular (Trunk) has moved beyond frustrating into ridiculously time consuming for a new car.

Since Delivery I've had the following issues:

1. Windshield Replaced (Visit 1 of 5 - 10/16 Service Center)
2. Steering Wheel Squeak noted - but not fixed (Visit 1 of 5 - 10/16 Service Center)
3. Headlight Replaced (Visit 2 of 5 - 11/11 Service Center)
4. Steering Wheel Squeak - fixed - was wiring harness rubbing steering column (Visit 2 of 5 - 11/11 Service Center) 
5. Left front QP rubbing against frame - rust developing - fixed (Visit 2 of 5 - 11/11 Service Center)
6. Drivers mirror glass replaced - bubble developed under finish (Visit 3 of 5 - 12/4 Mobile Service)
7. Frunk corner was higher than body - fit issue - fixed (Visit 3 of 5 - 12/4 Mobile Service)
8. Trunk rubbing on body - fit issue - fixed (Visit 3 of 5 - 12/4 Mobile Service)
9. Rear Door Seal - fit issue - fixed (Visit 3 of 5 - 12/4 Mobile Service)
10. Trunk Seal - after adjusting for trunk rubbing, now seal lets in water to trunk when raining - attempted fix (Visit 4 of 5 - 12/30 Service Center)
11. Battery Popping - known service bulletin - fixed (Visit 4 of 5 - 12/30 Service Center)
12. Trunk Seal - Rained today again, water intrusion still present (Visit 5 of 5 - scheduled for 1/20 at Service Center)

While all of these things above have been covered under warranty and a loaner has been available each time, I just want a car without issues! 

The recurrence of issues (fitment)/not fixing the first time is what has me bothered. This seems extremely inefficient for Tesla as a whole. My brother got a 3SR+ a few days after mine and while he did have one issue with the rear door seals, hasn't had nearly the issues I have.

My question is this - is there any recourse for the time spent shuttling this car to/from the SC or number of issues related to the car itself? (Such as an extension of free supercharging, lemon law, etc) 

Thankfully I live close, but I have never in my life had a car that has required so much service and this is coming from someone who consistently drives 10+ year old cars before this one!

I do love the car and it's easily the best one I ever have driven, but I want to ensure my rose colored glasses aren't blinding me to accepting a sub-par car and/or service experience.

Or am I making a mountain out of a molehill?

TeslaMotors,frustrating,9fut2f,[Discussion] How exactly am I supposed to buy a used car from Tesla?,"I have had my eye on a Model S for a while now, and am finally ready to pull the trigger.  Call me old fashioned but I refuse to buy new due to that day-one depreciation; I've been buying off-lease cars my entire life.

First off, it appears the pictures Tesla uses on their site are stock photos.  How do I know what I am about to spend $60,000 on?  No pictures seems lazy, but not the end of the world, it says I can call or email asking for pictures.

I called the number on the listing, and after a lengthy hold time, a frustrated sounding phone rep told me she has zero information about used cars, I have to click the ""callback"" link on the listing.  So now in addition to no photos, Tesla has a bogus phone number on their listing?

OK fine, I clicked the link and filled out the form to get a callback.  The form said expect a call within one to two business days.  A week later I have received no call.  Put in a request for a call on a different listing, no call.  Put in a third request today, but I think I see a pattern here.

I guess I could put down the $2500 deposit and just refuse the car if it's in bad shape.  Except I have no idea where the car is, as the listing doesn't say? What if it's across the country, I'm supposed to buy airline tickets to check out a car?  According to the terms on the payment page, if I don't roll the deposit over to a different car in 72 hours I forfeit $2500.  Do people really take this risk?

This whole thing has basically put me off from owning a Tesla.  If they're this unattentive and disorganized when trying to sell me a car, I shudder to think how it will be once they have my money.

Am I missing something here?  

If you read this far thanks, and apologies if I sound frustrated... it's just in 20 years I've never had this difficult of a time trying to have a car company take my money.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9fut2f/discussion_how_exactly_am_i_supposed_to_buy_a/,bored_manager,9824.0,-0.99
TeslaMotors,frustrating,c9u8dj,Is it worth buying a Model 3?,"Obviously this is a biased community, but I would like some input from current owners.

I have a 17y/o car, and it needs about $400 in repairs. I have been repairing it somewhat frequently, and I am getting tired of putting more money into this car because it is just starting to feel like a money sink.

I have *really* wanted a Tesla for a long time now, but they are certainly expensive. I can afford one on a 5 year loan, but it just seems like such a big investment when I could buy a car for nearly a third of the price. My other concern is access to charging stations. My apartment does not have any stations and is unwilling to put one in the garage for me. There are about 12 charging sites within a mile of me, but I don't know how available they are because I live in a large metro area. There are also no charging sites at or near my place of work.

I have been just trying to tackle in my head if it is truly worth it to spend $24k more for a car on a 5 year loan compared to paying off a car on a 2 year loan. 

Is a Tesla really worth the money? I make good enough money that it is an option, but not good enough money that I could pay it off as soon as I would like to.

The other crux is that I recently got promoted, but I have no idea what my new pay is going to be because of paperwork for the contract. I have already been working the job for a few weeks now which is frustrating for me (I am still getting the previous pay until paperwork is finished). If I knew what my new pay would be and if it was good enough, I would be gung-ho about the decision, but I am struggling to wait because of delivery time and the need for a new car. Fortunately, my roommate and I can carpool for the time being.

Edit: I was also looking online at used options. It seems like the resale value for these cars is pretty good. I could always turn around and sell it if I really wasn't happy which does make me feel a bit better about purchasing one.

Edit 2: Thanks for the input guys. I think I am going to (sadly) hold off on a Tesla for now. As much as I would like one, the inability to charge at my own convenience is probably the biggest reason I won't go for one right now. I can always buy a cheaper car for now and sell it later if I want to make the switch.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/c9u8dj/is_it_worth_buying_a_model_3/,Heath776,50388.0,0.9791
TeslaMotors,frustrating,fhsu7z,Tesla replacement parts and service issues. My experience.,"I am a huge fan of Tesla and Elon, but wanted to detail my frustration with after sales availability of spare parts.

Recently I was involved in accident where a young driver drove through a stop sign and hit my car. Unfortunately this happens and my car was sent to the authorised Tesla repairer, which was an hour away. 

The repairer was on the ball, but they had to wait up to a week after placing a order with Tesla to receive the ETA on the replacement parts. Even with this wait the repairer had to contact Tesla multiple times to receive the confirmation.

Eventually after two weeks all parts were confirmed with ETA's applied. This was OK, now I had the information to make a decision on a temporary vehicle while i waited.

Fast forward to five weeks later and now i get a call from the repairer stating that Tesla has updated the final part (which was due in the next 5 days) to back-ordered with an unknown delivery status. My car was due for pickup in 6 days.

Now I can understand issues can arise but this does seem like Tesla's systems are failing them. Considering the airfreight and delivery time to our location in Australia I would have expected this part to be shipped on the day or before Tesla informed the Repairer.

The fact that a part, which is still used on every Model S is now not available and with no new delivery date is very hard to believe and is very frustrating.

I have heard many stories about replacement parts on this forum and now share in their frustration.

I have had many dealings with Tesla and my personal opinion is that sales and service side of the Tesla business needs some focus ( Contrary to Elon's opinion). Elon has many positives which drives this company forward regardless of the sales and service, but Tesla could be so much more if they made improvements here.

Recently I purchased a Model 3 Performance and while I visited the Showroom and dealt with customer service to make my order. This was a reasonably fast procedure, the sales staff were not that knowledgeable nor were focused on making a sale, which is completely fine as this is how Tesla wants it to be. Nowhere through the process were we told about any additions or given the opportunity to by any accessories, which we wanted to buy.

On pickup, we asked about the phone USB cables and were told that we had to order them, so we went home to do it online. Quickly we found that we cannot order them online, we would have to order them from the Telsa showroom. We phoned and waited 20 minutes for the accessory to be arranged, but the guy had to call us back and let us know. A few days later we called again to get an update, to which we were told they have been ordered in and they will let us know when they arrive. 2 weeks later we call the store to check and eventually we were told that they have just arrived and that we can come down to pick them up, but only Monday - Friday, which i guess is ok since they are a service department next to the showroom.

We went to the store and waited 45 minutes for them to find the parts and then do a manual card payment to buy the iPhone cable. This cable is sold by Tesla for $14 AUD and it comes with  2 cables a USB C and a Iphone cable. The labour cost to sell and provide this cable to us would have been at a loss. ( phone calls and time we spent in store). Tesla would have made less of a loss if they had included the cable with the car, or they should have priced the cable correctly. An iphone cable in Australia is sold for $30aud, and Tesla could have charge $40aud for the cable without too much complaints. Additionally Tesla could have had a better sales experience and let us purchase this at the time of sale and the other items my wife wanted, but they have proven too hard to sort.

Tesla, in my opinion ( which may not be right) is leaving too much money on the table. Selling the accessories for the car at the right price would help to offset the sales teams. Likewise replacement parts for repairs should have a higher markup than when used on finished cars (which I would expect to be the case) and as a result shipping replacement accessories to repairers should be a lucrative business to the benefit of Tesla. Even increasing the replacement parts by another 10% would not be too much of an issue.

What is bad for Tesla is the reputation they are getting in the repair market for the inability to supply replacement parts or accessories in a timely manner, which should not be the case.

I will continue to wait for the replacement part as this is beyond my control.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/fhsu7z/tesla_replacement_parts_and_service_issues_my/,nidanjosh,3502.0,-0.8953
TeslaMotors,frustrating,amdon3,Not having the best Tesla buying experience,"Wanted to share as I am but frustrated with Tesla at the moment. 

In the market for a used Tesla and working with a sales associate from Tesla via email and phone. 

We go back and forth on about ten cars because they seem to sell within hours, and for me, it‚Äôs a bit hard to place a deposit on a car sight unseen. 

Anyways I find the right car, confirm the VIN with the sales associate and place a deposit. I am stoked for all of one day until I get a message from my insurance asking me to re-verify the VIN. 

At this point I realize the sales associate reserved me the wrong car, and surprise surprise, this car is $2k more than the one I had explicitly asked for. The cars are almost identical in terms of mileage, and features. 

The sales associate has been ducking me for two days. I emailed three times and called and left voicemails three times because I am unsure how to move forward. Not trying to be that guy, but I sent a final email asking my delivery support person if my sales guy was out on pto or if I could talk to his supervisor and suddenly this associate calls me. (Seems like an odd coincidence). 

Finally I talk to him and he tells me the car I wanted to reserve has been sold but that he will work to make it right. No contact beyond that.

I read on here about everyone‚Äôs experiences and I can‚Äôt help but think I am an exception? Has anyone else had issues like this? 

Btw, would like to give a major shout out to my delivery associate. She has been the only person responsive at Tesla and has been going above and beyond to help track down the sales side to get me help.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,dsjbql,Have to send a HUGE Cudos out to Tesla and the Portland Oregon Group.,"In the world that you really only hear people talking about bad, I have to make this post.

My GF and I are very avid online researchers when looking for products and reviews made by people. We purchased our Tesla Model 3 (super base model) about 2 months ago. Absolutely LOVE the car and I pretty much have drank the entire pitcher of CoolAid regarding Tesla and Elon's stance in the world.

We went to our closest Tesla ""Dealer"" which was about an hour away. We had a test drive scheduled. Walked into the store in the mall. Took about a minute before we had about 3 people asking us who we had an appointment with. We were directed to our ""sales"" person who asked what car we were interested in. Grabbed keys and we were on the road in less than 5 minutes. Sales person asked if we liked the vehicle and now my GF and I looked at each other and felt the, ""Here comes the sales pitch and pressure."" We hesitantly said, yes.

Went back to the desk (already had decided we wanted one in reality). Sales person sat down, took about three pieces of information and said have a great night. If you are interested just go to this web site ([Tesla.com](https://Tesla.com)) and login and complete the transaction. UHHHHH, wait what? You aren't doing a 4 Square paper, showing us what payments will be if we do this or dance on our heads? You mean, you aren't trying to sell us additional warranties, upgrade the interior? Wait, what.  She even gave us two coffee cards for the neighboring coffee shop just for coming in and driving this amazing car.

So, ok.... We are driving back home and the GF is on her phone completing the application on line. By the time we were 1/2 home, she was done and we had a delivery date of three weeks out. This was a Saturday.

By the time we finished the rest of our drive, it was updated and the car would be delivered in a week on a Friday after 5:00 PM.

Woke up the next morning and had an email asking if we could come in on Wednesday sometime to take delivery of the car and they were very apologetic that it was an earlier schedule than what we were told.  UHHHH, wait, you are sorry it was earlier and could possible be an inconvenience?

Of course we took delivery as soon as we could.. Showed up in the showroom at the time where we met the delivery specialist. Our car was sitting alone in the very neat and clean showroom. Of course the Red Tesla wall, with the T and words Tesla behind it. Car sitting on a large red carpet. Pretty much only thing missing was a HUGE red Bow... He went through everything with us. How to pair the phones, cards, where all the controls were. Examination of the vehicle exterior, places to look for defects, things to look for. We didn't feel rushed at all. Actually we were in more of a hurry than he was. We didn't see anything wrong with the car that we couldn't live with, which my expectations were pretty high actually. I think there was a streak on the side window from someone not cleaning the window perfect, but that was about it.

So, we took delivery and started out driving home. No sooner than we got home, press park on the car than the sales person called asking if everything was ok? If everything met our satisfaction. She also said she had someone come in that didn't have a referral and asked if we minded her putting an extra 1000 miles charge on and said he was refereed by us.

So, since that day it was really close to the end of the month. Three days after we took possession, an incentive came out that if you took delivery of the car between X date and X date, you would get two years free charging. So, we considered calling our sales person and giving them the riot act of hey, we can just return this car and get a new one to make that date and get two years free.  GF and I went back and forth on this and decided against it because there really wasn't anything close enough to make the charging worth it.

Two days later our sales person calls us and said she saw the incentive and has already contacted Tesla about getting us into the program. Then the next day she called and said she had it all taken care of and we should see that on our account within a week. - REALLY - they called US about this?  DAMN!

Then, just the other day we were in an accident. Someone rear-ended us. Nothing major at all, but still frustration. The only real damage was a scuff to the bumper and reflector. Other driver's insurance covered everything. BUT, the service there was amazing also.

GF had been doing research if we should go to Tesla or not. Read a lot of horrible stories of how the work was crappy, how the paint didn't match, how it took forever to get done. How they over charged people, how they didn't give loaners and just over and over she was reading bad stuff. Anxiety kicked in and she was freaking out.

I called the service center where we took delivery. They put me in touch with a specialist there in the shop. We texted and emailed back and forth. He provided a quote for me, new bumper, re-align sensors, new reflector. $1,200.00.  UMm, that is pretty good actually. 

Scheduled a date and time. Showed up, drove into a very clean shop area. Red carpets lined where the cars were parking and letting people out. He met us and opened the door. Said he was very sorry for what happened to the car and will be ensuring it is done correctly.  Really, this is just a low end Model 3, not a high end S or X.

Anyway, walked to his terminal. asked if we were going to wait in the lobby or come back later.  HUH? He said, we should be done in about an hour and a half with your car. We hadn't planned on staying in Portland for that long and had to get to work. So, we received a loaner Model S.

From the time we pulled through the doors of the service center to the time we drove off the lot was about 15 minutes. 

When we picked the car up, they pulled it into the light, looked over the repair with us. Left us alone to talk about it and pick at it if we wanted. He even suggested we look very closely before making payment and taking delivery. The repair job was amazing. The body lines were perfectly matched, no extra space on one side or anything.

Looked over the receipt when it was emailed. They basically checked everything they could check while in the shop, Firmware, topped off windshield washer fluid, checked tire dept, checked brakes, checked all sensors, reviewed vehicle logs, etc..

So, this LONG butt post is really just to say what a GREAT experience I have had from the Tesla Group in Portland Oregon. If any of you know them, pass this to them. I have told them personally, but a public statement is also nice.  I don't know what experiences others have had, but this just re-emphasizes how committed Tesla is to the ""Tesla Experience"".",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/dsjbql/have_to_send_a_huge_cudos_out_to_tesla_and_the/,iDad_D4,986.0,0.9888

TeslaMotors,frustrating,9q2pdg,Conclusion after 2000km driven 99% on AP1: I f.. hate the nagging,"Might sound like a rant but it isn‚Äôt. It might sound like a first world problem but isn‚Äôt. I just paid a lot of cash for this car and I want to be able to make use of the functionality I paid for, without having to constantly babysit the steering wheel (I know, that‚Äôs called driving). 

Since last update, the nagging of AP is really frustrating to the point I am not using it anymore.

I am driving mostly on German Autobahn at maximum speed allowed by AP1 which is 150km/h (90mi/h) with my hands ALWAYS on the steering wheel.

I am keeping my hands at 7 & 5 o‚Äôclock on the steering wheel (that‚Äôs how I drive most comfortable) but the weight of my hands is not enough to stop the AP nagging every 10-12 seconds. Also keeping my hand on top of the steering wheel at 12 o‚Äôclock doesn‚Äôt help. On a road trip of 2000km that takes about 28hours to complete, that‚Äôs a lot of unnecessary nagging every 10 seconds, it just becomes less tiring and annoying to just drive myself rather than moving the steering wheel left and right just to make the AP happy.

Another thing I can‚Äôt bend my brain around is: Why do I need to lose my AP if I drove 1km/h harder than the AP limit? What is the logic? Sometimes I need to floor it a bit so I can complete my overtake and make room for a faster car coming from behind. This maneuver gets me to 151km/h and always renders the AP useless until I find a gas station to stop and start again. Why not deactivate it for 1 or 2 minutes? Why the drastic punishment?

Can we somehow express our group opinion about this directly to Elon? I am sure I am not the only one frustrated with this.

All these aside Autopilot is by far the best and most underrated feature of this car.

Edit: Managed to cut the nags in half by changing the steering mode from standard to comfort.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,d6kcch,New M3 delivered. Can't trigger Assisted Lane Change on Auto Pilot.,"New M3 delivered yesterday, but I can't seem to engage assisted lane change on Auto Pilot when I trigger turn signal during AP mode. My sales rep told me this feature was included, and I even did a test drive on a vehicle that had exactly same option and had assisted lane change working fine.   I called my sales rep, and he said maybe I need to drive 100mi ish to calibrate until this feature shows up. Is this true?   I would be quite frustrated if this feature was left out somehow.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,b0mnor,Is it reasonable for me to be seriously pissed at Elon just now?,"I am a huge Musk fan and have tended to put him on a pedestal over the past few years.  

Some of the stuff he has pulled at Tesla lately has got me concerned though... he just wasn't coming across as the safest pair of hands for what I always believed would be the most important car company ever.

Anyhow - I was so stoked to hear about the Tesla price cuts to both the model 3 and the autopilot features... I have been waiting a long time to finally get my tesla, so as soon as i heard news of the reduction i put a deposit down for ¬£1000 (intending to get the standard range plus with FSD).  

How incredibly frustrating has it been for me as a UK buyer to watch this debacle unfold over the past few days however?  From a high of seeing a price i could afford, putting down my deposit and waiting happily to place my final order.,.. within a week it has all been thrown under a bus.  

As a UK buyer I can't order this week (nobody can) so we just have to watch by the sidelines as the car we put money down for suddenly shoots up in price and the only solution presented (order it now) is not available to us.  

It looks like a crazy way to run a company, and a crappy way to treat its customers full stop - but for folk in the UK it is a particularly hard pill to swallow.  

If they let me put down a bigger deposit and secure the car at the lower price then that would have been something... but nope... just got to watch this crazy rollercoaster ride play out.  

TL:DR Feeling pretty pissed about the Elon's fickle ways with Tesla - and being in the UK makes it even worse. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/b0mnor/is_it_reasonable_for_me_to_be_seriously_pissed_at/,xdcthedoc,1062.0,-0.6387
TeslaMotors,frustrating,d8fp6b,"Worst Customer Support Ever, Promotional Deals Backfiring.","I've called seven times today to try and get a clear cut answer or help and I've been getting the run around and I'm just tired of it. I can't take it anymore, not to mention the attitude...

The Story so far.

Went happily into my local Tesla store in the galleria, I live in Houston Texas.

Tested the car, great car.

Asked about the 2 Year Free Supercharging was told that if the car gets shipped before the 30th I'd get it.Told him how come I don't get it when I put the down payment before the 30th, he stated that their policy is delivery before the 30th. I'm like well if you can't guarantee me that I get before the 30th why would I rush to buy the car...

I mention something about comping the white interior and he was like yea I can do that for you but you will lose your 2 Free Year Supercharging chance. I said ok give me the white and black interior which costs 1000 for free. He said ok, select partial black interior and I'll fix it for you to get the discount.

I do all my stuff online get ready to pay and notice the partial black was changed to partial white with the added 1000 not discounted.

So here begins my journey of being given the runaround.

Call up my Tesla Sales Rep in Houston, he says he has to get his manager to approve the discount but that I should go ahead and buy (haha no...).

Call Tesla in California, they basically tell me to call Tesla Service Center in Houston, they basically tell me to contact my local sales rep that sold me the car so I do.  Woman that picks up says they don't handle that that the Sales Team in california does, I tell her that they looped me back to her, she budges and listens a bit and says she will look into and call me back. Yeah right...

Call again and ask to speak to a manager at 4:00 pm, manager is out.

End up arguing with this person who tells me all the folks online who claim to get the 2 free upgrades are confused, or misinformed, no one at the store can offer that or do anything like that, my best bet is to just buy the car and hope I get a discount from being offered a ground floor car.

Call my sales rep mobile number, says he isn't working but what is wrong. Explain to him again the situation about how it frustrating to hear other getting discounts but I can't get one. He says he isn't at work so can't help me but that he will call first thing in the morning.

I try via online chat to see what they say and they say they will have their specialist contact me.

A specialist contacted me while I was writing this and said the same thing as another rep,  that online sites are wrong that he has got it right. The only thing I can get is 2 year free supercharging if I get it before the 30th or maybe if they offer me a ground floor car (which he wasn't clear on what the conditions would have to be to get that offer) that has miles I could get a car cheaper that way but that there was no other way to get any upgrades at a discount or free.

So that is a summary of my experience, lost of detail left out but I'm too worn out from the whole experience to recall everything right now.  


EDIT: Looks like they changed their tune and cracked down on it because Sales Rep were abusing it. And since I'm doing this purchase late I'm not going to be able to get the deals.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,btm6bp,A Tesla virgin's first impressions,"I was finally able to rent a model 3 for a week. I've never been in one, and since I live in the south-east, I've only even seen one since they have come out. Truth be told, I've never been in ANY Tesla. I flew into LAX and was able to finally find a rental for less than the price of a mortgage payment. I was excited to have my first Tesla experience. 

Quality
Getting in the car, it felt a LOT like getting in an Accord. My initial though was ""this isn't a $50-$60k car"". The leather felt cheap to me, more like vinyl. They were still nice, just not as nice as other cars in that price range. (One caveat here, I also have the same opinion about Lexus' leather.) The seat comfort was nice and we had zero cramping at all with the long drives. Plenty of legroom in the front seats! Trunk space was a little smaller than expected, but everything fit after playing some Tetris. 

Driving
This was the part that impressed me the most. Can't say enough good things about the drive. Acceleration was 'just ok' until I understood what chill mode was and took it off (lol). Then the pep and instant thrust was there and impressive even at 70mph. Ride and steering was nice and tight, it felt like a great sedan sports car. I became used to the lack of dash and center screen quickly. Didn't really care for looking to the side just to see my speed, but whatever. At least it is in the top left corner. Autopilot was extremely impressive and easy to use. Just the speed-sensitive cruise control was fantastic as it would still come to a stop and accelerate behind others at stop lights. 

Charging
This part is my deal killer. I went to charge at a supercharger when I still had about 80 miles left on the car. I was expecting the 75-150kw, so I figured 30-60 min would fill me up. Nope, came back to the car to find it charging at 25kw. It still needs a lot more time that I didn't have. Half of the charging ports were empty too. I wondered if there was something wrong with that charger, so I quickly tried moving to the other end of the charging line, but it also charged at the same rate. I left frustrated that I would have to come back when I had more time. The following day, I woke up early and I went back to the same supercharger. Plugging in on two separate ports both allowed me to charge at a little over 30 kilowatts. I figured I was doing something wrong, but I had no idea why it was charging so slow. I stayed long enough to get a little bit of a charge, but again left frustrated and figured there must be something wrong with that supercharger. A few days later, I was ready for another long drive and went to a different supercharger this time. I arrived to find that I was the only person that the entire place, so I figured it was going to be as fast as possible. I plugged in and had a roaring 32 kilowatt charge rate. At this point, I figure if the charging is this unpredictable, I lose all interest in owning an EV. I only have limited time to get back to the airport have to alter my plans because the car won't charge as fast as I figured. I quickly tried a second port and it charged at exactly the same rate.

Summary 
I'll never buy one of these (or any EV) as my only car until the field charging gets better. Even at a supercharger, they just aren't prevalent enough without it being a special deal to go charge your car, and if the charging rates aren't that predictable, then it's just not a 'dependable' car for me for road trips. Considering how well autopilot works, this would be the car I would WANT to use on road trips. As always, YMMV, but for me, the current charging aspect alone is what kills it for me. I can't charge at home either because I live in a condo. I know battery technology will only get better, along with the charging speed and charging stations.

For the model 3, generally speaking, I would personally say that it's a little overpriced to me but still a nice car. Nothing other than the instant acceleration and autopilot stood out, but those two features are just amazing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/btm6bp/a_tesla_virgins_first_impressions/,tayl428,23240.0,0.9744
TeslaMotors,frustrating,9nw5u3,Model 3 Purchase Complaints,"Alright, so this is somewhat of a rant post, but I would really like to hear if I'm justified for feeling this way too.  

TLDR: Got a free upgrade from Tesla, had to revert the upgrade, have had 2 incorrect delivery dates on my account and 2 incorrect VIN numbers and misinformation through the whole thing.  My delivery specialist has no idea what she's doing.  Am I the asshole for being upset?

I purchased my Model 3, long range, rear wheel drive, black with aero rims in mid September, and since then Tesla has bounced me around every which way.  About a week after purchase, i received an email confirming my upgrade to sport rims, which I did not do or authorize, so I called Tesla and they told me that it was a free gift.  I'm thinking to myself that this is pretty cool, but the invoice doesn't reflect the credit, the price of my car had gone up $1500.  I end up receiving an email from my delivery specialist for something unrelated and I ask about this.  She says that she's never heard of that and that I must have made the change to my order (which I certainly did not do.)  We reverted the change, but by the time that she reverted it, I already had a VIN number for my car.  Two days later (on a Sunday), I get an email confirming my delivery for THE FOLLOWING DAY, at the WRONG ADDRESS.  I email my delivery specialist, but she doesn't respond until Tuesday and she says that was a mistake and it was a 'fake' delivery appointment that should have just been behind the scenes.  Later that week, my order change processes back to the aero wheels and I get a new VIN number, followed by a new delivery appointment a few days later, still to the wrong address.  I email my delivery specialist again and she doesn't respond until after the specified delivery day, once again telling me that it was a 'fake' appointment and I shouldn't have seen it.  Two days later my account is updated again and I no longer have a VIN number or a delivery appointment, but the original credit for $1500, for the rims that I no longer have, hits my account.

I am so frustrated by this whole process.  For a $50,000 car, Tesla should have top notch custom service.  This whole run-around of fake delivery dates, not responding to emails, and the original change to my order are ridiculous.  If they are going to give me a free upgrade, they should mark that in the account, or in the email confirming the change, and their delivery specialists should CERTAINLY be able to know what's going on.  All I know now is that if they remove the $1500 credit because I had to revert the rims, I will be extremely angry.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9nw5u3/model_3_purchase_complaints/,kevin63857,2523.0,-0.3057

- Bluetooth music management on screen

- Spotify integration 

- turn off signal after completing an autopilot lane change. 

- save climate settings immediately. Car will forget the last settings you had before exiting the vehicle, and will revert to the one prior. It's non sense.

I had yet to finalize the financing and insurance and needed at least one week to get everything together.  I was able to actually talk to somebody in the sales department at the SC and they told me they couldn't hold the VIN the extra week, but I would be assigned one the next week.  I also live 2.5 hours away from the delivery center and need to coordinate with work seeing as they could only offer a weekday delivery date. Coming up on the new delivery date (Aug 1) I had no VIN and couldn't get a hold of anybody (had to escalate via live chat) until the day before my new scheduled delivery date were they told me they only had a car with about 350ish miles on it.  I could take it or I could wait for a new one.  The delivery specialist suggested I wait for the new one.  I agreed and now I'm waiting.

It's now August 21 and I have yet to be reassigned a VIN and have trouble getting in touch with anybody at Tesla.  Is there a better way to talk to somebody besides just trying to leave voicemails?  I'm also guessing it's just a waiting game at this point to?  My loan is only good until the 8/24 and I was told by the delivery specialist I would have a car before then.   My bank has told me it won't be a big deal to reapply, but it's just frustrating addition to the process.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,8om8sp,Toronto International Center Delivery Delay,"I will preface this post by saying that I have always been and still am very pro-life Tesla. I have just been incredibly disappointed by my experience.

I have had my delivery book for June 5th for about 3 weeks now.  I have been back and forth with Tesla on all the financing and payment details many times without much issue.  

This evening around 6:30 pm I got a call from a local Toronto Tesla rep saying that unfortunately my delivery must be delayed until Saturday as my car has not yet arrived due to shipping delays.

I explained to the rep that I was on the phone today with Tesla HQ confirming payment amounts and details and no one gave me any indication of the delay.  I had also arranged to take the day off work, my wife did as well.  But the worst is that I sold my car this morning in anticipation of tomorrow's delivery.  I am now without a car for the week.

The Tesla rep offered only his apologies.  I would now be spending at least a few hundred on Ubers for the week.

While any delay would be a little disappointing I am quite frustrated at how Tesla handled this.  If I was notified last week it would not have been and issue.  But to be called at 6:30 pm when I have delivery scheduled for 11 the next day... That is ridiculous.

He said he had a long list of calls to make so I expect that some of you will be getting a call as well.  I would be interested to hear if anyone else got a delay.

Should I request some sort of reparation from Tesla when I go Saturday?  What do all of you think would be a fair request?

TeslaMotors,frustrating,ht5ocl,Issues after mobile service installed loaner wheel,"Less than 500 miles and I got a flat. Bad one, tire needs replaced. None in stock, so mobile service put on a loaner wheel for the time being, and put mine in the trunk.

As soon as I set off, things acted funny. No regenerative braking. Traction control keeps flashing yellow at me. No autopilot/cruise. But the most troublesome is a clicking/rattling coming from near my feet. It sounds like the computer trying to fire the brakes. I tried calling back the mobile service tech, but he just kept saying that if there's no vibration, I'm safe, and that he put the right size wheel on. Wouldn't seem to listen and actually address my issue.

Also the TPMS system hasn't picked up the sensor in the new wheel after about 20 minutes of driving home. Seems unusual, but not threatening.

Lastly, when I finally got home, I was unloading stuff and noticed the replaced wheel is quite noticably hotter. Just standing next to it feeling the heat radiate into my legs, it was far more than any other wheel. At this point, I finally notice that the tire size doesn't match the rest of my wheels. So the tech did not install a matching wheel size.

I've concluded that since the smaller loaner wheel rotates faster than the others at the same speed, it's causing havoc with the traction control, which is trying to apply brakes to that wheel to slow it down, hence the noise at my feet and the heat at the wheel.

I plan to call the service center and get something set up to fix this tomorrow. By the way, how do you actually speak to a human on their frustrating automatic menu? 

But in the meantime, can anyone else confirm my suspicions? Has anyone else experienced anything like this? And did anything likely lead to unnecessary damage?",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ht5ocl/issues_after_mobile_service_installed_loaner_wheel/,ltjpunk387,56568.0,-0.9534
TeslaMotors,frustrating,9gnqag,The 1st circle of delivery hell.,"Let me preface this by saying I'm very much a Tesla fanboy, and honestly most of my frustration stems from the fact that I'm so terribly excited to drive this car.   But so far, my delivery experience has been just horrible.

The issues started early in the process, once I submitted my order I waited for weeks (all the while watching other people with later confirmation dates receive their cars).  So, I finally called Tesla, and the sales rep I spoke with seemed confused by my account status, and felt that I should have heard from a DSA or ISA by then (I had heard from neither).

I expect that my call prompted some activity behind the scenes because I got a call from my DSA a few hours later.  The call went well and he said that I should have the car ""by next weekend"".   Well ""next weekend"" came and went without a word from either the DSA or anyone else at Tesla.

On the following Thursday I noticed that my account showed a delivery date.  I was excited and added the date to my calendar, before realizing that the date was set at midnight on Friday night.  Concerned about this I called the store listed for the delivery and spoke with a sales rep there.  That rep informed me that they had never seen a midnight delivery date before, and that I should have an official date already.  They told me they would contact my DSA and have him get back in touch with me (he never did).

Saturday's midnight delivery time comes and goes without a sign, call or smoke signal.  And since it was the weekend my DSA was unavailable, so I called the shop again to see if they had any further information.   They didn't though again they seemed confused by the status of my order.  And again they said they would have the DSA reach out to me (he never did).

That brings me to today, so far today I've attempted to call my DSA a number of times always going to voicemail.  So at this point I called the main Tesla line to again try and figure out what is going on with my car.  The sales rep I spoke to was informed the following by the DSA via their internal chat:

1. Home deliveries do not have a set date or time, and that I can expect the car to show up randomly in the next \~14 days.
2. Full payment is required before they even schedule the delivery - meaning you cannot pay with a cashiers check at the time of delivery.

So, I have to pay for the car sight unseen and with a completely unknown delivery time... that's not really cool.

&#x200B;

TL:DR

Tesla has managed to create the worst shopping experience I've ever endured.   I look forward to having the car, but the buying experience is so bad that I couldn't recommend buying one to someone else.  At least not until they work out their logistics.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,95dy34,My first day with my Model 3 (some unique observations and ideas),"I took delivery yesterday of my Model 3 - RWD, Midnight Silver Metallic, 18"" aeros, EAP.

I wanted to recap my experience thus far and share some observations with the community.  In the days leading up to delivery, I was craving this sort of information so hopefully others find this helpful as well.  Hopefully some of this is unique and new!

ORDER and DELIVERY

* I ordered 7/23 and took delivery exactly 2 weeks later on 8/6 (much faster than expected)
* Delivery was rescheduled 3 times and the car was moved from one location (Decatur/Atlanta) to a new service/delivery center (Alpharetta/Roswell) that just opened closer to my house, seemingly as a surprise to even the delivery staff I spoke with
* While the delays were frustrating, every Tesla employee I worked with through the process was apologetic and empathetic.  If you're frustrated with them, I suggest taking into consideration that their volume has gone up 3x in the past month and they are struggling to keep pace.  Be patient and the WILL make it right.
* Delivery process itself took \~20 minutes
   * Signed 4 pieces of paper, all pre-printed and identical to my MVPA
   * Visually inspected the car, found a few spots where there was residue left.  Panel gaps were all fine, no real issues to speak to...just clear evidence the car was quickly unwrapped and prepped.  They took it back after I signed everything and buffed a few spots and everything cleaned up just fine
   * Car was already updated to the latest firmware

DRIVING IMPRESSIONS

* When you pull out of the delivery center, just drive!!!  Don't fiddle too long with settings or options, just drive the car!  Mirrors, seats, climate being an obvious exception--safety first!
* This car is so much fun to drive--endless smiles every time you put your foot down or throw it into a corner.  Even my wife was grinning ear to ear when she floored it and she's not at all a car person.  But to add some more description, it feels like the acceleration of heading into the drop on a roller coaster that rides on those super smooth rubber wheels (some of you will know what I'm talking about).  That smooth, consistent pull that you just sort of ramp into and then stays with you for a few seconds.  The acceleration is instant and doesn't fade until you let off.
* Regeneration takes some getting used to, but I'm going to give it a try vs. going with the lesser setting.  When you do let off, the pull is strong but after an hour or so you'll learn to feather the acceleration and not let off like you would in an ICE car.  I've owned both a Ford Focus Electric and a Ford Fusion Energi and it's much more noticeable than either car, but I actually think that's a benefit as it enables very near ""one pedal driving"" and obviously provides better efficiency.
* Handling is VERY GOOD in my opinion.  It's much better than a 3-series BMW I used to own.  Car stays flat, goes where you point it, and overall inspires a lot of driving confidence and control.
* Suspension is a tad stiff in my opinion, but isn't thrashy.  I'm still running 45-46psi cold (which is what it was at delivery) and I think i'll drop it to 42-43 as Elon suggested in a tweet a while ago.  After some spirited driving, the psi climbs to \~50psi and it's a bit too firm for my preference.
* TACC was available after \~30 miles, Autopilot a few miles later.  Used it on my commute this morning and it worked perfectly.  I'm positive in a few weeks I'll question why I waited so long to buy it.

INTERIOR

* The inside of the car smells like donuts.  Seriously, after sitting for a while when the AC turns on and you get in the car, it's a sweet smell.  No idea if that's common, but it beats the cat piss smell some people have reported and is really pleasant.  My nearly 3 year old son loves it and asked this morning if we were going to ride in the donut car.
* 
* The screen was familiar and 2nd nature after an hour with the car.  Everything is very well laid out, intuitive, and highly functional.  I've read and can confirm, it's the same as going from an older phone to touch screen phone...there's a learning curve but very quickly you see buttons and old ways of doing it as inferior and outdated.
* Seats are VERY good.  I wish their were perforated and/or cooled, but otherwise they're very adjustable and super comfortable.
* Glass roof is a non-issue for heat/sunlight.  It was 99 degrees on the car temp yesterday, full sun, driving for a while and it was never uncomfortable.  Wife commented she was looking for a shade at one point but she didn't have sunglasses.
* Mirrors seem too small at first, but once adjusted, they're angled in such a way that you can really see what matters while minimizing their size/presence in and on the vehicle.  Very clever design in my opinion.
* Navigation is excellent.  Most automakers try to be too cute with this, presumably to overcoming hardware limitations.  I love that there's just a qwerty keyboard and there's no nonsense about disabling while in motion.
* Sound system is very good, not great.  I personally found setting immersive sound to high, bass and mid to +3.0 and mid to treble at +2.5, along with fade slightly forward of center to do well with the music I listen to (alternative rock, classic rock, some top 40)

ACCESSORIES/MODIFICATIONS

* I removed the aero covers and put on the new caps/lug covers from Tesla's kit immediately when I got the car home.  Looks so much better in my opinion.
* I also installed the Kenriko matte black center console wrap.  It took about 40 minutes and I just took my time.  Very happy with the results, although I'm a bit concerned the material may scratch too easily.  We'll see how it holds up over time.  I'd recommend giving this a shot yourself vs. paying a shop to do it...easy enough if you're careful and patient working with the material.
* I ordered Aero Costmetics Wash and Wax All--will give that a shot today and see if I like the results.  It seemed well reviewed and a good option for keeping the car clean
* Am scheduled to get XPEL ultimate wrapped on the whole front, doors, rear quarters, and trunk lip in a few weeks
* Am also going to order rim guards from Evannex--am nervous with the wheels as there is a pronounced lip that extends beyond the tires.  I know I'll be pissed if I scratch one and even though I've never really had an issue with this in the past, it's cheap insurance in my opinion.

IDEAS/SUGGESTIONS

* There should be an option within profiles to switch acceleration to ""chill"" when using TACC and autopilot.  I've read some people set up a HIGHWAY profile to do this and switch it on/off, but that's annoying and it would help ""smooth"" the acceleration when using the those features.
* Walk-away lock honk should be disabled at homelink locations.  I don't want the car to honk in my garage.  There's probably a lot of other improvements around homelink and auto-locking in general as many have suggested.
* The trunk springs are very stiff--I've seen someone selling replacement springs to make it easier to close.
* Frunk is also kind of a pain to close, but just have to be careful.

All in all, I couldn't be happier with the car thus far.  It lives up to all of the hype and then some.  It's so obvious that this is the future, yet I see other new cars and features and no one else is even close.  Other car manufacturer's are trying to teach an old dog new tricks instead of recognizing that they need a whole different animal to compete with this car.  The next few years are going to be a lot of fun--both driving this car and watching what Tesla does.  I'm a conservative investor, and against my better judgment I'm seriously considering throwing a few $$$ into Tesla purely for fun and speculation.  I read the post from another user about the case for being long on Tesla and it makes so much sense.  They're disrupting an industry that hasn't being disrupted in decades, with a product that people are lining up to buy, and they're soon to be profitable doing it.  Does indeed sound a lot like Apple and even as others eventually catch up with their hardware, Tesla has a serious head start in so many ways.

I hope all of you buy this car and love it as much as I do!

TeslaMotors,frustrating,bnrmxq,My uneventful and painless Service Center experience,"TLDR: a very wordy account of a broken windshield that was fixed with no frustration - other than the fact it happened in the first place.  As an added bonus I was loaned a Model S and converted my father-in-law to Tesla and EVs.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

My round trip commute is 100 miles on rural Southeastern, USA roads where logging trucks are a common sight.  One unfortunate morning one of them kicked up some sort of debris that hit my Model 3 windshield when I was going ~70 mph and left a crack in the lower right hand corner.  Far from ideal, but I‚Äôd be naive to expect this would never happen on the roads I drive.

I finish work that day and come back out to my car, unplug (thanks for the free charging at work, employer!), and hop in.  The crack has slowly started to spread, and now it‚Äôs to the point where a windshield repair is out of the question and it will need to be replaced.

Well this sucks.

I call Safelite - no windshields in stock - but they give me a quote and say they can have it in two weeks, but I would still have to go to the Service Center to have the front cameras recalibrated.  No sense in making two different trips, so I call my most convenient Tesla Service Center.  They quoted me a price only 100 more than Safelite (1000 vs 900), didn‚Äôt have the part, but would order it if I wanted to proceed.  They didn‚Äôt have a timeline for delivery of the new glass.

That was Friday.  On Monday, I got a call that it had arrived and I could proceed to schedule an appointment.  Thursday (3 days later) worked for both parties.

On Weds night I headed to my in-laws since I live three hours away and they‚Äôre only 20 minutes from the center.  The next morning, I check in, am handed the fob to a Model S 90D, and my father-in-law and I proceed to enjoy the Model S for the day (its more his style than the 3 - now he wants one).

I get a text a few hours later, pick up the car and drove off.  

End of story.

Extra thoughts:
- Charlotte, NC Service Center
- some will say $1000 is too expensive for a windshield replacement.  My BMW driving friends say this is an expected price for that service when you have a luxury vehicle.
- some will say 3 hours is too far to travel for service.  While I agree, it was an inconvenience I fully expected when I purchased it last year.  Not going to complain about something I knew would happen beforehand.
- some will say the camera calibration is an overly complicated need for something as simple as a windshield replacement.  Again, my BMW driving friends confirmed they‚Äôve had to do something similar for one of their cars (a newer M3 IIRC)

TeslaMotors,frustrating,be7juw,CCS or CHAdeMO for Model 3?,"Ok guys and gals. What do we need to do to show a need/demand for some sort of CCS or CHAdeMO adapter in the US for the Model 3? I feel like i don't see this issue addressed often if at all, and I can't think of the last time anyone at Tesla has even mentioned it. Hell, I'd pay just to have the european charge port installed on my car as it does both CCS and Tesla charging. I know it isn't a big deal for most people, and it usually isn't for me either. But I have a lengthy trip coming up for Easter to the rural MidWest. In a packed day, I don't have time to stop at a NEMA plug (which is considerably out of the way). The local WalMart where I'm going has several EV charging stations. They have both CCS and CHAdeMO, so it is pretty frustrating when I have to keep explaining to friends and family why I can't use them without actually having an answer. I can't be the only one that wants this. I feel like the people with the most influence on twitter that could maybe get Elon/Tesla's attention don't suffer from this problem because they live in CA for the most part. Is there anyone here within the Sub that we could ask to raise this question to Elon or Tesla? Thoughts?

TeslaMotors,frustrating,dl4i9w,Tesla sent my local bodyshop the wrong parts 4 times,"Hey, I‚Äôve had my model 3 for under 3 months and it‚Äôs spent the last month at a bodyshop waiting for a set of bolts from Tesla. They‚Äôve sent the shop the wrong bolts FOUR (4) times, and week after week I get a call from the shop telling me ‚Äúsorry can‚Äôt get your car back to you this week because we got the wrong bolts again‚Äù. Today I got forwarded an email detailing a software issue that‚Äôs preventing the proper order to be sent. 

This is incredibly frustrating that Tesla is unable to have a human physically put the right bolts in a box and ship them. I understand that bug fixes have to be prioritized and fixed and that takes time, but fixing this software bug shouldn‚Äôt prevent the physical transport of the right parts at all.  Are there others there also stuck in this limbo of indefinitely waiting for parts? I just want my car back.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,b8yv2n,"PSA: If Autopilot crosses lane markings after activation, your car may need service","I took my Model S for service a few weeks ago. They did a routine wheel alignment, and they also replaced the steering column due to some unrelated noise issues. When I got my car back, I noticed that enabling AP would throw the car into the adjacent lane.

I took the car back in. They redid the wheel alignment. No improvement.

I brought the car back a second time. The service manage straight up told me he ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt believe me‚Äù about this being an issue. I took him for an uneventful test drive. He told me it‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for AP to be biased towards a side of the road. I argued that it wasn‚Äôt like that for my first 40k miles of ownership, and that what I experienced wasn‚Äôt safe. They decided to replace the AP camera (what?!). Of course, no fix.

Two more service appointments later, and a second test drive with a really cool technician, and I was able to demonstrate the issue. The technician took ownership of the issue.

Eventually, they found out that the steering column was reinstalled incorrectly, and some part was misaligned. The wheels and steering wheel were aligned properly, but the AP sensors didn‚Äôt know the steering angle correctly.

This was extremely frustrating to get resolved. Even on my second visit, I told them it *had* to be a steering issue; the car's instrument cluster clearly knew it was crossing the lane markings. Instead, they wasted time trying other things. Having been called a liar was also not pleasant (though they did apologize about it after).

If you run into a similar issue, please don‚Äôt give up, and make sure they eventually take care of it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/b8yv2n/psa_if_autopilot_crosses_lane_markings_after/,kodek64,21302.0,-0.291

TeslaMotors,complaint,6cygwy,My Model S 75D Review. My surprising findings and complaints after waiting 7 years to own one.,"Lots of folks seem to have been picking up 75s and 75Ds the last week or two. Must be from the pricing change that Tesla made about a month ago. Been seeing a lot of reviews from new 75D owners and wanted to share my specific surprising findings, and disappointments after a few hundred miles. I've been wanting a Tesla vehicle ever since I heard of the roadster (back in 2010 I think). Was waiting for a Model 3, but I just couldn't stand waiting any more and the base model change to a 75kWh pack, with included power lift gate enticed me. I found an inventory car with the somewhat rare color combo I liked and finally gave in.

It‚Äôs a silly human thing to do, putting any real thought into naming a car. It‚Äôs still a fun little thing to do so I named my car ‚ÄúThunder Road‚Äù, after the [spaceship](http://brandedinthe80s.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/explorers2.jpg) in the movie ‚Äú[Explorers](http://www.clearplay.com/MovieBattle/images/tt0089114-1.jpg)‚Äù. It‚Äôs from a Bruce Springsteen song. 


Here are the specs for ‚ÄúThunder Road‚Äù:

- Model S 75D with Deep Blue Metallic paint
- 19‚Äù Standard Slipstream wheels
- Glass roof
- Premium Package upgrade (premium next-gen seats)
- White interior with Dark Ash wood decor
- Center console
- Black alcantara headliner
- Enhanced Autopilot




For reference, here are the cars I‚Äôve had or driven recently that I‚Äôm comparing my new Model S to:

Rented:

- Tesla Model S P85D with AP1 (rented twice on Turo)
- Tesla Model S 60 with AP1 (rented once on Turo)

Owned:

- 2010 Ford Mustang V6 Convertible (auto, most recent)
- 2014 BMW i3 
- 2013 BMW 335i (auto)
- 2010 Mazdaspeed 3 (manual)
- 2007 Mazda RX8 (manual)



**COMPLAINTS:**

**No speed-sensitive volume adjustment.**

Most annoying part of the car. Every car that I‚Äôve had the last decade has had this feature. It‚Äôs a *software feature* and it astonishes me that something so simple, yet so annoying to be without, is missing from an otherwise perfectly relaxing driving experience. The radio volume should automatically adjust to your speed, getting louder as you get faster and quieter as you come to a stop. It‚Äôs very annoying adjusting the volume *every time* I slow down or come to a stoplight, and start going again. This should be a simple software update. Hell, I could gather the volume change data and provide the ground work for the algorithm myself. I just might do that, to grab Elon‚Äôs attention.

**Volume of navigation instructions are inaudible over music.**

This is something I noticed the few times I rented Teslas on Turo and I always assumed it was some setting somewhere I wasn‚Äôt seeing. Now that I have my own Model S, I‚Äôve turned the navigation instruction volume all the way to 11 and I still can‚Äôt hear it over the music while I‚Äôm driving. It dips the volume of the music, but not enough. I end up missing the instruction. I wish they could also set it to pause the playback each time there‚Äôs an instruction, like Apple Maps does when using an iPhone. 

EDIT: 
I'm starting to think that I just listen to music and podcasts louder than most people. Though the way music and podcasts are mastered makes this completely subjective, I usually am rocking out with the volume up around 9 or 10 with music. My beef with the way the stereo's mixing system is that when I'm playing music loudly, it should know to lower the media playback volume more than normal to compensate. I almost never have music down to a 3 or 4 unless I'm at a stoplight AND I'm not ""rocking out"". I agree, when I'm listening to music or podcasts at a lower level, then the volume of the navigation instructions are fine. When I'm on the freeway going 80mph listening to a podcast at about a 7 or an 8, even with the Nav volume set to 11, I'm often fighting to hear the nav instructions over the podcast dialogue.

**Turning Radius**

Man I really didn‚Äôt realize how bad the turning radius is. I find myself having to do 3-point turns in parking lots all the time now. Maybe I‚Äôm just not used to it yet having come from the SUPER nimble BMW i3. Would a 4-wheel steering upgrade on future Model Ss help in this regard? 

**Ambient lights too bright.**

The ‚Äúsoft LED ambient interior lights‚Äù are not really so soft. If find them to be too bright at night and I wish there was a way to dim the ambient lighting separately from dimming the touchscreen and binnacle. It looks really cool, it‚Äôs just too bright.

**The blind spots are a bit tricky.**

The rearview mirror is rather useless at seeing out the back, as many have said before. I agree with them. I haven‚Äôt quite been able to tune my side mirrors correctly yet to peer into my blind spots AND provide a view of the approaching cars in the lanes on either side of me. I‚Äôve resorted to sticking those big bubble mirrors onto the tips of my side mirrors, so we‚Äôll see how that goes. The ‚Äúblindspot monitoring‚Äù is rather useless unfortunately. It‚Äôs not very immediate or reliable.

**The glass roof is actually too dark for my tastes.**

This is really just a preference for me, but I wish the tinting on the all-glass roof wasn‚Äôt so dark. You can barely even tell it‚Äôs see-through at all. Having come from enjoying a convertible, I LIKE being bathed in sunlight while I drive around. I don‚Äôt expect Tesla to do anything about this and I agree with their decision to make it dark, considering how many people worry about the glass roof being too hot in the sun. See below for my thoughts on that. 

**Volume of music comes back after starting car.**

Whatever volume the music was set to when I parked the car before I opened the door, will come roaring back when I put the car into ‚Äúgear‚Äù the next time I drive. Many cars I‚Äôve had reset the radio volume to the same low level every time I start the car.

**Bassy ride.**

There‚Äôs a surprising amount of low-frequency rumble heard as I drive this around. I‚Äôm imagining the large, flat sections of the battery pack in the floor resonating, creating low-frequency pressure waves. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a cause some engineer could explain. After having the car for a few weeks, I‚Äôm already accustomed to it and don‚Äôt notice it as much, but still wish it wasn't there.

**The frunk is really nice to have, but it‚Äôs surely not something I‚Äôd want to access very often.**  

I‚Äôm just not a fan of pressing on the hood at all, even though it‚Äôs the Tesla recommended method. The frunk IS perfect for my emergency road supplies, and my aftermarket subwoofer amplifier. Stuff I like to carry around and I don‚Äôt use that often, if ever. I‚Äôve stuck all that in the frunk, out of the way, leaving the trunk wide open (for things like a subwoofer). One last consideration for those thinking of mounting an amplifier in there, is that it‚Äôs not air conditioned. If you were to instead mount your amps in the trunk, your amps would be cooled in the interior, like you‚Äôd be.

**The Traffic Aware Cruise Control, currently (17.17.17) is not very smooth.**

Elon himself has already described the current version of the Autopilot driving experience as ‚Äúunpleasant‚Äù and I think he‚Äôs right. More specifically, when it comes to the TACC for me, there‚Äôs so many times when I‚Äôm cruising on the freeway with nobody immediately in front of me and I can feel the car slightly lifting off and back on the throttle. It seems like the radar is picking up little bits of cars or objects far off in adjacent lanes and constantly momentarily reacting to them and starting to slow down, only to realize they‚Äôre false positives and continue back at the set cruise speed. The acceleration and ‚Äúbraking‚Äù is also a bit jerky, as others have noted. 

 I‚Äôm comparing all of this to how well my BMW i3‚Äôs TACC worked, which was better in some circumstances. One of them was during interchange ramps. The i3 would handle TACC really well on sharp freeway interchanges, while the Model S lost track of the car in front of me since it was so far around the curve that it tried to launch me forward into the wall. It seemed like the i3 had it‚Äôs TACC algorithm programmed so that the more the steering wheel is turned in a curve, the car would proportionately slow down. However, feelings about this and auto-steer are greatly affected by the knowledge and confidence that a software update could fix these issues at any time. It doesn‚Äôt worry me 
because I know that it‚Äôs only a matter of time until the autopilot team really nails the software perfectly. I‚Äôm patiently waiting for the autopilot update in June/July that‚Äôs considered ‚Äúsmooth as silk‚Äù.  








**SURPRISING FINDINGS:**


**The mystique of ‚ÄúTesla‚Äù has faded for me within a week of ownership.**

I‚Äôm quite surprised by this. The excitement of finally having a Tesla vehicle after wanting one for over 7 years is already gone, and is instead replaced by the simple enjoyment of the best car I‚Äôve ever driven. The hype and aura has gotten out of the way and the experience is just purely the enjoyment of a great vehicle. 

**Build quality and material quality have definitely improved.**

As people have said, the build quality and materials quality has always been an issue with Tesla. I‚Äôve driven an early P85D and a 60 from the same year and I‚Äôve noticed the overall quality has improved since then. Here are some ways: 

- During my delivery inspection checklist, I walked around and inspected every inch of the car outside and in. Everything appears much better put together. Panel gaps are smaller and more even. While installing my dash cams, I can feel how tightly the interior pieces are fit together. Everything looks clean and well made. While I‚Äôm not comparing this to other high end automakers, I‚Äôm personally plenty satisfied after having driven the older Model Ss.
- The interior is quieter. One of the first things I noticed when I rented the P85D for the first time was the road noise, the brake noise, and the motor noise. Especially having come from my BMW i3. The new car is vastly better for all those noises. The motor whine is still heard during heavy acceleration, but it does not bother me. The road noise is much improved and I can‚Äôt really hear the brakes like I did in that P85D.
- The seats are better. Probably when they switched over to the next gen seats. More squishy soft and better bolstering. The white seats are much softer and more leather-like than I was expecting. I was expecting them to have a plastic-y feeling (since they‚Äôre polyurethane).
-  The backup camera has improved. In the previous cars, I thought the quality of the backup camera was just okay. My salesman said they upgraded to a 1080p backup camera at some point and its definitely noticed. Quite noticeable since its blown up and displayed on that giant touchscreen.
- The new center console is better. The P85D I rented a few times had an older center console added to it and the  doors and hinges in the new one just feel like they work better. 
- I‚Äôve only a few hundred miles on my car at this point, but so far no creaks or rattles. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some coming though. EDIT ON 2017/09/01: Car developed a rattle in the B pillars, mostly on the drivers side. I fixed the passenger side myself with double-sided tape. The driver side rattle was fixed after two service center visits, which were both excellent experiences and I had a loaner each time.

**The HVAC system is the best I‚Äôve ever had.**

This is the first HVAC system in a car that I‚Äôve ever had where you really just set your temperature and forget about it. Set it to 72¬∫, it warms the car on a 65¬∫ day and cools the car with AC on an 85¬∫ day. I have yet to need to fiddle with the settings for fan speed, temp, or circulation. The ‚Äúauto‚Äù setting just works, works quickly, and works nearly silently. Also, I think the HEPA filtration system is really making for a delightful breathing experience on the freeways stuck in traffic around stinky diesels. 

**The coil spring suspension is actually really great.**

I‚Äôve only ever driven Teslas with the air suspension, and I was expecting the coil springs to be kind of shitty in comparison. So far this has been one of the smoothest riding cars I‚Äôve ever had. It just eats up bumps so much better than all of the other cars I‚Äôve had. There‚Äôs a few specific bumps I drive over every day and normally I have to be gentle when going over them, especially with some of the sportier cars I‚Äôve had. The S just encourages me to plow over them without even slowing down. It‚Äôs fantastic.

**I love the D.**

I really wanted the D, as this would be my first all-wheel drive car, and I‚Äôm glad I got it. There‚Äôs specific street surfaces around town where past cars would struggle for traction when going over, around, or accelerating out of them. They‚Äôd cut power to the wheels and I‚Äôd be sad. Between the the dual motor setup, the great suspension, and the 19‚Äù wheels, this car just grips and rolls right over that shit no problem. Gives supreme confidence in evasive maneuvers, and sudden traffic-entering situations.

**Acceleration.**

The sweet spot for acceleration in the 75D is between 15mph and 60mph. It doesn‚Äôt have that ‚Äúsnap‚Äù off the line like you get in the Insane and Ludicrous cars, but once you get rolling for a second, the 75D really pushes you back into the seat. I‚Äôve always said, I like driving ‚Äúspiritedly‚Äù from stoplights and around corners, and electric vehicles allow me to do that without feeling like such a duchebag, making all sorts of roaring engine noises and tire chirping. I can get the g-force feelings I like without looking like such a tool (or so I think!).

**Headlights are great.**

Despite the Model S not getting top marks for the headlights when having it‚Äôs crash safety rated, I find the LED headlights to be great. Nice and crisp and bright, with a wide spread of light. Very easy to see my surroundings. I haven‚Äôt used the auto high-beams yet.

**The glass roof is not hot.**

It needs to be said again. The glass roof is FINE in the sunlight. The tinting and IR/UV ray blocking works fantastically and the air conditioning system does really well at keeping the interior cool. The difference can easily be felt by sitting inside one and moving your hand in and out of the sunlight, in and out from underneath the glass roof.

**Summon is pretty good.**

I was pleasantly surprised how well summon works. Using the key fob and disabling the ‚Äúhold button down during summon‚Äù, it‚Äôs fairly fast and easy to initiate summon and it works fairly well when moving over slight bumps in the ground. It gets a little more shy when I try to initiate summon with the Remote S app, however.

**Traffic on the map.**

Previously when I‚Äôd get into my car, one of the first things I‚Äôd do is pull out my phone and open Google maps to check the traffic along the route I‚Äôd planned on taking. Now I get in the Model S and take a peek at the touchscreen. It‚Äôs all there for me without having to do anything!

**The stock stereo is acceptable.**

I‚Äôm an audiophile, and I wasn‚Äôt expecting good things from the standard stock stereo, but I found it neither good nor bad. The only thing it really *needed* for me was a real subwoofer. The stereo was missing the ‚Äúpresence‚Äù that a little bit of 20hz-100hz would bring. Once I added an aftermarket sub to the system it sounds a lot more full and punchy without it needing to even be ‚Äúloud‚Äù bass.

TeslaMotors,complaint,c9fpgv,How the Tesla Model 3 has Ruined Me,"&#x200B;

[Supercharging on the Way Home](https://preview.redd.it/uy11zpftgh831.jpg?width=4160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3947e75dfd6c0767121845235a5973ed8e72ea2e)

In November last year I took delivery of my black, rear wheel drive, long range Tesla Model 3. I‚Äôd never driven in a Tesla before, much less driven one myself. Still, the lure of a 300+ mile range fully electric vehicle and the soon to be cut in half Federal tax credit swayed me and my wife to take the plunge. Six or so months and 11,000 miles later, the car has more or less ruined me on driving any other vehicle. The Model 3 does things that feel groundbreaking and paradigm shifting, and, even more amazingly, in a, ‚ÄúWhy hasn‚Äôt it always been this way,‚Äù sort of way.

1. Entry, exit, and control of the vehicle through the app is pretty much flawless (note: with a modern phone) and doesn't require a dedicated device. Walking up to the car with your enabled smartphone means getting in is as simple as pulling on the handle. Other cars have similar behaviors with key fobs, but who wants to carry anything else around when I already have a computer with all sorts of connectivity options sitting in my pocket? This is what Tesla has done; eliminated something I used to have to carry around. The funny thing is I never really thought much about carrying keys around until I didn‚Äôt have to do so anymore. Now that I don‚Äôt have to carry keys, when I drive my wife‚Äôs car I‚Äôm very aware that I have this other device in my pocket.
2. The acceleration is effortless, silent, and addicting. Seriously addicting. I came to the Tesla from an economy sedan, so the difference for me is greater than someone who may have had another performance luxury vehicle, but oh my God is the acceleration just lovely. Even better, it‚Äôs all so effortless. When I get in another vehicle now and put the pedal down it feels like everything is just working so hard to achieve what the Tesla does instantaneously and with almost no noise (just an appealing motor whine that reminds me of the Tumbler in stealth mode in the Nolan lead Batman series). When someone in a traditionally powered vehicle drives past with their engine roaring, it feels like such an anachronism now.
3. The entire braking system does things the right way. The magnetic braking means I typically only have to use my physical brakes at somewhere between 4 and 6 MPH to come to a complete stop, instead of braking the vehicle all the way down from 60 or 65 MPH, which will clearly create far more wear on the braking system. The magnetic braking was the thing I was most nervous about initially, having read stories of people coming to jerky stops when getting used to it. Those fears were entirely unfounded. Except for my first toll booth stop (which was hilariously about 15 feet too soon), I‚Äôve found it entirely intuitive and easy to get used to. Now, when I drive a different car and take my foot off the accelerator I‚Äôm cranky about the fact that I have to push the stupid brake pedal down (what is this, the 50s?) to really slow the car, instead of the car just doing it automatically.
4. Speaking of annoying things you just do in your car without thinking about it, how about turning the car on and off? The Tesla system to turn the car on (you really don't, but you get it ready to go by pushing the brake pedal with your phone in your pocket) and turn it off (you really don‚Äôt, just open the door) doesn‚Äôt need to be a Tesla only thing. Any car with a key fob could do both of these things, really. Why do they require me to push a different button? Speaking of that, the fact that the Tesla automatically locks the doors when you get out of range takes a little getting used to (there‚Äôs initially a fear it won‚Äôt work) but once you do it‚Äôs another one of those little things that all cars should just do, but for some reason don‚Äôt. Note, however, that getting used to this stuff means you‚Äôll probably leave your other cars running accidentally. My wife has caught me just hopping out of our other car a few times without shutting it off. Sorry, I thought this was 2019.
5. The minimal gauges was something I loved from the moment I sat in the car for the first time. It took about 10 minutes to get used to looking slightly right instead of slightly down for my speed, and (admittedly) about a week to get used to the lane obstacle detection in the same location, but it‚Äôs all so clean and tidy. The internal navigation is fantastic (and the 3D perspective it gives is a nice touch), and the infotainment system works well (generally). I was initially worried I‚Äôd hate not having SiriusXM (and honestly, I still think for this level of car it should be an option), but I ended up cancelling my app-based Sirius subscription about 2 months after getting the car because there are a ton of options built in for free. Getting into a more typical car now feels like information overload, with dozens of dials, gauges, and buttons competing for my attention, and LED light coming from every direction. Driving the Model 3, in particular at night, feels far more connected with the outside world because of the minimal distractions within the cabin.
6. What does gas cost right now? I honestly don‚Äôt know, but up until November I‚Äôd always had a sense of what it cost per gallon, because I was filling up every 6 days. Even better, my wife barely has to fill up more than once a month because on the weekends we pile all five of us into my car for basically every drive (us plus our three daughters). Our other vehicle (a Pacifica) is relegated to times where we both need to go somewhere or we‚Äôre driving a long enough distance that having three kids in the back is going to lead to arguments. Otherwise, even though the kids clearly have significantly more space in the minivan, they always want to drive in the Tesla. This gets me to another reason this car has ruined me on other cars. Sure, I need to charge, but I just plug in when I get home, and I head in to the house. No more freezing while pumping gas in the middle of February. Sure, I lost approximately 25% range in the Winter months due to the cold, but that‚Äôs not much of a problem when you can ‚Äúfill up‚Äù every night (scheduled to use off-peak electric prices) if you‚Äôre worried about your range, and the car is filling up while I‚Äôm reading, hanging out with the wife and kids, or sleeping.
7. How about service? I had a minor squeaking coming from the back wheels when reversing (common problem) and my horn would only sound when I pushed the right hand side (again, common). I scheduled service within the app for the nearest location, and then Tesla sent a message a few days later saying that these issues could be addressed by their mobile service system, so they drove to my house and did everything in my driveway. I didn‚Äôt need to go to some shop, sit in their waiting room for who knows how long, try to work using their wifi, etc. I just hung out at my house, doing what I usually would, and they fixed the two issues. Awesome.
8. Software updates are flawless and fast. You get notified on your phone that an update is available, click to start the update process, and then a little later get notified that the update is complete. By comparison, software updates in our Pacifica created a situation where climate control was broken for a month while they figured out what went wrong, and updating my old car required me to download images to a flash drive and sit with the car running for an hour while the update was applied. Updates are also super frequent and not insignificant in what they‚Äôre doing, including things like adding 5% more range to the car and better power (as if that was really necessary).

To be objective, however, there are some annoyances:

1. Voice control is still pretty limited. My 2012 Ford had better voice control options (voice and phrase detection was far worse in that car, which is pretty much flawless in the Tesla, but there were more phrases it would recognize), including some that I think are absolutely necessary, like, ‚ÄúCall Sarah on mobile.‚Äù Right now in the Tesla I can only say, ‚ÄúCall Sarah,‚Äù and it lists all the numbers I have for her in my contacts, which requires me to scroll to find the right one and tap on it on the display.
2. Speaking of phone control, the pick up / hang up options should be able to be ‚Äútapped‚Äù through the steering wheel buttons.
3. Cell connectivity sometimes just flakes out for the in-car infotainment. I park underground at work, so the car won‚Äôt have LTE coverage in the garage, but it also seems to just lose the ability to reconnect when I come back up above ground (probably weekly). A couple of times a month it seems to require a soft reboot to get it to reconnect to LTE.
4. The piano black plastic covers for the center console area are scratch and dust magnets. I tried to wrap them but messed it up the first time so I haven‚Äôt tried again. Still, for an expensive car I‚Äôd think they‚Äôd have a nicer setup in such a prominent area. It‚Äôs pretty clear this is a common complaint when center console wraps are such a common purchase for Model 3 owners.

Two other points worth mentioning quickly:

1. This car is more contagious than a yawn at the DMV. A friend and my parents both bought Model 3s after driving in mine basically once. It‚Äôs that nice. It‚Äôs that different.
2. I recently got back from a 3.5 hour drive in our other car (family vacation), and I immediately volunteered to go get groceries, just so I could drive the Tesla. Usually the last thing I‚Äôd want to do is drive more after a long drive. Instead, it just highlighted the advantages of the Tesla.

So, that‚Äôs it at a high level. The Model 3 has ruined me on other cars, and it has done so by concentrating on the everyday aspects of car driving. In the Kano model, it has basically added delighters and performance features that everyone else is just checking the box on. It takes a lot of things we just take for granted as ‚Äúthe way it‚Äôs done,‚Äù and reimagined them in a way that feels like it‚Äôs redefining what driving should be in the 21st century.

TeslaMotors,complaint,rpvjtr,V11 interface theory...it's for first-time Tesla owners more than anything.,"The v11 interface has plenty of stuff for long-time Tesla drivers like the blind spot camera and light show and so on, but it's the interface changes that are bothering us.

Perhaps the biggest complaint is that things that used to be right there on the bottom bar are now hidden in a menu (sometimes two layers deep).

After using it for a bit, I have a theory about why things are the way they are. With the ""apps"" being draggable, that sort of makes sense...they're preparing for a future where there are more apps. Perhaps an app store, or maybe just more apps and services. 

But with the controls, I think this release is acknowledging that the ""new Tesla owner"" experience can be a little confusing and the company clearly plans for there to be a LOT of new customers over the next year or two. They're at a 1M/yr run rate now and have two plants coming online in the next 3-4 months.

When someone buys their first Tesla, as I did a year ago, it's a little confusing how some things are on the bottom bar, some things are in the main car screen menu, and some things are in submenus. It's not clear which controls you can work from the steering wheel and which only work on the screen. 

This release, for all its faults, does two things well. One, it puts pretty much all the critical driving stuff on ONE screen. You tap the car icon, and all the things you need while driving are right there. There's more on that screen, it's a better use of space, it's clearer for first-time Tesla owners. Odds are if you want to know ""how do I [common car thing you do while driving]"" it's on that screen when you tap the car icon.

If you ever use the screen to do something you can do with the steering wheel, a little tutorial popup appears to tell you how you can use the knobs on the steering wheel (like if you skip forward on a music track or adjust the volume). I don't recall ever seeing that before.

I think they've got a little work to do, sure. Showing dual AC controls when the AC isn't split is more confusing than not and takes up valuable space. They could allow a few more icons on the toolbar, they don't need a ""recently used apps"" section, and if they let us drag most common controls down there instead of just apps it would solve nearly all problems.

But I think, from the 30,000-foot view, this update probably makes the ""first time Tesla"" experience a bit less confusing. And it seems to me, with the huge number of anticipated first-time Tesla owners over the coming year or two, that may have been a primary motive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/rpvjtr/v11_interface_theoryits_for_firsttime_tesla/,jasoncross00,73389.0,0.6708
TeslaMotors,complaint,y78460,Basic Autopilot problems getting worse and worse by the update. Stop-and-go traffic basically unusable.,"I‚Äôve had my ‚Äô22 M3 RWD coming up on a year. It of course was always fully Vision Only with no radar. Over the past year, I had to wait for updates to get up to similar specs as the radar enabled cars: following distance, finally 85MPH, etc. Overall in the beginning, I didn‚Äôt have too many complaints with Autopilot. I didn‚Äôt have the phantom braking that many did. The only complaint I had early on was Autopilot drove too aggressively in stop-and-go traffic. Mainly it would fully accelerate up if the car in front just barely moved. It was so embarrassing I would never use it with guests in the car. I was able to work around that for the most part by lowering autopilot speed and changing to chill mode in those moments. Not ideal but it somewhat worked. I would do every software update in hopes it would fix it, like a lot of do. Fast forward to today. I down right refuse to use Autopilot in traffic because of how dangerous it is. It drives like a teenager learning to drive. It still does that full acceleration thing but now it slams on the brakes as soon as a car in front stops in stop-and-go traffic. And when I say the car in front stops, I don‚Äôt mean they slammed on their brakes, they were driving like a normal good driver would. I‚Äôve had two different times where the brake check my cars does causes the person behind me to almost hit me. Needing to swerve off to the side. I‚Äôm too fearful to use it for the day when a driver behind me is just a tad distracted and bam, accident.  My old tricks of speed, following distance, chill mode, don‚Äôt seem to matter as much. 

Is anyone else dealing with this shit? I keep hearing they are gonna combine the FSD stack and life will be bliss but I‚Äôm not holding my breath. Stop-and-go traffic is the true time Autopilot should shine but I‚Äôd honestly say that I‚Äôve driven in shittier competitors cars and they do a smoother job of it. Tesla really needs to get their head out of their asses and address things like this. I‚Äôve owned TSLA for a long time and followed the M3 since release. I feel we are reaching a critical time for the company with all the competition. It depresses me to say that right now, I might recommend others to look at different manufacturers for a car. Tesla still is a very niche car for a specific personality until they can make it better for the masses.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/y78460/basic_autopilot_problems_getting_worse_and_worse/,HersheyStains,45580.0,-0.4822

I go to my state's BMV and am told the only way I can get a new temporary registration is to file a complaint against Tesla with the State Attorney General. So I did.

Tesla would not offer mobile service for this issue. Tesla also does not offer night or weekend appointments, nor valet service (like every other auto manufacturer I've dealt with does) so my only option was to use my own PERSONAL TIME from work to drive the vehicle an hour away to the nearest service center. I had to beg and plead for a loaner vehicle which was a pickup truck from Enterprise because the service center had no Tesla loaners to offer. Even at that, I was still pushed to accept Uber credits. In the middle of a pandemic. Uber credits, to ride with a stranger for 90+ miles back home, 70+ miles for my daily work commute, and 90+ more miles back to the service center.

TeslaMotors,complaint,9nw5u3,Model 3 Purchase Complaints,"Alright, so this is somewhat of a rant post, but I would really like to hear if I'm justified for feeling this way too.  

TLDR: Got a free upgrade from Tesla, had to revert the upgrade, have had 2 incorrect delivery dates on my account and 2 incorrect VIN numbers and misinformation through the whole thing.  My delivery specialist has no idea what she's doing.  Am I the asshole for being upset?

I purchased my Model 3, long range, rear wheel drive, black with aero rims in mid September, and since then Tesla has bounced me around every which way.  About a week after purchase, i received an email confirming my upgrade to sport rims, which I did not do or authorize, so I called Tesla and they told me that it was a free gift.  I'm thinking to myself that this is pretty cool, but the invoice doesn't reflect the credit, the price of my car had gone up $1500.  I end up receiving an email from my delivery specialist for something unrelated and I ask about this.  She says that she's never heard of that and that I must have made the change to my order (which I certainly did not do.)  We reverted the change, but by the time that she reverted it, I already had a VIN number for my car.  Two days later (on a Sunday), I get an email confirming my delivery for THE FOLLOWING DAY, at the WRONG ADDRESS.  I email my delivery specialist, but she doesn't respond until Tuesday and she says that was a mistake and it was a 'fake' delivery appointment that should have just been behind the scenes.  Later that week, my order change processes back to the aero wheels and I get a new VIN number, followed by a new delivery appointment a few days later, still to the wrong address.  I email my delivery specialist again and she doesn't respond until after the specified delivery day, once again telling me that it was a 'fake' appointment and I shouldn't have seen it.  Two days later my account is updated again and I no longer have a VIN number or a delivery appointment, but the original credit for $1500, for the rims that I no longer have, hits my account.

I am so frustrated by this whole process.  For a $50,000 car, Tesla should have top notch custom service.  This whole run-around of fake delivery dates, not responding to emails, and the original change to my order are ridiculous.  If they are going to give me a free upgrade, they should mark that in the account, or in the email confirming the change, and their delivery specialists should CERTAINLY be able to know what's going on.  All I know now is that if they remove the $1500 credit because I had to revert the rims, I will be extremely angry.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9nw5u3/model_3_purchase_complaints/,kevin63857,2523.0,-0.3057
TeslaMotors,complaint,jumtay,Submit your infotainment complaints to NHTSA,"Hello everyone. I wanted to bring up something that I think tesla is being sneaky about.

About a week ago we all got emails regarding a potential infotainment screen replacement regarding the memory card. For the past year I've been suffering for non-booting, freezing, scrambled screen, etc... So I figured I'd be a perfect candidate for the replacement.

I scheduled a service call for the issue and tesla said they ran diagnostics on my car and it is determined that my infotainment screen is not affected or has any problems. I've sent them multiple videos and photos showing them a variety of issues and they won't replace it.

I believe that they are trying to avoid a mandatory recall by saying that they will replace problematic screens but are dodging the actual replacement once they say they run diagnostics. Since we are not privy to the diagnostics or the reports, we don't know if it's actually correct or a lie.

If any of you are having infotainment issues, please go to the NHTSA website and let's have tesla be held accountable for their actions. This kind of behavior shouldn't be tolerated from the most valuable car company in the world. **Keep in mind, only 11 complaints have been submitted and Tesla has already started adjusting and sent out that email. Imagine the impact we could make if we all submitted our complaints. I took me under 5 minutes to submit my complaint. Your complaint can go a long way and potentially help thousands of people avoid having to pay for a replacement infotainment screen in the next few years.**

Big fan of what Tesla are doing but whenever I speak about them with some of my friends, I often run into the same arguement against electric which I don't have a great response for. The arguement being that the batteries are not very ecofriendly to produce or dispose of. That the mining process for lithium is highly destructive. 

Can anyone lay out the reality of these claims for me so I can have more informed discussions on this?

TeslaMotors,complaint,nkf409,My experience with Tesla Solar Roof installation.,"Bear in mind: I drive a Model 3. I own substantial TSLA stock, I have a CT and a Starlink dish on order. I'm a fan. 

But unless Tesla gets feedback, they won't get better.

Here's my Tesla Solar Roof experience so far.

TLDNR: It sucked. They need to step up their game. A LOT.

I have an 177 year old house in north central Massachusetts.
About 3000 square foot roof.

I first put down a deposit for a roof in late April
2020, over a year ago. Even with two powerwalls, the price, after
various rebates and incentives, seemed quite reasonable.

A Tesla engineer came and checked things out last summer, taking
measurements and photos, including in the attic under the roof.

I specifically called out the age of the roof, and that I was
concerned about weight limits. He said everything looked good,
except they'd need to put a new layer of sheathing on top of
the old boards. Added some cost, but I was not surprised. 

All the permitting got done by October, and I was told that I
could expect a delay until this spring.

Initially, tearoff was supposed to start Monday the 24th, today.
But the contractor called and postponed to Tuesday, tomorrow.
Thank God they did.

Last Friday a big truck pulled up with a load of Tesla materials,
the driver expecting to find a crew to unload a very heavy pallet,
presumably of solar tiles. We had no way to move  it, and after
a phone call to Tesla, he took it back. Thank God he did. 

Tomorrow morning, at 5 AM, a dumpster should arrive, followed by
the tear-off crew at 7 AM.

BUT: 8:05 PM, this evening, I get an email from Tesla saying
that the roof sagged too much (maybe 1.5 inches over its length, and I'd have to get that fixed,
and an engineer to sign off that it was now flat and strong enough,
before work could start This is a historic house, and that ain't
happening, quite aside from the substantial expense.

This DQ was received less than 11 hours before the (thankfully)
delayed tear off is due to start.

A frantic call to Tesla got an advisor after 15 minutes on hold,
and he agreed that it sucked. The only bright spot was that they
hadn't started work yet.

So, after over a year, I'm not getting a roof. I still have to
be up at 5AM to try to persuade a guy intent on leaving a dumpster
not to do so, and at 7AM to tell the contractor to go away.

TESLA: This type of experience does not make for a good reputation,
or customer-advocates.

--------------------
Follow up:

At 12:50 AM, Tesla sent a letter cancelling the project. Written in standard
lawyer approved English, admitting fault for nothing, taking responsibility
for nothing, apologizing for nothing. I did have to be up to turn away a 
huge dumpster at 5:40 AM, but the contractor seems to have ghosted me.

Notes:

The house is historic, some things happened here (not saying what as
not to dox myself - lets just say its in Wikipedia). However, its not registered
or in a historic district., and I'm free to modify it without any special approval.

However, it's beautiful, elegant, and I'd be a fool to ignore that. The Tesla 
roof tiles look a hell of a lot better than slapping panels on an existing roof.
I may go for a metal roof now.

The complaint from Tesla was over the bowing of the roof. They think its
10 cm over 6m. I think its quite a bit less - the photo they used was shot 
looking up the roof an angle, and subject to keystone distortion, making it
look worse than it is.

If I got it fixed, an engineer would have to sign off on it for both strength and
flatness. There wasn't a suggestion that it was actually weak, but that's the rules.
Tesla was mainly worried that the tiles would not be able to be weather proof
on a slightly curved surface.

My main beef over this is the timing - the whole fiasco took over a year, and
they had the photo they used to DQ the project since last summer, but didn't
contact me until literally hours
before work was due to start. Its only
good luck that tear off hadn't started before they noted the problem - the
contractor called and moved the date. Had it been Monday, as originally 
planned, I'd have a house with no roof and Tesla unwilling to install a new one.

That kind of non-service sucks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/nkf409/my_experience_with_tesla_solar_roof_installation/,cryptoengineer,222975.0,-0.3804
TeslaMotors,complaint,bbemnc,A complaint and a bug? About auto pilot,"Complaint:

It seems that autopilot relies on the other party to make the first move when changing lanes. 

For example, I was coming up to my exit. There was another car in the lane looking to merge onto the freeway. I was sitting for quite a long time pacing with the car next to me waiting for the car to change lanes on its own. Instead of speeding up to pass, or slowing down to let the other car by, it just kept pacing at the same speed and nearly causing me to miss my exit and the other car to be forced back off the freeway. 

&#x200B;

Bug:

When the car turns on the turn signal, it also displays a warning in the exact location it also asks you to apply pressure to the wheel to confirm you are still present. This is an issue because the lane change warning covers the live person check alert. Twice now this has caused auto pilot to disengage because I had just pressed the wheel and was watching traffic off to the side to ensure I wasn't about to side swipe someone by changing lanes, like a good driver. I look back to see the warning still there saying it is going to change lanes at any moment, but I also noticed the blue flashing indicating I was supposed to jiggle the wheel. Just there was no indication that I was supposed to.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/bbemnc/a_complaint_and_a_bug_about_auto_pilot/,gummby8,133863.0,-0.5023
TeslaMotors,complaint,m4mhw0,Disorganized Launch of the Model S Refresh,"All,

I would like to preface this by saying that this is not a rant, this is not a complaint, but rather an essay into the disorganized launch of a product that was mentioned to us but once and never followed up on.

**January 28th, 2021:**
Tesla announces the Model S Refresh. I visit the showroom the next day and put my deposit down. I figured if I see the yoke wheel and like it, I can follow through on my order. I requested a Trade-in on my current Tesla and received the same amount as I paid (that however is a different story entirely). My delivery date is set for March 1 - 31.

**February 8th, 2021:**
I receive a phone call from the Tesla Delivery Team. They advised that if I do not fill out my registration information my place in line would be forfeit and my wait for the car would be pushed to May 2021. I then filled out the information, called them back, no answer and sent to the overflow team out in Las Vegas. They advised that my profile looks good and I should be okay.

**February 9th, 2021:**
I receive a text message from the Tesla Delivery Team. This time they are saying the same thing over the phone but it‚Äôs in regards to insurance information. I told them I do not have a VIN and that I cannot fill out or upload anything. She advised to upload ANY insurance. Tesla prioritizes those with all information filled out. I was told again, if I did not, someone else would be prioritized over me and my car would be pushed to May.

**February 10th, 2021:**
I get a phone call from Tesla Delivery at my local service center. They advised that all my information looks good, but guess what. I need to apply for financing. I asked how long the approval would last and they told me ‚Äúmore than enough time as your scheduled to get the car starting from March 1st‚Äù. I told them I was uncomfortable with applying for a car when I did not have a VIN. She told me that she understood and that if I wanted to push delivery off, I would now need to wait until June. The ‚Äúdemand‚Äù she said is ‚Äúthrough the roof‚Äù. 

**February 11th, 2021:**
I apply for financing. My credit is pulled 4 times.

**February 12th, 2021:**
I am approved for financing from Chase and Wells Fargo. Financing team chose the one with the better rate. I now have ALL information filled out on my profile.

**February 13th:**
My delivery date of March 1-31st has disappeared from my Tesla Account. There is no information, just the ‚Äú-‚Äú by ‚ÄúEstimated Delivery Date‚Äù.

**February 16th:**
My attempt to reach my local sales center is in vain. On all attempts I am forwarded to the overflow team in Vegas who have been nothing but nice and patient with me. Unfortunately their knowledge is limited. They advised that they still see the delivery date of March 1-31st and that they would ping my sales advisor.

**From that day on until now:**
My Sales Advisors know nothing (not their fault). Overflow center maintains their stance of a delivery of March 1st - 31st but their optimism wanes as we are almost half way into March. My financing expires on April 12th and with each day that passes, my Sales Advisor becomes less and less available as he does not have any new information to report.

I have emailed ‚Äúordersupport@tesla.com‚Äù thinking I would reach someone outside of my Sales Advisory team but that email was just forwarded to him. Tesla‚Äôs lack of care and lack of communication has turned me off to the point that I am left with a bad taste in my mouth.

On my Tesla Account, I have a Model S, two Model Y‚Äôs, one Model 3. I have a Model S on order and a Model X on order as well. I am not here to brag and I am not here to complain about a company that has provided great service up until now.

I have all but exhausted all of my options. Calling yields no results. Emails just get bounced around with no communication regarding my order. People are pinged by other people and my issue is passed from person to person until someone calls or texts me saying that ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get the car when I get the car‚Äù.

I would not be writing this if they hadn‚Äôt used the ‚ÄúDo this now or else‚Äù tactic. Especially when it effects my credit.

I understand that I am not the only one who is in this predicament. There are other people who are in similar, if not the same exact situation. My hope is that someone here can see this and enable Tesla to release some kind of communication regarding our orders. We know Tesla is capable of deliveries and keeping up with great customer support, but this should not be allowed to happen to me or anyone else.

If Tesla is to remain the great company that it is, they should work to improve and we as customers are here to remind them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/m4mhw0/disorganized_launch_of_the_model_s_refresh/,samgabbay94,25245.0,0.9912

TeslaMotors,complaint,u2zlqu,I just drove half-way across the US in my Tesla. Here are some takeaways.,"## Background

I just drove from roughly Denver to the Adirondack region in upstate New York over four days with a stop over in Chicago to meet up with my parents. I have a new 2022 Model Y (not the brand new battery though) that had about 300 miles on it before this trip and hadn't even seen a charger outside of the one I had installed at home.

I slept in the car for a night on the way, visited some super chargers and non-super chargers, and mostly let the car drive itself. Here are a few observations. AMA.

## Autopilot

Autopilot is GREAT! I paid for FSD, but it still isn't unlocked for me (looking into that). Regardless, for most of this trip I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. The car just drove itself on the highway and even off-highway through the winding roads in upstate NY for the most part. I had to (or felt I had to) take over occasionally, but I was able to stay on the road longer and arrived less stressed than normal because I just didn't need to do much at all with the car. It was great!

Honestly, if I knew that going into it, I probably would have saved the money and not gotten FSD, especially considering I don't have access to it yet; although I assume that will change. I guess I should update this statement once I have access to it and have used it a bit; I'm sure it's life changing.

## Sleeping

The car is pretty comfortable just by itself. I know there are some solutions out there for mattresses to make it more comfortable (TesMat for one), but I was able to crash in a rest area for a few hours no problem with just a sleeping bag. I had a camping mat too, but it turns out some holes had developed and it wouldn't hold air. Alas.

The car only used 2% of battery for 5 hours of sleeping, so that's pretty impressive. I had done an experiment before my drive and found that the car was mostly using about half a percent per hour in camp mode, but that's probably going to depend on the temperature differential between your car and the outside air, whether you're streaming media, etc. I just kept the car at 65-66 F and slept, so nothing much running except the air. It was in the high 30s to 40s F outside during that time.

I would recommend bringing an eye mask if you have to sleep in a rest area. They're usually pretty well lit, and the car is so open feeling it would be pretty bright in there without one.

## Charging

Super chargers are great! I have a Tesla charger installed on its own 40 A circuit at my house, but those super chargers are an order of magnitude faster! I was pretty blown away.

I did encounter one super charger in the rain (not sure if that's related) that seemed to be bugging out and caused my car to do some weird things until I reset it (press both steering wheel buttons for a bit) twice! That one kept connecting and disconnecting according to the car, and my steering wheel buttons and touch screen became less responsive. Also, the blind spot cameras stopped showing up (black screen instead), the radio and streaming services went offline...it was weird! It was the only time I saw any weirdness, but it was definitely weird.

I would recommend that anyone traveling use the PlugShare app if they are in an area without many super chargers. The Adirondacks don't really have any super chargers, but there are plenty of other options in the area that show up on PlugShare. It's made keeping the car charged up out here a lot easier and also gave me more confidence in driving into areas that are further away from the Tesla-navigation-preferred options.

Charging on a regular 120 V house outlet is slooooow, but it does get the job done. I've done it a couple of times now on this trip, and it's fine if you know you can leave the car for long periods between uses, but not ideal if you are trying to charge up to cover some distance. Depending on the house I was plugged into, I saw 1 kWh and 4-5 mi/h peak charge rate. I get 8 kWh from my installed home charger, and waaaaay more from super chargers.

## Pace

One concern of mine was how far behind my parents I would be between Chicago and upstate NY. They were driving in a Toyota SUV, regular gas engine, so I figured they would have faster refueling stops and likely get an hour or so ahead of me each day. They ended up getting to our hotel on their first night, my third, about a half hour before me, and arrived at our final destination ten minutes before me. I took my time at charging stations to give myself a bit of buffer, so I'd say it was pretty darn comparable!

I typically drove about 2-3 hours between charging stations, which seems comparable to what I would do in my Subaru with gas before the Tesla. The stops were longer for charging than gas, but I honestly really appreciated the slower pace of the stops. I had more time to get out, walk around, stretch, eat something, use the facilities, etc. If I were traveling with my dogs I'm sure they would love the longer breaks and more walking too. Really no complaints there.

## Navigation

I will say that the navigation sometimes seems a little wonky. It liked to plan my route from the beginning and then keep it static, even if I took extra time and could make it to a later charger or something. It also doesn't really know when you want to stop and, for instance, keep the car in camp mode for a few hours, so you need to consider that. Occasionally, I had to just clear the nav and re-enter my destination to get it to recalculate stops for me. Not a big deal, but something to be aware of.

## Overall

I really love this thing for road trips now. It's so much easier to drive a car that mostly drives itself! The longer stops are actually kind of great, and I'm usually able to make it 2-3 hours between stops, which is about when I need to go to the bathroom anyway, so that works out. I'm sure the future will see more and more charging stations set up all over the place, but as-is the regular Tesla navigation paired with PlugShare seems to get the job done with no concern.

## Edit: a couple of issues

OK, so after writing this I thought about the trip some more, and there were a few issues I had besides the wonky charging station and the car acting funny after that. They all had to do with autopilot/FSD (not sure if it's FSD, but somebody in the comments said it sounded like standard FSD). The car seems to really not want to drift out of the lane for construction, even when cones are set up to block all but half a lane so you have to drive on the shoulder some. This happened a few times, and I just had to take manual control, with the car yelling at me about lane departures until it gave up. Kind of annoying.

The other one, and this one I think is actually a safety issue, is that the autopilot sometimes just gets into its mind that the speed limit is like 30 mph less than the posted limit. It hit the brakes on me pretty hard a few times with no obstruction or traffic in front. I just took control and sped back up, but if I was in traffic with somebody right behind me when that happened? Could have been bad. For the crazy number of hours I drove, it didn't happen very much, but it definitely freaked me out the few times it did.

When letting the car change lanes for you when it hasn't decided to do so, you can hold down on the turn signal until you're in the new lane or at least mostly there. The issue here was that if you released the turn signal a *little bit* too early, the car would swerve back into the original lane. This happened quite a bit until I got the hang of it. I understand the reasoning behind this---interpret the driver stopping the signal as an abort and get the heck out of that lane change---but the behavior is probably alarming to others on the road, and definitely to me when I wasn't expecting it (which was always). 

The only other thing was minor and didn't affect driving at all, just the UI. The lane change graphic would pop up and disappear rapidly sometimes, over and over again, until I got close enough to a car in the slow lane that it made up its mind that I should actually pass. This one just seems like a filtering issue: don't ask if I want to change lanes until you're pretty sure I should, but it was a bit of a distraction.

So yeah, not perfect, but still great overall, and I have to assume it will only get better as software updates come through. I still stand by my previous statement. I love this car now for road trips.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/u2zlqu/i_just_drove_halfway_across_the_us_in_my_tesla/,DrSparkle713,42973.0,0.9995

TeslaMotors,complaint,sqfzd4,Observations as a new Model S Plaid owner,"As the title says, I‚Äôm the proud new owner of a blue Model S Plaid. I‚Äôm coming from a giant Toyota Tundra that got about 12 miles to the gallon so this is all very new to me. I‚Äôd never even driven a Tesla until I took my car off the lot. 

I wanted to share some observations in case there was anyone else interested and also ask this community of experts some questions:

* This thing is fast. Even in sport mode it will push you back in the seat hard when accelerating aggressively. Oddly, where I notice the power the most is going up steep hills. This thing sort of scoffs at them which is great being in the Seattle area. 

* The yoke is a non-issue for me. I was used to it in the first mile. The Tesla dealership recommended I use the sport setting so I have to move it less and this seems to be a great call. 

* The regenerative braking takes some getting used to. Not using the actual brake pedal in almost all instances is an adjustment. 

* I had read horror stories about build quality issues but the 2022 looks to be done right. Only one minor paint chip which they are fixing next week. No complaints. Stuff happens

* The infotainment screen is unlike anything I‚Äôve ever seen in a car (especially coming from Toyota‚Äôs laughable En-Tune system). It is very responsive and the number of settings and preferences is mind boggling.

* Autopilot and Navigate on Autopilot works flawlessly but despite all the videos I watched actually using it was anxiety provoking the first few times. I still haven‚Äôt used auto lane change yet. 

* Charging was one of my main concerns. But there are Charge Point stations at my work and even my regular outlet gives me enough charge to recoup my daily driving. Though I having a 50 amp outlet put in week after next. 

* The audio is fantastic and although it goes to 11 (lol) I‚Äôve not needed to go past 4. The inclusion of Spotify is so useful and way easier than controlling it via Bluetooth and a rudimentary interface on my old Toyota. I can‚Äôt go back. 

At this point I really only have a few complaints:

* The things you plug the seat belts into in the back seats were designed by Lucifer himself to torment people with kids in booster seats. Yes, there are extensions you can buy, but researchers unanimously say this is unsafe for booster seats. Is there any way on earth to pull these out further?

* My kids can‚Äôt reach the rear entertainment screen from their booster seats. They just aren‚Äôt long enough. There also doesn‚Äôt seem to be a way to select media to play back there from the front screen (say for the passenger to select while driving). If I can cast video from my phone to my TV why can‚Äôt I do similar to the back screen? Am I missing something?

Overall, I‚Äôm incredibly happy with the car. I can work around those two issues but for a car that seems like everything was obsessively considered, I don‚Äôt understand why they exist in the first place‚Ä¶..",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/sqfzd4/observations_as_a_new_model_s_plaid_owner/,noneroy,252370.0,0.9924
TeslaMotors,complaint,9irh2a,"Seeing the world in autopilot, part deux","Greetings from first international Tesla hacking conference in Paris. It‚Äôs been awhile since our last report, lots of things happened since then.

First of all, credit where credit is due, all the awesome visualizations you‚Äôll see below are thanks to u/DamianXVI.

One of the more important happenings is by a sheer stroke of luck the hw2.5 ape we bought off Ebay for research turned out to be a fully unlocked developer version.

The importance of this development is that due to security overhaul on the autopilot computer by Tesla, since about end of 2017, it became near impossible to maintain any sort of presence there. And ever since I lost my original model X with the rooted APE, information about inner workings has been quite sparse.

Now fully unlocked unit changes all of this since it allows any modifications to be performed and so it‚Äôs really pure gold from research perspective. But there‚Äôs more, developer firmware it came with while old, also provided some important insights into various data collection and ‚Äúdashcam operations‚Äù.

https://i.imgur.com/bKtdwOI.jpg 

https://i.imgur.com/PQtWE7k.jpg

You could just plug an SSD into the usb-c port on the side and record footage:

https://i.imgur.com/dUVAHeh.jpg

So we proceeded to gather a bunch of footage from volunteer cars around the world and certain metadata and then u/DamianXVI found ways to correlate some of the metadata with real world meanings and came up with code to paint internal autopilot state (the parts we understand) on top of camera footage (development firmware the unit came with did not include its own visualizer binary). So keep in mind our visualizations are not what Tesla devs see out of their car footage and we do not fully understand all the values either (though we have decent visibility into the system now as you can see). Since we don‚Äôt know anybody inside Tesla development, we don‚Äôt even know what sort of visual output their tools have.

Footage we present has been recorded on firmware 18.34 from the main camera. The green fill at the bottom represents ‚Äúpossible driving space‚Äù, lines denote various detected lane and road boundaries (colors represent different types, actual meaning is unknown for now). Various objects detected are enumerated by type and have coordinates in 3D space and depth information (also 2D bounding box, but we have not identified enough data for a 3D one), correlated radar data (if present) and various other properties. If you are somebody in the know about all of the extra values and can give us a hand ‚Äì shoot me a mail/PM, we have many questions (Thanks!)

While there are various traces of code to work with ‚Äúlocalized maps‚Äù and recognition of traffic control devices, their state, stop lines and so on ‚Äì none of that seems to be enabled in 18.34. Also side cameras are not really used it appears, other than for light level detection.

A note about colors ‚Äì cameras are not fully color, so there‚Äôs some interpolation color so that you just have a bit of an idea how things look like, though they are quite a bit off most likely. The autopilot itself does not really care about the colors.

Periodic picture breakage is due to the racy way we access the camera image buffers so sometimes it changes while we get it.

I am presenting two kinds of footage today, they are kind of long, but we wanted to show diverse situations so bear with us.

Paris highways:

https://youtu.be/24dRkHdpEPo

Highlights if you don‚Äôt want to see all of it:
3:55 ‚Äì even on ‚Äúhighways‚Äù gore area is apparently considered driveable? While technically true it‚Äôs probably not something that should be attempted.
4:08 ‚Äì gore zone surrounded by bollards is correctly showing up as undriveable.
11:47 ‚Äì you can see a bit of a hill crest with the path over it (Paris is not super hilly it appears so hard to demonstrate this on this particular footage)

Object type is shown in text and also by the box color (to easier tell object types far away) ‚Äì purple of truck, yellow for pedestrian, green for bicycle, blue for motorcycle and red for a general ‚Äúvehicle‚Äù object types. The percentage value after the type is some sort of a confidence, probably confidence in that the object is what the software thinks it is? The lane location information and distance seems to come from the vision network and is sometimes wrong. The moving state of the object comes from radar. It should be noted that the distance and relative speed are detected by pure visual means though, since they are pretty accurate even for objects without radar return.

Orange transparent ‚Äúribbon‚Äù denotes idea of how the autopilot thinks it should continue forward from there on (or so we think, it‚Äôs some sort of path planning apparently. It is given in 3D space and we u/DamianXVI tried to overlaid it on 2D space as closely as could be done currently with the limited knowledge we have) ‚Äì this is really advanced, note on the hills it goes up and down ‚Äì this is why AP2+ is better on hilly roads than AP1.

The lane and direction information is only shown for objects that are closer than 60m not to overclutter the screen in busy settings.

Also while this does not look like super deep progress to some I am sure (like no 3D boxes and all that stuff being a frequent complaint), keep in mind this is the first 3rd party independent verification of any self-driving system ever (except for comma.ai perhaps?), sure we all saw great PR videos from Waymo, MobilEye and such, but we also saw an FSD video from Tesla in 2016 that turned out to be mostly a PR stunt. The image does show various advanced features (The path planning, the lines on the roads are not just from the markings on the pavement ‚Äì keep close attention and you‚Äôll see various turn lanes are detected before the markings are shown, though there are false positives too).

Additionally, we thought others might have ideas about some interesting scenarios to test and we might be able to take some requests. Things like stopped firetrucks and the like perhaps?

For people that are interested in testing something in particular settings on a particular firmware version and are willing to provide a test car (mcu1 with preferably hw2.5, we might be able to make hw2.5 unit work in hw2.0 car, but so far this is a theoretical possibility that was not tried) ‚Äì we can install any necessary firmware version and record test footage like the one above, feel free to contact us as well!

It's too bad Tesla is so secretive about their progress in the area and that we need to resort to these measures to shed at least some light on the progress. Hopefully this will prompt Tesla to also make some official footage available?

To be continued with further research?

TeslaMotors,complaint,ylcm2k,One Year & 17k Miles Later with Model 3 LR,"I'm just about to hit a year with my Model 3 LR and just wanted to write a quick review for anyone considering purchasing one. 

I'm going to briefly touch on the most common questions I've heard and the experience I had with it. I'll keep it brief. 

First of all, I absolutely love the car, it's easily the most fun car I've ever owned, hands down. I constantly hear, ""It's built like a $20k car!"". Absolute non-sense! Have you driven a $20k car in 2022? I may be lucky but I've had zero issues with the car, other than a camera change, which was free and done at my home, while I was on vacation. Zero complaints!

Having everything on the center screen is great, I know many people complain about no buttons but there is a reason they aren't on our phones any more. Takes a bit to get use to, and by a bit I mean about 30min of driving. My brother drove it when he picked me up from the airport and said ""Very confusing, until you actually drive it, also how do you turn it off!"" Poor soul spent 30min googling trying to figure it out before he called me. 

Autopilot is great but I wouldn't spend a penny on FSD. I like to drive (zoom zoom) so I don't use it often but on long trips, what a god send. I remember a 4hr ride home, very hung over and thanking GOD for AP. It really does a great job staying in the lane and being comfortable. I've had maybe a few phantom breaks but almost all were when I first got it a year ago, total of maybe five light breaks for no reason but it's been nonexistant for a long time. 

Range is great, I absolutely needed the LR Model when I got the car but with a job change I no longer drive as much. I do feel like the range is a bit exaggerated, but not as much as people like to talk about. Currently I have about 97.5% battery capacity, so my max range is about 344 miles, which is still above the S+ and many other cars 100% range. Winter does take a big hit on range, I don't charge the car above 70% during the summer, but winter I bump to 80% so I can precondition and reduce the drop off of having a cold battery, but even with that reduction, I can drive from Rochester to Buffalo roundtrip, and make it hope without worry. I average about 260wh/mi, so right inline with the average, but it does go up in the winter to close to low 300s if I remember correctly. Typically, I use hrs vs miles when talking about range. About 3hrs on the highway before I charge, between 4-5hrs of driving when it's around town. I can usually charge from 30% to 70%, twice a week. 

I'm surprised at how little I use superchargers, I figured it would be a more common occurrence, but I haven't used one since April for a roadtrip. In the past 30 days, I used 338kwh for $41 charging at home, I don't notice it, that's not even one tank of gas. I will say, if you can't charge at home, I'd reconsider it, plugging in overnight is key to saving money. 

My wife and I share the car, we reduced from two Equinox leases to just the one Tesla and went from one kid, to two. We can fit both car seats plus bags in the back. We have room in the fronk, the extra storage in the trunk helps greatly. Even with all that we can still fit our two kid stroller in the trunk. I'm not going to lie and say it isn't tight, but it's very manageable for the few times we pack up. 

End of story, a year later, no complaints, range is fine even with battery decay, it's worth a good chunk more than what I bought it for after 17k miles, there's a reason for that. I get compliments left and right and I've had my car enthusiast friend ride in it and even drive it and they are BLOWN away!

TeslaMotors,complaint,no03zw,Vision Only AP + Rain Experience,"I just picked up a M3LR today in NJ, where it has been raining on and off all day. Figured I would share some quick experiences with vision only AP in these conditions. Keep in mind this is my first Tesla and first use of AP outside of a very short test drive pre pandemic, so I don‚Äôt have much to compare to

Running 2012.4.15.11

Auto Windshield Wipers - Honestly, almost no complaints at all. Did a very good job alternating between speeds between downpours, light rain, and water kicked up from other vehicles on the road. A few times it went faster than necessary for a minute but eventually slowed down 

Rain - it did a decent job in the rain, *As long as there were no cars in front of me.* As soon as I was driving on sections of the highway that tend to kick up more of a cloud of water behind vehicles in front of you, I would get plagued with Reduced Visibility alerts, the car would start slowing down pretty quickly, and then eventually alert for immediate takeover. I got at least 10 of these on a 30 mile stretch of high way. Honestly, AP / TACC was nearly useless when the road was wet, even if it wasn‚Äôt actually raining. 

General AP - It stayed in the center of the lane super well. Very little ping ponging at all. Took curves nice and smooth. Noticed a few times it would visualize 2 cars in front as long as it could get a glimpse. Overall super impressed with lane keep when it was in ideal conditions

It did seem a little heavy footed as soon as gaps opened. Maybe I‚Äôm just used to driving a Prius, but it did seem a little aggressive in speeding up when it could. Same with slowing down when vehicles are stopped or driving way slower in front of you, IE upcoming traffic or a red light. It didn‚Äôt seem to anticipate *too* far ahead, often accelerating up to traffic only to immediately start breaking again. 

I noticed that the car would start to creep forward when light turned green when I was a few cars back, even when the car in front of me hadn‚Äôt started moving yet. Felt like a very human action 

As for some general delivery experience, it was absolutely down pouring when I picked it up so I didn‚Äôt get a great chance to really look it over. SA said I have 100 miles to report anything via the app that needs addressed. From a quick glance I feel my hood is not well aligned, even on one side but dips below on the other. Also the A-Pillar alignment seems a bit off. And one of my Aero caps wasn‚Äôt fully attached to the wheel which I thought was odd but popped it right back on. I also took delivery with 32 miles which seems a bit high to me? Anyone have similar miles on delivery? 

Anyways, that‚Äôs my experience today. Drove about 90 miles as not to go over my 100 before I could report issues. Again, this is my first real day in a Tesla so not sure how much of this is unique to vision only or how much is standard behavior. Tried to call out things that I‚Äôve noticed people talking about and mentioning in my years of lurking.

Hope all of you eagerly awaiting Vins get them soon, cause I sure had a big smile when i stomped on that accelerator for the first time :)

Edit: Sorry for not including any video, it was my first drive and raining so I wanted to pay full attention to the road while learning how the car reacts",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/no03zw/vision_only_ap_rain_experience/,thisisausername67,5104.0,0.9953
TeslaMotors,complaint,z07nh4,10x Tesla Powerwall Failure (Off-grid Setup Australia 240v),"Hey All,  


We've had yet more failures with our system (2AM woken up by our UPS systems beeping due to low battery, due to powerwall 10  min crash+-)  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRjzyXaEuyg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRjzyXaEuyg)

I'm here to provide yet another milestone update, our install was signed off by Tesla, approved as a 10 powerwall off-grid install which by all accounts should work 24/7 unless we either drain the batteries to 0% or there is a system failure.  


Tesla has acknowledged for the past 18 months there is a warranty issue at hand and have occasionally every 2-6 months applied a firmware update advising that there was a change to address our issue, on each account it has failed.  


Our most recent firmware update was done two days ago which was supposed to take less than an hour, ended up having over 50 powercycles, failures during update process destroying our powered gate transformer, we have had pool pumps, air con fans, pc's break due to the frequent power cycles.  


We're still awaiting compensation after asking numerous times for such and expressing severe disappointment with the system.  


After 18 months of perpetual issues with our off-grid install (hundreds of crashes, multiple firmware revisions) we are now striving for a full system-refund and removal, or we'll be finally taking Tesla to court in Australia.  


Gdnight, it's 2:30 now downunder and I should try get back to sleep

TeslaMotors,complaint,u0lf9o,2018 Model 3 LR 50k Miles Report,"We ordered our Model 3 in November 2018 and picked it up 1.5 weeks later. This car has been a blast to drive and has had 0 issues after all this time. With that in mind, here are some numbers you might be interested in knowing:

- Battery range:

With an original range of 315 miles, it is currently sitting 270, an 85% retainment of the battery capacity. It‚Äôs okay for us because we never charged it to the max anyways. The battery has had 0 flaws; never needed any repairs.

- Maintenance costs:

We took the car in for service twice to change cabin air filters and top off brake fluid for a total price of $150. We also replaced the tires (surprisingly at 30,000 miles) for $850. It would have been more expensive if we were to purchase it from Tesla, so we purchased them from Costco. The car did not need any other repairs as it came in with 0 flaws. The service center also replaced the 12v battery twice and replaced the charge port insulator pins with updated parts free of charge (since they are covered under warranty). We were also surprised to see that we were only charged $9.50 for labor for brake fluid top off (it was recommended to get checked; we got it checked; they might have also not topped it off and only checked it since they charged us $9.50 for it); they covered the price for the actual fluid. Overall, we spent $1000 for tires and other preventative maintenance, which is lower than the cost for any other car we ever owned.

- Charging:

This car is a pure CA car. We have had 0 issues driving it anywhere. The car has been up and down the west coast, along the PCH and along the desert roads with 0 charging issues. We charge the car overnight at home and at work, and use the supercharger network for vacations. We have spent $250-300 for charging overall despite going up and down the state. In comparison to an ICE car, this car has saved us a lot in gas money.

- Overall:

We love our model 3. It is safe and tons of fun to drive. It has 0 wind noise and has costed $0 in emergency repairs. There is no oil change that you have to pay for, which on its own saves some money. If you are worried about the costs for this car or the car breaking down on you, don‚Äôt be! The quality of the car you pick up might be different, but you will have lots of fun with it and will be happy with your choice. Just know that you may be replacing your tires early since the rear motor is more powerful than the front motor. As the Costco tire center guy said, ‚ÄúTeslas love to eat tires.‚Äù

Edit: We get electricity at home for free since we have solar panels. Thank you for pointing it out!

Edit 2: I must mention that in-car connectivity is $10 per month, which gets added to the total cost of the car",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/u0lf9o/2018_model_3_lr_50k_miles_report/,Mike20172018,20935.0,0.9908
TeslaMotors,complaint,reu9ss,First 24hrs with my Model Y Performance (spoiler: full motor failure),"**Backstory**

I've always been into cars, and I was looking to get a new vehicle as my winter/practical car. I'm keeping my S4 and 718 Cayman S as well, so this was going to be in addition to those 2. I've been in enough Audi/BMW/Mercs/Porsches and wanted something different. Smooth power, roomy interior, cool factor and quiet ride were my main considerations. I don't need the all out performance of something like an X3M or GLC63 since I've got other cars. I wanted this to be a stark contrast to my current 2 vehicles.

&nbsp;

Decided a MYP would be a good fit, especially with very strong resale value. I can keep it for a few years and see what the electric market is like with Rivian, electric Macan etc. The ordering and delivery process was terrible, but that's another story. It was easily the worst ""dealership"" experience I've had buying any car (new or used).

&nbsp;

Anyways, I get my car on the evening of Dec 10th. By the afternoon of the 11th, it had a rear motor failure followed by a completely dead vehicle that's unable to drive. 

&nbsp;

**Motor Failure** 

Picked up my blue on white MYP on the evening of Dec 10th. By the afternoon of the 11th, it had a [rear motor failure](https://imgur.com/FqTE42h) and 2 mins later was [completely undriveable](https://imgur.com/2NQjz3W) and had to be towed to the dealer. It was being driven at 60km/h when a warning came up about the rear motor. A couple mins later, it was fully dead. Luckily I was near a friends house and parked it in their driveway. Would have sucked if this happened on the highway. I googled the error and it seems like this has happened to other people before, and usually pretty soon after delivery. Still, off too a pretty terrible start with the car.

&nbsp;

Bad things I've noticed over the first 24hrs, coming from someone who's into cars and driven a bunch of stuff on street/track:

&nbsp;

**Build Quality:** Wasn't expecting much here, so I was ok with some gaps and not having perfect panels. There was some glue residue on the edges of the panoramic roof, and there were marks on the headliner when I took delivery. The interior plastic piece on the b pillar has a massive gap between it and the roof on 1 side. Otherwise, I'm totally ok with it. I knew what I was getting into and wasn't expecting it to be on the level of the germans.

&nbsp;

**Closing the Door:** You have to pull pretty hard to actually close the door. It wasn't just me either. Multiple people failed to close the door properly the first time they tried. You really have to slam it more than any other car I've owned. Not a very nice experience for the user. I can imagine some older person actually having trouble to close it properly.

&nbsp;

**Honk Upon Lock:** I can't believe this car makes a cheap honk sound when you lock it like some early 2000s GM car. It should 100% have some pleasant sounding chip/beep. 

&nbsp;

**Loud Seat Motors:** Loudest seat motors I've heard, especially the lumbar.

&nbsp;

**Cheap Carpet Mats:** I've already installed proper mats, but the stock carpet mats (only included for driver and passenger) are the thinnest and cheapest feeling carpet mats I've experienced. They're so lightweight and flimsy with no impression of quality. This doesn't matter too much, but it speaks to the cost cutting happening everywhere.

&nbsp;

**Can't View Songs on Phone?** Unless I'm dumb, is there actually no way to view a list of all music on my iPhone and pick something? The interface between phone and the car is terrible and super limited. I really hope I'm missing something here. There isn't even an easy way to activate Siri since the in-car voice button will trigger the Tesla voice assistant. Very disappointed in the user experience here.

&nbsp;

**Flimsy Sunshades:** Once again, more cost cutting. You can easily feel the cardboard inside them. There is absolutely no feeling of quality when operating them. There's also a little flap of fabric that covers the mirror instead of a sliding piece of plastic or plastic cover. Feels like something I'd expect in a $10k car.

&nbsp;

**Very Unrefined Suspension:** This is probably my biggest ""real"" complaint. It feels like shit. There is no sense of money or R&D put into it. It's so crashy when driving and you can literally hear creaks and noises from the suspension being transmitted into the vehicle while driving (with the music off). The dampening feels like crap and there's no reason for this car to ride this terribly. I bet you an A class has a more upscale feeling suspension. No adaptive dampening available is also a joke. I expected this based on some reviews, but it's next level bad. My Cayman S with Sport PASM feels light years ahead in suspension setup. Maybe if you're coming from a Civic or Camry this is acceptable to you, but if you've driven any modern car from a luxury brand, this is appalling. 

&nbsp;

**Headliner:** I'm probably just spoiled, but I thought most cars nowadays had a fabric headliner. Not the MYP. It looks like fabric, but when you touch it, it's a nasty cheap plastic type of material. Come on, I get you have to cut costs, but this is nearly $100k after tax in Canada. 

&nbsp;

**Auto Dimming Mirrors:** These work well enough, but the portion of the mirror that auto dims is small. There is a thick border around the auto-dim part of the mirror, where it's normal and reflective. I've never had another car where it stands out this much. You can almost be blinded by lights in this outer border since it's so chunky. It should definitely extend more towards the edges of the mirror.

&nbsp;

**HomeLink Garage Opener:** Just another example of more cost cutting. Even Porsche gives this to you. I'm sure it's Tesla being cheap and not wanting to pay the license fee to HomeLink for every car sold. I know they offer it as a dealer accessory for like $400, but come on.

&nbsp;

**Straight Line Speed:** It's actually not as fast as I expected. If you're not used to fast cars, this will feel like a space ship. If you're driven modern performance cars, it's nothing special. I feel like the MYP has an adequate amount of power. I feel like it needs another 100hp to be classified as a proper performance variant. My other cars both feel just as fast and launch significantly harder with launch control. The MYP rolls into the power softly from a dig. When you're rolling, it does feel great - but so does any other modern fast car if you're in the right gear.

&nbsp;

**Blind Spot Monitoring:** It's just sad that the car doesn't have true blind spot monitoring like every other modern car. I knew it didn't have it (the chime/assist thing is garbage vs a proper system) so I was prepared for this, but just 1 more thing it's missing.

&nbsp;

**Rear Visibility:** Terrible due to the slope of the rear glass. Worse than all its competitors. I'm ok with this but some people might not be.

&nbsp;

**Heated Steering Wheel:** It seems to cycle on/off to regulate the temperate. The problem is that it's either nice and toasty or very noticeably colder when it turns off. I wish it be consistent. It's a stark contrast and very noticeable as it turns on and off while attempting to maintain a warm wheel.

&nbsp;

**Auto High Beam:** Very inconsistent and basically unusable in my short night time testing. I live near some rural roads with a single lane in each direction and it wasn't very sure about when to turn the high beams on/off. I ended up turning it off after getting fed up with the system. 

&nbsp;

Good things about the car:

&nbsp;

**Smoothness:** I love how smooth it is with no transmission. This is exactly what I wanted. Both my other cars have a DCT and they get pretty clunky in the winter when cold. It's very nice not to feel any shifts. Smoothness also goes for power delivery. It's not as fast as I expected, but I love how smooth it feels when accelerating. 

&nbsp;

**Quietness:** I was on the fence about this before getting the car. I expected it to be very loud on the highway based on some things I've read. I was very happy with the cabin volume and found it to be much quieter than expected. Maybe I'm just used to louder performance cars and that's why I think this is quiet, but regardless, I think interior noise is totally acceptable for what the car is.

&nbsp;

**Interior Space:** This thing is massive inside. I love how much rear seat room you have, all the trunks and under floor storage you have. It feels so nice and airy while driving too. The way the windows are positioned and the drivers seat. I love how open it all feels. The white interior also helps out here.

&nbsp;

**Sound System:** I had read some major complaints so I was expecting the worst. It really isn't that bad. It's half decent. Don't go expecting 7 series or S class quality, but I think it's totally acceptable for this class of vehicle. Those complaints were way overblown to me. I'm using bluetooth streaming from my iPhone which I believe is the 2nd clearest source with USB being the best.

&nbsp;

Overall, I still think it's a decent car. I expected the cost cutting and knew about some of the downsides going into it, but it's always different once you actually own the car. For the reasons I wanted the car, it works well. The suspension is easily the biggest let down. If they give it air suspension, increase power and fix up their UX, I think they could have nearly perfect compact SUV. And offer some kind of luxury package for $5k to make the interior feel more expensive. Nicer headliner, nicer door cards, better carpeting, more sound deadening etc.

&nbsp;

Also, I love to complain and nitpick basically every car, so I'm definitely more critical than most people. Your average buyer coming from a Prius would love this thing inside and out. I realize I'm more spoiled by nicer cars and having spent significant time with luxury brands.

&nbsp;

Lmk if you guys have any questions! Happy to answer them.

&nbsp;

**Edit: replying to some basic questions. Will do more individual responses later on.**

Yes, I'm still happy with the purchase. I knew what I was getting into. I just wanted to share my experience as someone who owns my current 2 cars (2017 Cayman S and 2012 Audi S4 w/ tune).

&nbsp;

Straight line speed: I have dragy numbers for all 3 cars. With NO rollout:

718 Cayman S - 4.13 seconds

Audi S4 w/ tune - 4.32 seconds

Model Y Performance - 4.10 seconds

With rollout, all 3 cars are easily in the 3 second range. Numbers on paper don't always reflect what a car feels like in real life. I'm just saying that I expected the Y Performance to feel faster off the line vs combustion cars, but in reality it's nearly identical if you mash the throttle. Again, compared to the 2 cars I own. I'm not saying it's slow, but it's a speed I'm used to and find adequate. It doesn't feel like it's crazy fast. It IS very nice for passing power while cruising.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/reu9ss/first_24hrs_with_my_model_y_performance_spoiler/,FazedCow,12918.0,0.998

TeslaMotors,complaint,s8ya33,FSD Beta 10.9 Write up - Significantly better,"2017 Model X 100D w/ AP 2.5 cameras

FSD Beta's profile was set to ""Average""

This was a Costco run, which I've done a write up before, which can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/qizw8l/fsd_beta_1031_drive_write_up/.

TL;DR: Two drives, one to get to Costco and one to come back.  Zero disengagements on the way to Costco, one disengagement coming home.  No significant complaints from the wife regarding the vehicle's behavior.  *Significant improvement*

[This was the route taken to get to Costco](https://imgur.com/fcLTaBH)

There were zero disengagements.

There were some incidences of note, however.

[At this spot here](https://imgur.com/esa7ykB) I manually changed lanes from the right lane to the left lane, and manually back again, as there were vehicles pulled over at the side of the road.  They weren't on the road, and would not have been in the path of the car, however, Florida law is ""Move over for pulled over"" or something like that.

[This intersection here](https://imgur.com/TyGLDsH), historically, has never worked as desired.  Normally the Tesla fails to see the turn lane in time, and the result is that it just keeps flying forward.  This time it *did* get into the turn lane, but there was a *hard* braking in the process.  When leaving the intersection and turning left the car accelerated hard into the car ahead of us, which was weird, but it maintained the safety distances.

[This intersection here](https://imgur.com/RofL6WG) has also been problematic, mainly because the car seems to time the vehicles wrong.  I had to press the accelerator for the car to go forward through the intersection.  *I think* the issue stems from not seeing turn signals in use.  This intersection is super prone to getting backed up, but more often than not the people at the stop sign are always going straight.  So while the car in front of me ""got there first"" we were both crossing the intersection and not turning into each others paths.  I think the Tesla was waiting for them to ""take their turn"", when from an efficiency standpoint we can both go since neither of us are turning.

The [next intersection](https://imgur.com/k88HPta) I was actually really impressed by.  In my previous write up for 10.3.1 I drew this diagram [here](https://imgur.com/cOwxgT6) to explain my issues, and honestly, they were addressed.  The issue with the intersection is that, technically, Costco *is* a right turn up the road, however, if you get into the right most left turn lane, then you get stopped by any car making a right as they turn.  The *smart* thing to do is to be in the left most left turn lane and then just go by.  And the car did it.  The navigation also basically told it not to take the first right to get to Costco either, it took the back entrance, as I would do.

It did basically choke on the last right turn into the Costco parking lot, but from my stand point it from me from driveway to parking lot entry, and as far as I'm concerned, that was zero disengagements, and beautifully done.

So the trip from home to Costco was near perfect, and zero disengagements.

The trip home used [this route here](https://imgur.com/lEDgXhx), which is *very* similar, but turns down a couple different roads.

Leaving Costco was manual.  I did the maneuver indicated [in this diagram](https://imgur.com/UWinLbV), the red arow was manual driving, and I kicked on Autopilot at the yellow arrow.

*Historically*, when I get to the [next intersection](https://imgur.com/hoio4Ko) the car chokes, because the lane markings are faded, and it starts to drift from the right lane to the left lane in the middle of the turn.  It did not do that this time.  It maintained its lane with no issues.

A manual lane change was needed at [this intersection](https://imgur.com/cmz3Xtk), mainly because the car wants to go straight in the turn lane.  This has been that way since 10.2.  Not a huge issue, and no disengagement was necessary.

[This intersection here](https://imgur.com/gm6YBUZ) is where the the single disengagement occurred.  Traffic for the light was backed up to the yellow line.  The car became impatient and tried to get into the left turn lane.  I can understand the error, there's no lane markings to denote that the left lane is ""turn only"" that far back.  The wheel jerked hard to the left and because I had my hand on it, it disengaged.  Once we got moving again I re-engaged it and we kept going.

[This intersection here](https://imgur.com/kO9GSoz) almost got us T-boned.  The car had to make a left turn, and there was a car blocking out sight line where the yellow line is.  The green line indicates where the car that was coming toward us was.  My visibility was blocked due to the car indicated by the yellow line.  Had I been driving I would've crawled by way through the intersection until I could confirm no one was coming.  We got through the intersection fine, but I'm fairly positive the oncoming car had to tap their brakes a bit.  It wasn't close, plenty of distance and such, but this is also where my wife fussed at me the most about the car's driving.

[This intersection here](https://imgur.com/s3myf5x) was *almost* perfect.  *In my opinion* a stop is not necessary.  We were going through the intersection while the light was red, and the vehicle came to a complete stop at the yellow line.  I believe stopping here is not necessary because a new lane starts here.  Once you complete this turn, you're in a lane of your own, and no one should be in it.  Doesn't mean you take the turn at 50mph or something, but coming to a complete stop is unnecessary, in my opinion.  Ultimately I hit the accelerator and got it going again.

Approaching [this intersection](https://imgur.com/4Kju2fd) was another manual lane change.  The car hasn't been able to do it properly, at least not according to my time frame.  The issue here is that three lanes cross the intersection, but the right most lane ends right after you cross.  *Typically* what happens is that you cross and you almost come to a complete stop from people turning into the gas station, or going to Burger King.  It's easier to get into one of the left two lanes, ideally the left most one, as you cross the intersection to avoid that crap.  I manually made that lane change.

Further on down the road, at [this intersection](https://imgur.com/m5mTrNf) the car slammed the brakes at the white line as a vehicle turned out of the gas station into the adjacent lane.  Ultimately the vehicle was being over protective because the SUV that was leaving was making a wide turn out of there.  I can understand, it was dark, better to be safe than sorry.  Was a little hard though.

*Historically*, when the vehicle made a left turn at [this intersection](https://imgur.com/tkx69aC) it would choke around where the blue line is.  *Every time*, I assume it has been because there's cars trying to make a right turn to get onto the same road and they stop where the orange line is, but this time the car handled it *perfectly*.  No stops, no brakes, just a smooth left turn.

Now, for one of the last turns.  [This spot here](https://imgur.com/a3LyXqG), I've brought this up in most of my write ups because, ever since 10.2 is has been failing here and required an intervention.  The car needs to make a right turn, however, *historically* it's tried to make the right turn too early, and go into the strip mall.  Ever since 10.2 to I've always had to intervene and stop it.  This time, it got through.  I kept an eye on the FSD Beta's blue intention line and I saw it try to make a right turn, then correct itself.  The car did, briefly, try to make a right turn there, but after a moment it was like ""No wait, not there"".  No intervention was necessary, though it does still need to be cleaned up a bit.

From there it was straight home, all the way to my drive way, no interventions.

So, compared to previous iterations of FSD Beta, 10.9 is a huge leap ahead.  This is the first time I've done this kind of trip with zero disengagements in one direction, and only one coming back.

Going to be interesting to see what v11 yields next month.  Even my wife was impressed when we got home.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/s8ya33/fsd_beta_109_write_up_significantly_better/,Nakatomi2010,260413.0,0.93
TeslaMotors,complaint,bivgve,When a hotel valet reverses your 3 into a wall,"I'm still in the middle of this entire headache so looking for any pointers other folks can give on navigating Tesla's departments (read: factions) to get meaningful support.

&#x200B;

I purchased the car in October 10 2018 and in November 3 2018 I drove it from Seattle, WA to Vancouver, BC. I stayed at a well-known international hotel chain in Vancouver Downtown and opted to let the valet park my car. The valet driver reversed the 3 into a wall causing significant rear damage. I got a letter from the hotel where they claimed full responsibility for the collision and made a police report with Vancouver PD.

&#x200B;

After the car was finally brought to a Certified Tesla Body Shop in Bellingham, WA, it sat there for about a week until a Tesla technician came out and identified a blown fuse. After severe parts delays, the car was finally repaired last week but during a software update it failed on the restraint module causing a replacement restraint module to be ordered. It has been in the shop for 5.5 months.

&#x200B;

I've gone and tried to engage my nearest Tesla Service Center to no avail as they do not deal with body damage and do not work directly with Tesla Body Shop Support. Tesla Body Shop Support itself claims they will handle staying on top of the car's repairs with you and stay in touch with you providing you timely updates. I have yet to receive that service and have complained to them over email (since they don't have a direct phone number) multiple times to no avail.

&#x200B;

I reached out to Tesla National Support to file a complaint against the lack of support received through this process and the severe parts delays. No one ever reached back out to me regarding the support case. I reiterated the case by sending it to [support@tesla.com](mailto:support@tesla.com) and [feedback@tesla.com](mailto:feedback@tesla.com) also to no avail.

&#x200B;

I've been in touch with the lawyers representing the hotel around compensation for the diminished value but am unable to get a quote for it from Tesla until the car is actually repaired.

&#x200B;

I've been at a loss for a while as the car has been in a shop for the majority of the time that I've owned it, and I've progressively lost confidence in the body shop's ability to repair the car in a timely manner.

TeslaMotors,complaint,ia0ydn,"A year into my 2019 Long Range, AWD Model 3 - my list of pros and cons","I've had my Model 3 for a little over a year now and wanted to put my pros and cons into a list for anyone looking into get into one themselves. 

Some background to help provide insight into why my pros and cons are my pros and cons - I'm a huge tech enthusiast and live in an area that experiences all four seasons. This is my first EV coming from three Cadillacs and an Audi. I charge at home with a 220 volt outlet and the mobile charger that came with the car. I've only had to supercharge a handful of times and do 99.9% of my charging at home. I opted for the base 18"" rims, base (at the time) black paint, and base black interior. 

Pros

* AutoPilot. This one can't not be at the top of the list. I had to move for work recently and my commute grew from 2 miles round trip to 70. I spend a lot more time in the car and about 90% of my commute is on the highway. The 30 minute drive to and from work feels like nothing because I barely have to do anything - pretty much just get in the car and let it take over. 
* Acceleration/torque/power. Even without the performance model and the $2,000 speed upgrade, there's a good chance I'm the fastest car on the road at a given time. Being able to zoom forward to merge onto the highway or overtake a slow moving car on a two lane road is amazing. Plus, the feeling of my head hitting the head rest has not gotten old yet even a year in.
* Software updates. Some features my car has gotten for free over the last year: faster 0-60 time, games, Netflix, left and right side view camera access when using the backup camera, lane keep assist and lane departure warning, visualization improvements, and more. This is the only car I've ever had that actually gains more in features after you drive it off the lot - and for free. 
* Wow factor. I'll admit, I like the attention to an extent. Watching passengers break their necks to look into my car while cruising along the highway with AutoPilot on and hearing ""where's your engine"" when I pull my backpack out of the frunk when I walk into work in the morning. 
* No gas stations! Starting on a full ""tank"" every day is a point that's not talked about enough. Not to mention the convenience of not having to go to the gas station. 
* Remote control. I LOVE that I can control a lot of the features in my car remotely. My last two Cadillacs and my Audi all had remote lock capabilities and my two Cadillacs had remote start from my smartphone too, but to be able to set the climate, heated seats, vent windows, lock doors, open trunk/frunk from my phone is awesome. Being able to ""start"" it from the app is also a really cool feature if you ever need to let someone move your car while you're away from it with the key.
* Winter driving. This car is over 2 ton. Coupled with all wheel drive and cautious driving, it acted like a tank this past winter. We had maybe 10-15 bad snows throughout the winter and not once did I question my ability to navigate the roads or worry that I'd get stuck somewhere. I didn't use winter tires.

* Instant heat. Coupled with pre-conditioning, I could warm my car up in the colder months 5 minutes before I was ready to take off and the interior would be nice and comfortable for me by the time I was ready. Plus, if it had snowed, it was really nice being able to thaw the front and rear windshields to an extent. 

Cons

* Tesla support. This one goes to the top of the list. Tesla's customer service and support is garbage. Unless MAYBE you live in California and it's a little less garbage. My delivery experience was horrible and trying to get any kind of service for my car has been a joke, without even the option for a loaner vehicle for repairs. Say what you want, but rideshare credits are not going to cut it when I've got an 80 mile trip home from the service center and that 70 mile round trip work commute I mentioned earlier during the week. Tesla has been reluctant to schedule mobile service every time I've requested it and trying to reach someone is next to impossible because they do all of their chatting with you via text. They take days to respond - I'm not kidding. 

* Overall vehicle and paint quality. The driver and passenger rear doors stick out slightly farther than the front doors. It's enough that there are actually paint chips on the little part that sticks out on the back doors from rocks/debris getting kicked up off the road. One year in and the rock chips on the front are AWFUL. I'm afraid to see what it's going to look like after another winter. The paint quality seems pretty poor and a lot of people seem to share the same consensus. There was peeling paint and paint bubbles in two areas on my car at delivery as well. Quality control seems to be an afterthought. Not sure if it's still an issue on the cars coming off the line today, but there were a lot of complaints on this and my Model 3 is no exception. 

* Lack of luxury features for a ""luxury"" car. Compared to my last car, a loaded Audi A4 Prestige trim, this car does not have (nor does any trim level of the Model 3): proper blind spot monitoring, rear cross traffic alert/braking, 360 degree birdseye camera view, handsfree operated rear trunk, head-up display, heated steering wheel, tri-zone climate control, decent ambient interior lighting, XM radio (I will never understand this one, especially since Model S and X have it?), and a bunch of other small things (like cool dynamic sequential rear turn signals, illuminated door sills, projection puddle lamps, and more).

* AutoPilot is far from perfect. I have been flipped off by someone behind me more than once because AutoPilot decided the empty road ahead posed a threat and proceeded to slam on the brakes. The person behind thought I was brake checking them and (rightfully) gave me the finger. Going from a single lane to double lane road is hit or miss, especially if the new lane is a turning lane. Up until recently, my Model 3 would always try to hard swerve into a turning lane instead of continuing straight in the driving lane. 

* Rain sensing wipers and auto high beams may as well not exist. Model 3 does not have a real rain sensor because Tesla decided to save some cash and try to use AI from the cameras that control AutoPilot in the front of the car. Because it doesn't use the normal rain sensor (which uses IR light to detect if there's water on the windshield) like every other car with this feature, the car often gets confused at what wiper speed is necessary for the amount of rain falling and decided it can't go wrong if it just sets the wipers to high speed for a light sprinkle. Sometimes the wipers work decently but I find myself manually controlling them 90% of the time. Tesla - you already missed the boat on a real rain sensor, but maybe give us a sensitivity control? The auto high beams are pretty bad too. It deactivates at signs on the road that reflect the lights from my car but won't turn off when a driver is coming toward me. It's even worse on the highway. If the brights do turn off on their own, the car activates them IMMEDIATELY after the passing car has left the camera, which results in the driver in the opposing lane getting flashed jut as they're passing you. 

* Cold weather = 50% range on full charge. This one sucks. It's not a Tesla problem, it's an EV problem. Heat is a lot more inefficient than A/C so in the winter, even if you have your cabin climate turned off, the energy the car uses to warm the battery is still going to cause pretty significant range loss. There are no superchargers in between me and my family an hour away, so up until I bought a spare mobile charger, my trips home were always filled with worry that I wouldn't have enough charge to make it back, especially if there was a snowstorm or other factor that caused additional drain. 

These are the high level pros and cons that I can think of for now. Not an extensive list by any means but it seems like I've gotten a lot down as it is.

TeslaMotors,complaint,s1h95j,Silenced the Wind Noise!,"Wind noise is a relatively common complaint around this sub, and I‚Äôd like to share my solution with everyone.

I bought [this product](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YRS7S78/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_FZ15167CN2AS9M89SJQW?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1) on Amazon for just under $8. It comes as a paired tubing that very easily pulls apart. The adhesive is sufficiently solid, though I recommend disposing of the first and last couple of inches as the ends were a little bit less sticky for me.

Here‚Äôs the final product with the door [open](https://imgur.com/a/Zob11P3) and [closed](https://imgur.com/a/bvtwo4k).

Total installation time was around five minutes and the wind noise reduction is remarkable. I‚Äôve also noticed a reduction in road surface noise at city street speeds.

TLDR ‚Äì Eliminate wind noise for $8 in five minutes.

EDIT ‚Äì Fixed broken Amazon link.

EDIT ‚Äì The gaps are located at the trunk-facing ends of the front door glass, and on both the frunk-facing and trunk-facing ends of the rear door glass. They are [recessed/sunken in](https://imgur.com/a/gukLrlD). I applied the tubing in all [three locations](https://imgur.com/a/XrVKZyC) on both sides.

EDIT ‚Äì [Video](https://imgur.com/a/Sv9OX8K) as promised.

EDIT ‚Äì One month follow-up! After roughly three weeks the driver side seal started to fall away.

Do keep in mind that the weather in my location has been above freezing only two days since the initial post, and you will likely have better luck in any warmer climate ‚Äì especially as we enter spring.

TeslaMotors,complaint,ej8pom,Abandoned by Tesla after Flat Tire,"Last night on my way home (to the Orange County Area) from San Diego, my Performance Model 3 suffered a flat tire when I hit two potholes driving into a Supercharger station.  I tried to add air to the tire, but I only made it one more mile.  So there I sat with 3 passengers, in front of a closed gas station, without a spare tire... so I called roadside assistance and I was told (as a first option) that (1) getting my family home 100 miles was my problem and that I should use Uber, (2) if I wanted a tow (within the 50 miles Tesla approves), I could not use a Tesla Service Center, and (3) that if I had any complaints or wanted to talk to Alisha‚Äôs Supervisor (no need to give her last time) I had to wait an hour because the supervisor was in a meeting (at 11 pm) for at least an hour.  And oh, yes, I had to send the tow truck driver home.

I want to point out a couple of things:  I did not (and do not) blame Tesla for my flat; I treated the Tesla representative with the utmost respect; and, my complaint is that I was treated as an inconvenience, not a customer in distress.  I would have been happy to pay more to be towed to the Tesla Center or jump through any hoops, but what I did not expect was to be told that Tesla ‚Äúdid not care where I serviced‚Äù my car and that my family was ‚Äúmy problem‚Äù.   Put simply, the entire call was about finding out ways to say no to me without providing a single method to fix my situation.  I was even advised to ‚Äúread my manual‚Äù, which is why I realized that I was allowed to tow my car up to 50 miles if I chose another tire shop, even though the Tesla Service center was down the road.  

I suppose that this is a rant, but I was absolutely shocked by the attitude.  I mean, what is point having roadside assistance that is willing to leave me stranded a hundred miles from home.  I don‚Äôt need roadside assistance to call Uber, I don‚Äôt need roadside assistance to get a tow truck (thank God for AAA), and I don‚Äôt need roadside assistance to make me feel bad about driving a car without a spare, I can do that on my own.  Tesla makes an amazing product, but it really needs to decide whether it wants my Service Business.  I am willing to pay for good service, but I am not willing to be shamed and abandoned while my family sits in an inoperable car, 100 miles from home, in the middle of night.   If nothing else, this is a shout out to AAA and Discount Tires, two companies that really know what its like to want a customer to use them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ej8pom/abandoned_by_tesla_after_flat_tire/,Gambit_13,4541.0,-0.8682
TeslaMotors,complaint,g3qaxa,Went from a C7 Corvette to a Model 3 Performance - 4 months in,"Background - my daily driver was a 2016 Malibu, and my weekend car was a 2017 Corvette. I sold both and got the M3P as a daily driver.

The good -

* 0-60 is fun!
* Handles a lot better than I thought it would.
* The overall experience is great. As a daily driver, It‚Äôs easily the best car I‚Äôve ever driven.
* Autopilot. I drive 25K miles a year. A lot of it in stop-and-go traffic. I under estimated the stress relief. 
* New track mode features are freaking amazing. The ability to bias power to the front or rear wheels, or completely turn them off is great. I think the closest price car that can do this is a Mercedes E63 starting at 110K.

The complaints - this is through my prism as a performance car enthusiast. Speed nannies can stop reading here. The daily driving aspect of the car is almost perfect.

* The ZERO to 60 is fun. Anything from a 40 MPH roll is quite underwhelming, and from 60+, forget about it. Your moms Honda Accord Turbo will give it a run for your money. It sucks that the only solution here is a plaid power train or a 2 speed gearbox - both very expensive solutions.
* The seats. They need a competition seat as an option. Something with suede inserts and larger side bolsters. I slip around way too much in these things.
* Chrome exterior trim. I hate that I would have to spend around $800 to fix this. It's pretty common that ""sportier"" type trim levels of other vehicles have body colored molding. I'm glad to see they corrected this with the Model Y. 
* Lack of heads up display. I Feel that this is the most knit-picky complaint, and honestly I thought the complaints about having the move your eyes, not even your head, to see info on the screen was over-blown, but I get it now.

TeslaMotors,complaint,b11byh,A lot of the biggest objections to EVs from the past five years have evaporated,"A lot of the concerns I've read in recent years are more about all electric cars, but with Tesla being the only company selling significant volume in the US, the complaints tend to focus on Tesla.

**They charge too slow**... This seems to have been addressed in recent weeks. Even a few months ago I saw people arguing that a 30-40 wait time to get back to their road trips was a deal breaker. I think after 4-5 hours of driving, you really should take a break, but I understand that many people disagree, and with multiple drivers it's not an unreasonable concern. But now you can get several hours of range in 15-20 minutes.

**Not enough SuperChargers**... More are being built and there's a different sweet spot for everyone. Every week the number of buyers for whom this is no longer a concern drops. And with faster charging, the capacity per stall has increased dramatically.

**They're too expensive**... up until the SR Model 3 was released, this was true for most buyers, certainly for me. KBB says the [average new car cost in the US is over $35k](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/average-new-car-prices-jump-2-percent-for-march-2018-on-suv-sales-strength-according-to-kelley-blue-book-300623110.html) as of 2018. That means half of all car buyers are paying more than $35k already. In many cases they're buying SUVs or trucks, but this has still brought the cost within reach to a significant percentage of buyers. Still not me, buy my 2 year old used car was $38k new, so we're getting closer. The tax credit reduces it further, though that's going to end. The reduced per mile costs can also offset the cost of adding features.

**Batteries replacement is too expensive**... likely still true, but US News & World Report stated that after 150,000 miles, the Tesla batteries on average [only lose 8% of their range](https://cars.usnews.com/cars-trucks/why-people-dont-buy-electric-cars). Not many cars even last 150,000 miles. That's 92% capacity after 10-15 years of typical driving (the average is [13,576 per year](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ohim/onh00/bar8.htm).)

**Lack of service centers**... This is less important when mobile technicians will come to you to make repairs.

**Fire hazard**... this has been pretty widely debunked. The number of Tesla fires occuring for any reason other than catastrophic loss is exceptionally low, and overall is [""perhaps slightly less""](https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/17/news/companies/electric-car-fire-risk/index.html) than for an ICE vehicle.

**I want to buy a care TODAY**... It's true you can't go into a showroom and drive away in a new Tesla today. Lead times for orders has improved significantly, but they don't have excess inventory sitting around. The flip side to this is they don't require a high-pressure sales staff like traditional car companies do, which likely results in the exceptionally high customer satisfaction enjoyed by Model 3 owners, who are the most likely of all car buyers to buy another one today.

So that's it. That's my thinking. Most of the complaints have dissolved in the last few months or years.

TeslaMotors,complaint,188n03w,Highland after 2k km,"I LOVE my model 3. Build quality has massively improved since the launch wy back when. The suspension and interiour noic have greatly improved. Driving in the highway without music is very, very quiet. The doors and iverall build quality seems on a multituse better than the first model3s I got to ride in.

After 2k km I only have two complaints:

Indicators
I live in a country with loads of roundabouts. In those situations the blinkers are really inconvenient. First exit is usually no problems as you have to indicate anyways bevore entering the roundabout. Secon or if you exit straight is still okay as you have your steeringwheel still in an normal orientation when you indicate. Exiting at the 270 degree (usually third exit) is a nightmare. I am starting to get to used to it but you have your steering wheel upside down so you have to do some mental gymnastics to hit the right button. I have on multiple occansions hit the wrong one which kind of sucks. However I think I will get to used to it, but it takes time.

Teslavision
As it has been mentioned multiple times already teslavision is currently uselss. For parking it just draws lines wherever and beeps at me. Currently I think I would be better off if it was turned off completly and I could park normally without any ‚Äúhelp‚Äù of it at all.

Overall I am happy with my coice, LOVE the stealth Grey color (looks way better then the old grey).",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/188n03w/highland_after_2k_km/,yaenne,7868.0,0.9681
TeslaMotors,complaint,9q7lny,"Just finished my longest ever road trip (800+ miles) with the wife and two kids in my RWD Model 3, some observations...","1 - What you consider acceptable food during a supercharging stop will possibly differ from what your wife considers acceptable and will DEFINITELY differ from what your two kids will consider acceptable.  For each of our stops, I found myself dropping the family off at a restaurant and walking far (a solid mile the final stop) from the supercharger and back;

2 - I'm seriously considering a compact, foldable electric scooter to keep in the frunk for road trips (see #1 above)

3 - Pulling into a totally empty supercharger with 40 miles to go and having the first charger you try not work is a  pretty terrifying experience...

4 - While 2 short stops are more efficient from a charging standpoint, a sit down lunch makes one long stop a non-event;

5 - Telling your two sons that you'll split the money you saved by driving the Tesla instead of the ICE SUV magically eliminates the complaints about less room in the back seat (my 14 yo is 6' tall)

6 - It is an extremely pleasant surprise when your hotel has two level 2 chargers that are almost never used (according to the bellman), but there is going to be some SERIOUS growing pains when there are more of us vying for those few chargers;

7 - It's impossible to listen to 50's music without Slacker suggestion Paul Anka covers every third song;

8 - In the end, I made it from Richmond, VA to Greenville, SC and back (400 miles each way) with just one long stop in the middle and free charging overnight at the hotel.  I'm guessing that same trip would be much less efficient in the winter;

9 - I wish there was a climate mode that said ""Just blow some air on me without using any battery power to cool it or warm it, okay"" - I couldn't help but think I was using battery by running the heater or the A/C when I was actually okay with the temp but just needed some air circulation;

10 - There is going to be a very painful transition period in which all the superchargers are going to be jammed up almost all the time before Tesla can build out to accommodate.  The random empty charger I stopped at on the way down was showing TOTALLY full on the way back, so I stopped at a different charger that was slightly out of my way.

&#x200B;

EDIT #11 -- Don't know if this was holdover from the hurricane, but I was charged $0.00 for using the Superchargers in Burlington, NC and Greensboro, NC.  I'm willing to pay, Elon!

TeslaMotors,complaint,cbozjq,"Elon asked ""What's wrong with Slacker?""","In honor of the apparent acknowledgement that Tesla will finally be adding Spotify to U.S. Tesla's, I wanted to make a post about Slacker. Specifically, with regards to a comment Elon made in the fairly recent Ride the Lightning podcast. When asked about Spotify, Elon said ""What's wrong with Slacker?"" Here is my answer to that question, and I invite everyone out there to help answer it by adding below all your complaints about Slacker. I have 3.

----

I listen primarily to Deathcore and various subgenres of Death Metal. My experience with Slacker compared to Spotify is based entirely on this fact. 

  ‚Ä¢ Terrible catalogue - Spotify has every artist imaginable. Of my Spotify library I have 127 artists saved. Of that 127, 98 of them are some sub-genre of death metal. I painstakingly searched Slacker for every one of those artists. Slacker has exactly 12 of them. Elon, this makes Slacker almost entirely unusable for someone like me. I'd also like to add that Apple Music, Amazon Music, Pandora, and Google Play all offer the artists I listen to.

  ‚Ä¢ Horrible sub-genre recognition - This part may be hard to understand because this music is certainly not mainstream. But there is a massive difference between Deathcore and classic metal (like Pantera, etc). Of the 12 artists that Slacker has, I created a station from one of them. I am not joking, it started playing Nickelback, Papa Roach, Linkin Park and more. Even after weeks of 'curating' it, it still recommends those artists. For those of you who don't like Death Metal, this is basically the same as starting an Eminem station and it playing showtunes.

  ‚Ä¢ Curation system is flawed and plays the same 10 or so songs on repeat - I did an experiment and created a new station on Slacker. I wanted to see how long it would take before it started repeating music. The rules I followed were: upvote anything that's in the correct sub-genre, downvote anything that's very wrong, and skip anything that's close, but not the same sub-genre without upvote or downvote. This is what happened:
      - Create station, plays good song, upvote;
      - Next 3 songs are skipped due to sub-genre mismatch;
      - Next song plays, wrong genre, downvote;
      - 9 skips before next valid genre song, upvote;
      - Next song, very wrong genre, downvote;
      - Valid song, upvote (2 in a row! Wow!);
      - Next 2 songs, very wrong genre, downvote;
      - First upvoted song replays from earlier;
      - Next song, very wrong genre, downvote;
      - Next 3 songs are all upvoted songs from earlier;

Edit: sorry for bad formatting, can't get around it. TLDR: Slacker has no music I like, it can't recommend music correctly, and it repeats the same songs over and over again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/cbozjq/elon_asked_whats_wrong_with_slacker/,EatAHelicopter,4151.0,-0.869
TeslaMotors,complaint,auem3v,"4-months ownership review of my AWD Model 3, as a BMW M3 owner and car enthusiast.","Some background: I [took delivery](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9sm96f/got_my_second_m3/) of my AWD, non-Performance Model 3 with AP as a daily driver around 4 months ago. In the past 4 months I've put on more than 4000 miles in the car, taken it on to some short road trips, ""abused"" it in the automotive hell that is known as Bay Area daily traffic, and drove it around some of the best driving roads in the country.

I currently also own a F80 BMW M3 as a weekend car (may get replaced by the new Supra, we'll see...), and I've driven pretty much all major players in the compact premium sports sedan segment, including the brand new [2019 G20 3-series](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/au2jaj/i_just_drove_the_new_3_series_and_it_was_honestly/). So I'll be basing my thoughts and reviews on a lot of comparisons to the Model 3's peers.

That being said, most of what I'm about to write are *subjective* personal opinions, even though I try to base them on as much real experiences and facts as possible.

I'll be giving each category a subjective score as well. They are scored against other cars *in the same segment*, just so it remains relevant and fair.

**Build quality (9/10)**: My car was actually delivered without much problem and everything seemed well put together. No visible panel gap issues and interior didn't have any noticeable rattling/squeaking. I got ceramic coating on my car and the guy mentioned it was the first Model 3 he saw that did not require paint correction. However one of the two horn buttons on my steering wheel came dead on arrival, which was scary the first time I needed to use it.

**Drivetrain (9/10)**: The main reason I got the Model 3. Tesla's EV drivetrain is the best in the industry at the moment and it's every bit as good as I hoped. Despite the AWD Model 3 feels ""nerfed"" in the 0-30 range, it's still instantly responsive the low end torque delivery beats even the best turbochargers out there. Its performance does feel diminished after 60mph but that's expected. In day to day driving it's quicker than pretty much every competitor in the segment. However the new 2019 M340i is a direct competitor to the AWD Model 3 and does 0-60 in 4.1s, so I'm hoping Tesla does a bit of that magical ""uncorking"" sometimes soon :)

**Steering/Handling/Chassis (8/10)**: Very good steering, nicely weighted and accurate and absurdly quick, if not overly so steering ratio (quicker than even the Alfa Giulia). Steering feeling is numb though, which is a shame. The handling is helped a lot by the rigid body (thanks to the battery pack) and low center of gravity (again, thanks to the battery pack), but the standard Continental all season tires that come with this car are just an absolute embarrassment. They provide borderline pitiful traction for a car this heavy and I highly recommend people looking into new tires as the first upgrade to handling. Personally I would rank my Model 3 as the 3rd best handling car in the segment, behind the surgically precise 2019 3 series and the Italian ballerina that is the Alfa Romeo Giulia.

**Exterior (7/10)**: It has grown on me, but doesn't exactly make me look back at the car after I park it (ok sometimes I do that to make sure it locked itself). If I got a P3D this would have been a 5/10 score, but in this particular segment it looks just sleek enough, if not a bit run of the mill. Front of the car looks a lot better than the rear, and the side profile is also not bad. I have not had any one compliments me on the car since I got it, which is something that happens at least a couple times a month in my M3. I personally think the Model S remains the best looking Tesla on the market right now.

**Interior Quality/Comfort (6/10)**: First of all I just want to say the interior material is pretty decent, better than the outgoing 3 series and most of the Japanese cars in this segment. I personally prefer the vegan leather to most of the base real leather from competitors. For example the vegan leather in my Model 3 feels and looks much, much better than the Dakota leather in the 3 series. It's not on the same level as the full Merino leather in my M3, but again, that's not even an option for the regular 3 series. Shout out to KIA/Hyundai here though, as the Stinger and G70 both have an interior that punches way above their weight.

One major complaint I have, other than Elon's apparent obsession with piano black plastics, is the lack of cabin insulation. The tire and wind noise in this car is significant at highway speed and is noticeably lacking when compared to the class leaders. It's not a deal breaker but I was honestly shocked at how loud my Model 3 was after test driving the new 3-series.

**Cabin features/technology (2/10)**: First of all the uncharacteristically cold west coast winter made me realize how much I love having heated steering wheel. Not even having that as an option in a $60k+ car is pretty rare these days. Another noticeably missing feature for a new car is vented seats, but I haven't been missing it since you know...winter, and my BMW strangely didn't offer it either.

Unfortunately, cabin technology in this car is poor. The actual touchscreen hardware is great, with very high resolution (although worse pixel density when compared to the new iDrive 7 systems) and very responsive. But actual features and functions are not as accessible when driving. There is no meaningful phone integration, no Spotify support, and the music player is the worst I've seen in years. It has no playlist control, and no *reliable* [album art support](https://i.imgur.com/YqoQ1FV.jpg) over Bluetooth. CarPlay and Android Auto would have addressed a lot of the infotainment issues but Tesla remains one of the last automakers that's not supporting them.

No, I'm not some geezer who hates touchscreens. In fact I built my entire relatively successful career on shipping touchscreen applications with beautiful UX and HMI is one area where I will not hesitate in debating against even engineers/designers from Tesla itself. I think Tesla sacrificed a bit too much on usability/accessibility for low learning curve, if not for cost saving. For whatever it's worth, the best touchscreen based car interior I've seen is still the Model S, as it has a right blend of physical buttons and touchscreen functionalities. The new BMW iDrive 7 is the best hybrid system on the market right now, with a much steeper learning curve but better accessibility and operational efficiency once you learn it. 

Additionally, The car is also lacking some major features that's common in competitors these days, such as a top down parking camera and a HUD. My Model 3 really needs a HUD, and it would address 90% of the problems I have with the interface. [Photos don't do it justice](https://imgur.com/a/iPHg3aD) when it comes to how amazing the newest generation systems are. Did I get used to looking to the right for speed/navigation/AP info? Yes. Does that make it superior to the alternative? Hell no. 

**Auto Pilot (10/10)**: As far as I can tell still the best such system out there. Competitors are [catching up quickly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qESOThKGIMI) but Tesla still leads the pack. Over the air update should maintain that edge for the foreseeable future. It's not perfect, and Navigation on Auto Pilot...scares me.

**Ownership experience (8/10)**: Not having to go to the gas station, ever, is fantastic. Free charging at a bunch of places including work is also amazing. Two points deducted for feeling the inconvenience of EVs when I took it on some road trips. In one case the destination charger at the hotel I was staying at got ICEd so I had to plan detours the second day. Winter driving was also not great for range, but that was somewhat expected. 

**Summary:** Great car, given my personal need I think I would have bought it again. It's not perfect by any means but again, no car is. If you ask me for advice for shopping in this segment I would have put it up there as one of the top 2 recommendations, along with the new 3 series, if the EV lifestyle works for you.

TeslaMotors,complaint,7b53be,"If Tesla is 3 months behind in Model3 production, why has my delivery estimate only moved 1 month?","I am a non-owner on the East coast. I waited in line at my local store for them to unlock the doors and made my reservation at approx 10.30am on 3/31. My Tesla account says my reservation was made on 3/31 (despite some line waiters who've seen their status go from 3/31 to 4/1). Up until the earnings call where they announced their most recent delay, my delivery estimate for First Production was Nov'17 - Jan'18.

Now, the revised estimate is Dec'17 - Feb'18. So I'm wondering how that is. Certainly no complaints, but just wondering why it's only 1 month later. Does it indicate that possibly there aren't too many current owners in my region who have reservations, thus once they start public deliveries to my region, there aren't too many people ahead of me?",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7b53be/if_tesla_is_3_months_behind_in_model3_production/,TheNewJasonBourne,269255.0,0.138
TeslaMotors,complaint,nohajm,Vision only likely isn't as bad as you think,"Hi all,

To start, I'll say that I don't drive a vision-only car but I have owned my Model 3 with FSD for nearing 2 years now and have seen how it's changed over time and have a good understanding of its limitations at the moment.

I just wanted to give my thoughts on a lot of the vision-only discussions I see going around the past few days:

&#x200B;

**'Auto high beam is required now! This is terrible!'**

I feel like this is a bit of a misconception, remember that vision is required for you to drive even if you have radar. Vision is used to determine drivable space, obstacles, lane lines, etc. - You can't drive purely on radar. This change is something I'm surprised wasn't in the car when I picked it up nearing 2 years ago, I mean... If you require vision, why wouldn't you allow the car to automate the high beams?

However... Tesla's auto high beam is pretty wacky and unpolished, they either need to allow manually disabling it or simply put a lot of time and effort into making auto high beam work as intended. When they put their heart into something it usually improves pretty fast like 'Auto wipers V3' has in the same version.

**'It slows down in rain! This is terrible!'**

Ask yourself this: Why does the car on vision+radar not slow down in the rain when vision is required? Anyone who's driving with Autopilot in heavy rain will have had this experience:

There's lots of spray on the road, Autopilot is flying along at 75mph like a crazy person, it drives straight into spray at that speed and is blinded by it, so it panics, slams on the brakes, then disengages.

Controlling the speed better in rain is essential for safety and we've seen many crashes from people on Autopilot hydroplaning by driving too fast for the weather conditions without Autopilot having a care in the world.

However... Tesla is clearly being very cautious with its current settings, I imagine in a few updates we'll see them increase the speeds Autopilot will travel in certain weather conditions as they confirm it's not an issue. It's all about getting that data.

**'It can't see the car ahead of the one I'm following and requires the '3' follow setting! This is terrible!'**

If you're following a large vehicle that you can't see over, do you crash into them? Most likely not. (Unless you're in the US where everyone drives bumper to bumper and gets in giant 30 car pile-ups as a result)

The '3' setting is a safe follow distance, I'm surprised they ever let you set it to 1 as this is just tailgating.

Remember: The follow distance isn't 'car lengths', maybe it's seconds or something? Either way, it adjusts based on speed. Even if you set it to 6 you'll be only 1 car length behind people up to 10 or 15mph before it starts to gain distance, this makes it perfectly fine in traffic, you're not going to get cut off by this. You're more likely to be cut off by the car 'yo-yoing' as it's sometimes slow to set off from a standstil.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I honestly don't think the vision update is as bad as people are making it out to be. There's a bunch of videos going around showing what it's capable of and vehicle detection is equally as smooth as radar, maybe smoother in some cases as it seems the visuals are updated more often. (Maybe vision has a higher update rate? Who knows)

Sure, there's a lot of wacky stuff in this update, but a lot of major complaints are features that would have been implemented for radar users anyway, they're not specifically an issue caused by removing radar; I suppose that's the point I'm trying to make here.

I just think it's smart to wait until Tesla is off the 'day 1 release' update and has had some time to flesh out things based on feedback before everyone jumps on the 'It's horrible! We're all going to die! It's the end of Tesla!' bandwagon. :)

&#x200B;

**Edit to clarify some things**

Here's some good images to show what the new full-vision approach is capable of detecting, as someone with a radar-vision car I honeslty think this is pretty impressive, it's detcting a lot of vehicles and they look to be in the right place not 'wobbling around', some are even being detected behind the user's car which is something the current production release doesn't do as the rear camera isn't used:

Check out how far the detection is seeing on this image:

(So far that it goes further than the draw distance on the display)

Or the amount of cars on this one:

Or the ability to determine how far the truck is in front of the pickup here, this would be extremely hard for a human in that situation as we're pretty bad at straight-line depth:

TeslaMotors,complaint,c2wd0h,"There aren't a lot of Model 3 reviews from ""traditional"" car enthusiasts, so I wrote my own","While I know the Model 3 has been out for 2 years now, it seems a lot of reviews are from Tesla fans and not so much ‚Äútraditional‚Äù car enthusiasts, so I thought I‚Äôd write a review voicing my opinions. That, plus I want my thoughts recorded for my own posterity.

For some time now, I‚Äôve been considering purchasing a Tesla Model 3. I‚Äôm generally a more frugal car enthusiast, and spending $39.9k on any other car would be nuts to me, but the Tesla at least on paper offers a lot to like: there‚Äôs of course the instant acceleration at any speed, but there‚Äôs also the super low CoG, lack of distractions in the cabin (so you can focus on driving!), no warm-up and cool-down procedures, OTA updates that occasionally bring performance and range increases, and no guilt associated with lots of unnecessary driving, which I personally do value. I was also very tempted by Autopilot, since there are times I just don‚Äôt care to drive and would be perfectly happy to let the car do the work.

So, to assuage my curiosity, I rented a long-range RWD model for two days from Turo. I spent a couple minutes adjusting settings, drove off, and‚Ä¶ instantly hated it. Right off the bat:

* I could not for the life of me get the seat into a comfortable position. The seat bottom was bolstered too much and cut into my thigh, the pressure on my back was awful no matter where I put the lumbar support, and the headrest intrudes forwards and *doesn‚Äôt adjust at all* so when sitting upright, your head actually touches the seat before your shoulders do. Try to put your shoulders against the seat too, and you end up sitting like a hunchback. I absolutely *hated* this, and despite frequently adjusting the seat throughout the two days, I couldn‚Äôt make it any better.

* The driver‚Äôs mirror doesn‚Äôt adjust far enough out. I like to follow the recommended method for [eliminating blind spots]( https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a15131074/how-to-adjust-your-mirrors-to-avoid-blind-spots/) but couldn‚Äôt move the mirror far enough to do so.

* The turn signal is BMW-style in that it doesn‚Äôt stay where you put it, but rather springs up after you press it so it‚Äôs impossible to tell what it‚Äôs doing by feel alone. Even BMW is reverting on this because it‚Äôs so awful. That said, I did eventually get used to it.

* The car was dog slow. Punch it, and it accelerated at a Civic pace. I‚Äôve driven Teslas before, so I knew that wasn‚Äôt right. I eventually found out the car was in Chill Mode, and I fixed it. BUT, my time spent driving it in Chill Mode made me realize just how much of the enjoyment of this car is dependent on acceleration. Take away the acceleration, and you may as well be driving a slightly quieter Civic.

But after getting to drive the car some more, I found there were definitely a number of things I liked:

* Acceleration at most speeds was solid. While this was no P100D, it definitely has good low-end torque, and of course acceleration is uninterrupted by gear changes. I found it started to run out of steam after 60 or so, and there wasn‚Äôt much of anything left after 80. Still, great for darting around traffic.

* The traction control is the best I‚Äôve ever encountered. While I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs possible to turn it off, I don‚Äôt really care: while you can feel it working, it‚Äôs very unobtrusive, and its purpose is more to help put the power down in low-traction situations than to limit power. A huge change from the TC in my Mazdaspeed3, which just cuts engine power at the first sign of wheelspin.

* I like the interior overall. The lack of buttons encourages you to focus more on driving (though it does forego something I‚Äôll discuss towards the end), and the touch screen is very responsive with a mostly-intuitive layout. Materials were nice, but nothing special. The dash is soft touch, though it actually looks like hard plastic. The piano-black plastic trim in the center was unsurprisingly already scratched despite the car only having 10k miles, and the 12v outlet was in a place that left me scratching my head, but I enjoyed the clean minimalism overall. I do think wiper and headlight controls should *not* be in the touchscreen, since they‚Äôre safety-related. 

* Steering had a nice weight to it: in sport mode, it was actually heavier than my MS3, whose weight I already felt was quite good. I did not ever take it out of sport mode.

* I could leave the AC on, and not worry about it robbing power from the engine. In my MS3 (and virtually every other gas car) I try not to use AC for this reason alone, but in the Tesla, no problem.

* Autopilot in heavy traffic was heavenly. Move to the center lane, engage AP, and let the car do the work. I don‚Äôt drive much in heavy traffic, but if I did, it would be difficult to *not* get this car based on that alone. I found it was unfazed by rain too, which was a nice bonus.

* The driving definitely was guilt-free, as I‚Äôd hoped. I did a number of unnecessary trips, and was excited to do so. Didn‚Äôt need to give the car any time to warm up or cool down, and while of course I used more battery punching it, I had no qualms doing so because a) pollution externalities are minimal, b) cost was minimal, and c) I knew I‚Äôd have a ‚Äúfull tank‚Äù again the next morning, thus the extra ‚Äúfuel‚Äù used hardly mattered. Except‚Ä¶

* ‚Ä¶I was planning to charge in my garage using my dryer outlet. Turns out I had the wrong type of outlet, so I charged the first night on 120v, but only gained ~45 miles of range over ~10 hours. So the next day I used a supercharger. Supercharging was great though: spent only about 40 mins there, went from 64 miles to ~250, and it cost $10.80. So about a third what it would cost to gas up my premium-fuel MS3.

But unfortunately, while I *really liked* those positives, there were also a lot of things I really hated:

* The aforementioned seat comfort. That alone would be a reason for me to not get the car. It was *really* bad. That‚Äôs why you try before you buy!
 
* Missing features. The two biggest for me were Carplay and ventilated seats. I spoke to a guy at the supercharger who said he just uses ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù as a substitute. Yeah, that‚Äôs not really a substitute. He also seemed unaware ventilated seats were a thing now. 

* The center screen rebooted on me twice while driving. No idea why; the owner swears she‚Äôs never had that happen. To its credit, it didn‚Äôt affect drivability, even with AP running the second time, and it resumed navigation when it started back up. 

* The glass roof. You can‚Äôt even really see/enjoy it while driving, but you can certainly *feel* it. I‚Äôm in Texas; while it only got up to 89 degrees, that afternoon sun beating down on my head was unbearably bad, despite the tint. I can‚Äôt imagine how it would be on a 110 degree day. And no, there‚Äôs no cover for it, so you get the full force of the sun on your head no matter what. And of course no ventilated seats, so my back got quite sweaty. I cranked the AC more than I usually would, but all that meant was my hands were freezing while my head and back were hot and sweaty. I was not a fan (heh). Fortunately there are third party sunshades available, but it seems ridiculous to me that customers of a $40k car should need to provide their own non-integrated solution.

* As I said, AP was great in heavy traffic. It was usually okay in free-flowing traffic. But when it wasn‚Äôt okay, it *really* wasn‚Äôt okay. Phantom braking, giving up on sweeping curves mid-curve (and reverting to going straight, forcing me to wrestle control), sometimes seeing stopped cars and other times plowing towards them, giving up on perfectly safe lane changes mid-change, waiting 5 full seconds before even beginning a lane change, braking to merge in behind someone when there‚Äôs plenty of space up ahead, waiting a while to accelerate again after someone made a right turn in front of me (and then accelerating at a snail‚Äôs pace), and so on. In anything besides super-heavy and completely free-flowing traffic, it was often more trouble to use than it was worth. I found myself yelling at the car and wrestling control (sometimes out of desire, sometimes out of necessity) quite often.  
All that said, I‚Äôd rather have *some* AP than not have it at all, so I can‚Äôt complain too much.

* I‚Äôm a big fan of basic cruise control, but the only cruise this car offers is traffic-aware, which means if you want to just cruise there‚Äôs no way to avoid the phantom braking and freakouts when people merge in 200 ft ahead. You also can‚Äôt approach a car from behind and manually pass it, because it will have started braking long before you‚Äôre anywhere near close enough to require passing. It‚Äôs almost as though the car would prefer you to just sit in the free-flowing passing lane, which is obviously not okay.

* One-pedal driving took some getting used to, but I did. But while I like the concept, I‚Äôm putting this in the negatives section because execution could be way better. The Chevy Bolt has a paddle you can pull to enable regen, which I much prefer as it allows you much finer control while also allowing you to rest your foot and just coast as you would in a gas car. Also, regen alone won‚Äôt bring you to a full stop, whereas in other EVs it will. 

* You definitely feel the weight of this car. I took it on some scenic roads, and while I never really drove beyond 5/10ths, you could still feel the car‚Äôs desire to plow ahead when pushed‚Ä¶ but at the same time, the low CoG and good TC kept it reasonably planted. It was kind of a weird combination of sensations, and I suspect the overinflated (45 PSI) tires didn‚Äôt help.

* While steering weight was good, steering feedback was fairly poor. It wasn‚Äôt full-on disconnected, but it wasn‚Äôt very communicative either.

* This is not a practical car cargo-wise. I went shopping and bought four stacking chairs. They‚Äôd fit in my MS3 no problem; in this, I really had to finagle them to fit into the rear seat area. This alone is why I was honestly more intrigued by the Model Y, what with it having a hatch instead of a trunk, but since the base model won‚Äôt be out for another 2 years, I thought I might just put up with the limitations of a Model 3 until then. Eh.

But all of these pale in comparison to the two biggest drawbacks I found:

* ‚ÄúTesla people.‚Äù I don‚Äôt want to paint with a big brush, as I‚Äôd still consider myself one; but there tend to be two types of people drawn to Teslas: a) car people who like the car for its performance and abilities, because despite my complaints above it‚Äôs a solid daily overall; and b) ‚ÄúTesla people‚Äù who came from Camrys and Priuses and have never experienced any other car in the $40k+ range (or even another performance car in general) and thus think Teslas are the greatest cars in the world. They‚Äôre people who post [memes like this.]( https://i.redd.it/7bkhyjhetbw21.jpg) They‚Äôre people who would never even consider any car that isn‚Äôt a Tesla, and as a result don‚Äôt know or even care what other cars have to offer. The guy at the supercharger who didn‚Äôt know ventilated seats were a thing is a ‚ÄúTesla person.‚Äù Same with the owner of the car, who admitted she didn‚Äôt care about cars until she bought her Tesla. While obviously this is not a fault of the car, it annoys me because if half the potential market is okay with locking into a single brand of car forever, it discourages other EV competition that‚Äôs sorely needed. Plus the smug factor *can* be annoying, depending on how it‚Äôs presented.

* Nothing about this car really evokes emotion. Some may find it odd that I even care, but this is actually the #1 thing I care about when test driving a potential new car. I want to feel emotionally connected to the car, between driving it, staring at it, or even just daydreaming about it.  
So why couldn‚Äôt I connect with the Tesla? I think the biggest part of it is the lack of analog experience. As humans, we are intuitively attuned to analog, physical, even visceral experiences, *even when those experiences are imperfect.* It‚Äôs why playing with your dog, or having sex with a human you love, are so much more satisfying that interacting with a perfectly obedient dog on a screen or watching a perfect 10 in a porno. In many cars, you get this experience in a number of ways: Exhaust note. Turbo spool. Craftsmanship. Manual transmission. Oversteer. Road feedback. Engine rumble. And in the Tesla, with its relative lack of driver engagement, you just don‚Äôt get that same experience. In fact, a good chunk of Tesla‚Äôs MO is about actively *hiding* that experience, what with the focus on self-driving and even a lack of physical buttons. I get that a lot of people *want* this, for the same reasons most people would prefer an Apple Watch to a Patek, and that‚Äôs fine, but it‚Äôs not what I want as an enthusiast.  
The other reason I couldn‚Äôt connect is it‚Äôs not a very ‚Äúspecial‚Äù car. There‚Äôs no story behind it. ‚ÄúWe needed a mass-market electric car, so we built one‚Äù is a good reason for the car to exist, but it‚Äôs not a *story.* Sometimes a story will come with time: many people look back on their first cars with rose-tinted glasses not because of the cars themselves, but because of the memories made in those cars. But other stories already occurred, or are still unfolding, and when you buy the car now, you‚Äôre buying into that story. It‚Äôs part of the reason BMWs with racing pedigree are so popular. It‚Äôs why people shopping at Whole Foods pay extra to read a blurb about the farmer who provided their locally-sourced organic free-range ethically-killed gluten-free vegan broccoli whereas the shopper at Walmart only buys based on price. In actuality, the two broccolis likely aren‚Äôt all that different from each other, but the Whole Foods one is ‚Äúspecial,‚Äù and that matters on an emotional level. The Model 3 is not a special car.

**Final thoughts:** I think what I‚Äôd like most of all is for another manufacturer to produce a real, actual, viable competitor to the Model 3. Looking at everything available now and even in the next two years, I‚Äôm just not seeing anything. $39.9k gets you a Model 3 with 240 miles of range, acceleration close to that of my MS3, OTA updates, and AP, for better or worse. Every other EV right now is either slower, lower range, more expensive, lacks any sort of AP, lacks OTA, or even several of the above. And the EVs coming out don‚Äôt appear to fare much better: the ones most discussed are more competitive with the Model S (which debuted in 2012!) than the 3, and even there they often fall short at least on paper. And none of them have Tesla‚Äôs two biggest not-so-secret weapons: superchargers and gigafactories. While public chargers exist, superchargers are still a huge advantage due to a) public perception and b) the fact that most public chargers suck. Often they are too expensive, there are too few, they‚Äôre too slow, they‚Äôre full, they‚Äôre blocked, or they‚Äôre broken. Car manufacturers understandably want to just produce the cars and leave the infrastructure up to others, but that‚Äôs a tough sell. Even if you charge at home 99% of the time, the lack of reliable public infrastructure really hurts adoption. I know I personally would not consider a Bolt (the most viable currently-available non-Tesla EV) in part because of it. And of course, the gigafactories are a huge advantage due to the cost savings enabled by vertical integration. I don‚Äôt see Tesla losing either of these advantages any time soon, and other manufacturers will struggle to compete as a result. But I really hope they do, as we really need competition to eliminate the long list of negatives above.

**Conclusion:** I rented this Tesla Model 3 for the purposes of determining, once and for all, whether I want to order one or not. And now, I can honestly say‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm more conflicted than ever. Despite the huge list of glaring negatives above, this car is a fine daily driver. And daily driving is most of what I do‚ÄîI have to actually travel a bit to get to twisties, so I don‚Äôt go frequently, and while I‚Äôd like to go to a track *someday*, I wouldn‚Äôt want to beat my daily up on it anyways. So by that metric, AP + a bit of low-end power should be key to making the best daily in the world, right? And yet, I just can‚Äôt see this being my only car. I suspect I would miss 80% of what I love about cars, and be hot and uncomfortable the rest of the time. But a pillow + aftermarket sunshade + a [headrest mod]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vIBNx0rBQ) can fix all that, right? And I‚Äôd probably *come* to love the car eventually as I write my own story, surely?? Truth is, I have no idea, and have learned nothing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/c2wd0h/there_arent_a_lot_of_model_3_reviews_from/,hutacars,264843.0,0.9997
TeslaMotors,complaint,b94zji,The Model 3 Sound System in the Premium Interior is a Homerun!,"I‚Äôll try to keep this short and sweet. 

As someone who has experience with audio and music production, I must say, the sound I‚Äôm getting from this system is impressive.  The lows are sharp and not muddy, the mids are well balanced and the highs cut through wonderfully.  

Granted I‚Äôve EQ‚Äôd it just a little bit but overall, I have no complaints.

TeslaMotors,complaint,f0rl05,Rant about Tesla‚Äôs infotainment & software priorities,"This is not about AP or FSD.

For reference, I drive a 2020 3LRD, but I‚Äôm sure this is relevant to S & X as well.

Some of the things I mention here are nit-picky, but some are legitimate ‚ÄúI paid enough for this car that this should be sorted‚Äù issues.

Start rant;

Does anyone else not give a hoot about having video games in their car? I‚Äôve literally played 
backgammon twice, and haven‚Äôt even opened any of the other games. And why add all these video 
streaming services when they haven‚Äôt even gotten the music streaming services right yet?

My frustration is that Tesla are putting too much emphasis on party-trick functions that I can't use while driving (even if FSD one day works, it‚Äôs at least a few years before we‚Äôll be able to watch TV or game while driving), instead of fixing/improving real features that I CAN use while driving. I have no problem with the party-tricks, but fix the real functions first. Owners are reporting all sorts of issues/complaints that seem to be getting ignored. A few examples off the top of my head;

- Spotify badly needs updating; sorting, 320kbps (for Spotify premium subscribers), podcasts, 
gapless playback / caching. Why pay for Tesla premium + Spotify premium only to lose 
features and quality? I can stream 4K YouTube, but not 320kbps music? WTF!? (in before 
you say to use Bluetooth from my phone. I am, but I shouldn‚Äôt have to)

- Auto-Wipers need a sensitivity setting NOT a neural net. Honestly, they work, but the
problem is that they‚Äôre currently not ‚Äúone-size fits all‚Äù. People have different preferences on 
how they want their wipers to work, and a neural net won‚Äôt change that. For me, I find the 
auto-wipers far too aggressive. They go full speed when I only want intermittent. Just give us a user adjustable sensitivity setting. The solution is so simple!

- Auto-dimming mirrors; Again, we need a sensitivity setting or a manual control.

- Climate control; I‚Äôve given up on auto-climate. It‚Äôs ok in mild weather, but doesn‚Äôt cope with 
the random weather where I live. It never cools my feet on a really hot day, and blows hot 
air in my face when it‚Äôs cold. Swap the F/R demisters and seat heaters off of the main screen and put the climate controls there instead. Or at the very least put manual fan speed on the 
main screen!

- Better yet, make the quick access bar at the bottom of the screen customizable. I‚Äôm not the 
first to suggest this. This will keep everyone happy.

- Even on manual mode the A/C temperature fluctuates. In this mode the temperature setting 
should control the vent temperature, but it seems to be going off the overall cabin temperature. So if the cabin temp is 23C and you set the A/C to 21C, it makes the air colder 
than 21C.

- Auto-high beams are an absolute joke. I can‚Äôt even.

I know there are lots of other features/fixes that people want too, but I can‚Äôt cover everything here. It sucks that only requests from famous tweeters get any traction, and I‚Äôm sure most of the things I've mentioned are relatively easy to change.

I just want Tesla to prioritise the useful stuff. 

Rant over.

Edit: a lot of good discussion here, which I appreciate. I think a lot of you missed my point, which is about Tesla‚Äôs priorities in this area, not necessarily the specific examples that I listed. My bad I guess for writing too much on them. And thanks to those that included tesla feedback email addresses.

TeslaMotors,complaint,7qir8p,Impressions after renting Model 3 for a day,"A couple days ago, I saw a Model 3 listed on Turo so I thought I‚Äôd treat myself to the long weekend with a rental (total was ~$250). After picking up the car this morning, I drove around the SF Bay Area‚ÄîSkyline Blvd, 101, 280 and Sausalito‚Äîand clocked in about 200 miles. I‚Äôm writing down a few of my impressions so that I can keep this experience alive in my memory until I take delivery in March (fingers and toes crossed):

* Electric motor is amazing. I love the instant response and the lack of vibrations, noise and smoke. It‚Äôs very peaceful to have a car that doesn‚Äôt vibrate at rest or on the move. No shudder of the engine when you turn the key, no loud grunts when you step on the pedal, no smell of smoke in the garage. Silence is a luxury and I‚Äôll gladly pay for it. 
* Driving the Model 3 feels effortless. The car listens to your input instantly and obediently. I also like how regenerative braking helps you control the speed with one pedal. Because I can slow down without my brake, I can control the speed more smoothly and easily. This was the most pleasant surprise from driving an electric car for the first time.
* The car is plenty powerful at 0mph, but I think Tesla tuned the software so that the car gets its maximum acceleration around 30mph-70mph. It feels like warp speed, like when you‚Äôre going really fast in Burnout Paradise. The faint whirl of the motor made it sound like a spaceship.
* Speaking of spaceship, I love the interior. Other manufactures can replicate the electric performance, but they can‚Äôt copy the Model 3‚Äôs minimalist interior. It‚Äôs the cleanest design I‚Äôve ever seen in a car. One long vent to modulate the temperature. One big screen to contain all the information. Symmetry of the steering column within the larger symmetry of the dash.
* The center piece of the interior is the display. And when I say display, I mean the user interface. As someone who spends a lot of time on his iPhone, I feel at home. The design team did a great job organizing the screen and designing beautiful UI (especially on the left side of the screen). You can just tell they are made by ex-Apple designers/engineers.
* Of course, there are still a lot of things that could be better on the UI. I can‚Äôt wait for future iterations of the software. This is what I really love about tech.
* In an ideal world, all the driving information should be about the same focal distance away as what you‚Äôre seeing on the road. However, I‚Äôm not sure how they could achieve that without compromising the interior that I like so much. HUD would leave a big gaping hole in the dash, and screen in front of the wheel would require a big cowl to maintain contrast against the sun. Design is all about working within the constraints, and I think they struck the right balance. That said, different people care about different things and I can totally understand how they might find some of the compromises unacceptable.
* I‚Äôm curious to see how Tesla is going to one-up Model 3 with refreshed S/X (and possibly address those compromises).
* Autopilot: On straight roads and wide curves, they work like a charm. They help you take your mind off the physical act of keeping your car in the lane so you can focus more on ‚Äúmeta-level‚Äù details like keeping an eye on the cars changing lanes, double-checking which exit to take, etc. I think it‚Äôs about 80% there, but we always know that the last 20 is the hardest. Anticipating curves, taking sharp turns, other cars merging in, exit lanes, stoplights, blindspots, etc. It turns out the last 20% takes an inordinate amount of effort, like supercharging a battery that‚Äôs almost full.
* Autopilot is still a few major iterations away from 100% and even more for FSD, but it‚Äôs already very useful. I can‚Äôt wait for future updates.
* It‚Äôs kind of cute how Autopilot UI thinks all the other cars on the road are Tesla.
* Alcantara: This car was an early VIN so it had the Alcantara headliners. The swirls in the texture tease my OCD, but it feels nice to touch (I normally don‚Äôt get this intimate with cars, let alone its headliner).
* My biggest complaint is the lack of heated steering wheel. It almost makes me want to wait extra few months (or years?) so that I can get it. Heated steering wheel is just soooooooo nice. Ugh!
* Also, how nice would it be if you could watch Netflix on the screen while supercharging.
* Rear visibility is not great. If the car behind you is less than 0.5 vehicle-length away at night, it‚Äôs almost impossible to tell. The rental also was tinted so it was doubly difficult. I wonder if the UI could show the car behind you like it does with cars in front.
* Headlights are super bright. You could easily tell the difference if you drove next to it on a highway. This is a great safety feature.
* Sound quality is awesome. The best speakers I have are Sonos One and they are comparable.
* I didn‚Äôt get to test out the phone key because this was a rental. The valets are definitely going to struggle with the card.
* For those of us that are waiting for our turn:

TeslaMotors,complaint,4dsudi,I think my Model 3 might end up costing $70K,"Some quick calculations:

* Base price, $35,000
* Supercharging enabled, $1,000 *old 60 KWh price (s/w only)*
* Dual-motor AWD, $4,000 *""less than $5,000""*
* Autopilot enabled, $2,500 *Model S price*
* Smart air suspension, $2,500 *Model S price*
* Sub-zero weather package, $1,000 *Model S price*
* Panoramic roof, $1,500 *Model S price*
* Leather interior, $2,500 *Model S price*
* Premium interior & lighting, $3,000 *Model S price*
* Ultra high-fidelity sound, $2,500 *Model S price*
* Battery upgrade, $13,900 *cost of 70 > 90D minus $5,000 for AWD*
* Upgraded paint, $1,000 *Model S price*

Total: $70,400

Yes, yes, I know the limitations of my method. Options probably won't cost exactly what they do on the Model S. Tesla is pushing down battery prices with the Gigafactory. Not all Model S options will be available on the Model 3. But as a sanity check, a tricked-out BMW 3-series costs more than a base-level 5-series, so this makes sense.

By the way, this isn't a complaint. If I don't want to pay for all these options, I don't have to. I trust that Tesla is going to deliver on their $35,000 promise. But I'd like a nicely appointed car, and so I'm willing to pay.

EDIT: Added upgraded paint for $1,000.

EDIT 2: Reduced cost of Supercharger option to $1,000.

EDIT 3: After observing the discussion, it's clear that that the wild card is the battery. As shown above, it represents about 39% of my total upgrade cost. The promise of the Gigafactory is to bring down battery prices. By how much, I don't know. I'm hopeful that a battery upgrade to get the Model 3 from 215 to 270+ miles of range won't actually cost $13,900. However, I based the list above on published data wherever I could, and we have published data for a Tesla battery upgrade, so I used that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/4dsudi/i_think_my_model_3_might_end_up_costing_70k/,synchronicityii,35498.0,0.9718

TeslaMotors,complaint,aldv9m,Tesla in the Vortex: my experiences with my Model 3 in extreme cold and snow,"Short of it: I live in Toronto. We were hit with extreme temperatures this past week. On Monday night, we got bombarded by snow, to the tune of probably one to two feet. Then today, our temperatures dropped to -28C (-18F for my fellow yankees out there). 

I've had a Model 3 RWD since September, so this is my first winter with the car. I keep it outdoors at all times - I park it in the driveway between my house and my neighbour's, and I use the portable charger that came with the car to keep it juiced up overnight.

I have to report that, to this point, the car has handled the adverse weather conditions just fine. Here's a brief breakdown on some specifics:

**Range**

I can't say that I've been paying much attention to efficiency during this weather. I typically keep the car charged overnight and start my day with 440km of range. However, I did not plug the car in last night, and between driving (5KM to work and back, and a few other places local to home that probably put my total driving range to around 30KM since the last charge) and my battery has dropped from 440km to around 280. I don't really consider this concerning, nor is it representing the actual range of the car were I to climb in and simply drive it to the States or somewhere. I suspect that if I got it on the highway, the Actual Range would be similar to the trip I took to NY at Christmas time - about 350km (220-230 miles) for a full charge. I wouldn't be shocked it it was closer to 200 miles, but it would still be efficient enough that I wouldn't stress.

**Handling**

I fortunately have winter tires. I say fortunate, as my street has basically transformed into a one lane slush street. There have been times when I've had to drive the car into a foot or so of slushy snow, and I have been frequently impressed by the car's ability to push through it. The only time I found myself at all stuck was driving uphill on a *very* snowy street, when I had to drive off the ""track"" to allow another car to pass. It took a bit of rocking, but I was able to get the car out of the snow and back onto the road.

The only thing I don't love about driving in the snowy cold like this is related to the wipers. I find that they tend to freeze quickly and are very streaky. It's also easy to jam up the area above the hood where the wipers are located, so it's hard to shoot out the antifreeze onto the windshield in that situation. I might look into buying heated wipers and having them installed.

**Heat**

I know some people have voiced complaints, or concerns, with how the cabin heats up. I find the car warms up *quite* a bit. I tend to keep my interior at around 22 or 23 Celsius, with the fan on at a 2 to a 4 level, and I honestly have to turn down the fan (or the temperature) at times. Only during the coldest moments, when the snow was really falling, did the car feel cold, forcing me to crank the defrost settings in the cabin.  If you are having trouble with your heating in the car, it might be a car issue, and you should talk to someone in service about it.

**Charging**

As mentioned earlier, I keep the car outdoors and charge with the portable charger. Due to the conditions, on a handful of occasions the charge part hasn't closed properly, and snow has gotten into the actual charge area. Snow has also gotten into the tip of the plug. However, it has yet to freeze. If it does, I'm kind of screwed, because we don't own a hair dryer. However, in the two days when the charger itself has gotten a bit snowy, I've just brought it into the house in order to make sure that it properly thaws/dries out. I plan to charge the car tonight, and have no worries about the port freezing. To be fair, I tend to ""condition"" the car for a good 30-60 minutes before I drive it in the morning, as I fire up the heater and sometimes extend my max capacity from 80 to 90% to ensure the battery is warm once I'm on the road.

**License Plate**

In Ontario, we are legally obligated to have license plates at the front and back of the car. To accomplish this, Tesla apoxies the front plate to the car. As I was trying to wipe snow/ice off my car yesterday, my front plate detached and fell to the ground.

On the surface, I find that *relieving.* I was nervous that they'd actually drilled into my car to install the license plate. However, I risk a $200 fine by not having it repaired. So if you are living in stormy, cold conditions, be aware that your front plate could fall off. 

**TL;DR**

The car has done a good job in the bad weather. So far I've felt safe on the roads, I'm not worried about charge loss, the cabin is cozy, and the issues are minimal. This is basically as extreme as extreme weather gets in Toronto, apart from the occasional freezing rain (which would make any car a nightmare to access), and the car has handled it perfectly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/aldv9m/tesla_in_the_vortex_my_experiences_with_my_model/,Haquistadore,87424.0,0.9914
TeslaMotors,complaint,il8wxj,Model 3 Dual Motor - Frequent Tire Replacement,"I love my Tesla, but as time passes I keep finding more and more reasons why it's expensive to own. While my car has had zero mechanical issues in the first two years, I've run into a few small issues:

1. Tires are apparently worn out at 23K miles. These 19"" tires are $1400 or so after tax to replace. Used to run be under $700 to have SUV tires replaced (and they lasted 30-40K on very heavy SUVs like the Pilot or MDX). So in that sense, I am paying double for tires and getting half the mileage. This will add up.
2. Stinky AC issue. While I understand this is a common design flaw across many (or all?) Teslas, it's odd that Tesla is making the customers pay for this. Mine is in the shop today being serviced to remove the foot odor AC smell when the AC first comes on.
3. Charging and mileage. Found out my first winter that the rated mileage for the long range dual motor was not was it was advertised to be, especially in cold weather. I think we now all understand the mechanics of the issue, but it does mean I am paying more for powering the car than expected. In addition, the electric rates in my home state (CT) are very high, and gas is not as much more as expected. 

In the end, still really like the car. The tires are a little bit frustrating, since I just got whacked unexpectedly for 1400 (was expecting to not have to worry about tires for at least another year).",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/il8wxj/model_3_dual_motor_frequent_tire_replacement/,OldBackstop,1015.0,0.003
TeslaMotors,complaint,gbksew,"Here's what 2 years & 50,000 miles with a Model 3 has been like","Two years ago I took delivery of my Model 3. Since then I‚Äôve driven it over 50,000 miles which means I have no more new vehicle warranty. Here's my ownership experience so far.

# Service & Maintenance

Tesla doesn‚Äôt actually require service intervals for the Model 3, but in the manual they do recommend some service at the 2 year mark. Here‚Äôs all the service I‚Äôve had done to my Model 3 in its first two years:

* Driver door handle was closing a little too slowly
* Windshield wiper was making a clicking noise
* Cellular LTE data stopped working
* Driver door was making a clicking noise when opening/closing

**All of those repairs were covered for free under the warranty &amp; fixed by a Tesla Mobile Ranger at my location.** Those were very minor repairs, and none of them prevented me from actually driving the car safely from point A to point B so I will say **the core driving reliability of my Model 3 has been pretty much perfect.**

I get my tires rotated every 15,000 miles, but there‚Äôs a tire place in my city that gives me free rotations so no money spent on that so far. I replaced my tires around 40,000 miles.

Once I hit the 2 year mark I scheduled the recommended service checkup. Tesla quoted me $600 for cabin air filter replacement, wiper blades replacement, brake caliper cleaning, and brake fluid replacement. This was a sticker shock, but since this is all *recommended* and not actually *required* I requested only the brake caliper &amp; brake fluid service which cost $390.

After factoring in the $30 DIY air filter replacement, the total I‚Äôve spent on maintenance (minus new tires) comes to about ‚Äì wait for it ‚Äì $420. *Elon, I see what you did there*. That means **I‚Äôve spent about $8 on maintenance for every 1,000 miles traveled**. Not bad at all if you ask me.

# Charging Cost

Some people who have never owned an EV are quick to bring up the argument *‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt it take long to charge? Where will you charge it? Are you scared you‚Äôll run out of battery?‚Äù*

I‚Äôve never run out of battery or been stranded, and **about** **90% of the charging happens at home overnight while I sleep when electricity is very cheap**. Owning an electric vehicle has saved me both time and money by never having to stop at gas stations during my normal daily driving.

The only time I charge at a Tesla Supercharger station is when I‚Äôm traveling on a road trip. In fact **I‚Äôve only Supercharged 29 times during my first 52,000 miles and I‚Äôve only spent $54 on Supercharging** (my most recent sessions were free from free Supercharging miles)

My off-peak home charging rate is about 7 cents per kWh, and since 90% of my miles traveled were done by charging at home that‚Äôs about 46,800 miles. My Model 3‚Äôs lifetime average efficiency is 244 Wh/mile so (*if we consider a 90% wall to wheels efficiency*) my home charging cost comes to about $900.

After adding in Supercharging, **my total cost to travel 52,000 miles is around $950**. That means for the same cost of 6 months of cable TV you could drive over 50,000 miles in a Tesla Model 3. That‚Äôs pretty crazy.

Of course these are all approximate estimates and personal to my location, but the point is **the cost to drive a Tesla Model 3 is way cheaper and more convenient than any gasoline vehicle**. In fact, most people don‚Äôt even need to get a special charging outlet installed at home. On a normal electrical outlet a Long Range Model 3 can regain 60 miles of range overnight assuming it‚Äôs charging for 12 hours.

# Improvements

I recently made a video about the things I dislike about my Model 3, but the beauty is that Tesla can fix a lot of those complaints through a free software update, which they‚Äôve provided plenty of those since I got my Model 3.

Through free software updates Tesla has given my car fart mode, new games, sophisticated voice commands, and entertainment apps like YouTube and Netflix *(which are a game changer for my wife when we are Supercharging)*

But it‚Äôs not just new quirky features being added. Legitimate improvements to the actual performance of the Model 3 have come from software updates. My car has become 10% quicker since getting it in 2018, and my driving efficiency has improved from things like the ‚ÄúHold‚Äù feature.

Tesla also pushed a software update that improved the Model 3‚Äôs motor efficiency and based on the Tesla Stats app, my estimated range is 329 miles. That means **after 2 years and 50,000 miles my ""estimated"" battery range has** ***increased*** **by 19 miles**. That‚Äôs unheard of and completely crushes the argument that the battery will need to be replaced any time soon due to degradation.

Other cool new features include Smart Summon which lets the car drive to me in a parking lot (*albeit I hardly ever use it in real world scenarios*), along with Sentry Mode which records security footage from the car‚Äôs cameras and lets me view the footage directly from the touch screen display.

Then of course there's Autopilot which is constantly improving and getting better as more Tesla owners drive their cars which makes the neural network exponentially more intelligent with each mile driven.

This type of dynamic improvement cannot be found on any other car. **The Model 3 is an absolutely amazing vehicle, and an even more enjoyable piece of technology**. It‚Äôs truly a giant gadget that brings so much joy and convenience to me as an owner while also improving the environment ever so slightly by making me never need nor want a gas car ever again.

TeslaMotors,complaint,jkebxj,Clarification on Auto-dimming Mirrors,"So Service has recently contacted me regarding some calibration issue for the front Autopilot cameras. Either way I asked them  - while we are at it - whether they could have a look at the auto-dimming mirrors because they get super dark at night and they get barely usable at all to the point where that is somewhat dangerous. I have previously looked at this topic online and some people speculated that it worked with the time of the day, some said it worked when it detected bright lights from behind etc. 

Today I get a definitive answer since they have sent me this, which for sure not actual code it does seem somewhat technical (translated from Spanish): ""

""The Model3 will dim the mirrors to half their brightness when the following are present: \* The sun is down(UI\_solarElevationAngle  <-5 degrees, calculated using GPS and time of day) \* The headlights are on (DAS\_headlightRequest =  DAS\_HEADLIGHT\_REQUEST\_ON or DAS\_HEADLIGHT\_REQUEST\_INVALID) \* Whether it is in gear (DI\_gear) is D o N""

TeslaMotors,complaint,hde6xb,My experience with Tesla Solar,"With all the increase in attention to the product I thought I'd share my experience having just gone through the install process for this stuff.

------
##Basic Timeline and Cost

**1/28/2020:** Order placed for 3.78kW system + Powerwall. Total cost for solar: $10,500.08 (Powerwall got separated -- more on this later). I referred myself for a supposed $250 I should get back and there was a promotion for $250 to install by end-of-March. More on this later.

**1/30/2020:** Home assessment scheduled for February 21, 2020

**2/21/2020:** Home assessment -- they came over and looked at my roof. It's a nearly flat (very slight angle) roof that points basically directly at the sun in Northern California with no trees or other things obstructing it. Nearly perfect for solar.

**2/24/2020:** Informed that Powerwall installation would be delayed to at least Fall 2020 due to backlog of orders (thanks PG&E). Given the opportunity to split order into solar and Powerwall so I could proceed with solar before Fall. I think they forgot to create the separate Powerwall order for me though, so I'm going to have to deal with that later.

**2/24/2020:** Design given to me for approval.

**2/27/2020:** More documents to upload and sign online. Install scheduled for March 18, 2020.

**3/16/2020:** Confirmation email for install. Also, COVID ramps up and shelter-in-place issued.

**3/17/2020:** Installation moved back several weeks due to shelter-in-place. This happened three times. Install eventually scheduled for May 5th. Was told I would still get the $250 bonus for March install. We'll see if that's true.

**5/5/2020:** Panels installed. Took a day. Initial payment (half of solar total) due (payment made through PayPal).

**6/1/2020:** Install inspection scheduled for June 3rd.

**6/3/2020:** Inspection completed; final invoice sent and second payment due (payments made through PayPal).

**6/10/2020:** Application submitted by Tesla to PG&E for approval.

**6/17/2020:** System approved for use! Turned on!

So overall if you remove the delays from COVID it seems like the order-to-power-on timeline was approximately **3 and a half months**. The worst part was having the panels sitting on my roof for a month and a half without being able to turn them on just waiting for the necessary approvals.

-------
##Production

You should never expect to get the full 3.78kW output at any given moment. We are in perfect season for solar right now and with no clouds in the sky, sun directly overhead, our system outputs around **2.8kW** peak output. Again, with basically as perfect solar panel placement as you could get.

In addition, our system's ""Total Effective Inverter Nameplate Rating"" is just 3.419 kW anyways.

What Tesla says is for the best months you multiply your system rating by 5-7 to get your estimated daily output. So we should get 18.9kWh to 26.46kWh on perfect days in the summer months, which seems about right.

For those of you who care, the actual panels we have are: 12x Hanwha Q CELLS - Q.PEAK DUO BLK-G5/SC 315

And the inverter is a Delta Electronics Inc - M4-TL-US [240V] [SI1-FWVW]

--------
##The App

System status is only available from within the Tesla mobile app, not online.

You can view:

* Live production. This is done via the gateway/inverter pairing and you can see your home consumption/grid interaction if you have a PowerBlaster installed (which we do).

* Impact. This is the overall production vs usage stats for your home. You can view a particular day, week, month, year, or lifetime.
* Energy Usage. This shows a graph of your production, home usage, and grid interaction also for a day, week, month, year, or lifetime.

Apparently more functionality is unlocked when you get a Powerwall.

--------
##Issues / Customer Experience

We've had one ongoing issue so far, which seems to stem from bad communication between our gateway (little black box we plug into our router to communicate with the inverter) and the inverter, which is the app reports a stoppage of production at random times at random intervals throughout the day. See a fairly normal graph [here](https://i.imgur.com/HK5Bcxt.jpg), vs a nearly identical day [here](https://i.imgur.com/RdHjXig.jpg).

Whenever I've called Tesla Solar (888-765-2489) I've been able to get to a human (assuming it's in business hours) fairly quickly and they've always been very friendly. I'm currently waiting a few days to see if the lack of production reported in the app (see the images attached) is reflected on PG&E's readings. If the drop in production is reflected with PG&E then it's a system issue, if the drop is not mirrored with PG&E then it is an inverter/gateway communication issue. Otherwise, no complaints so far.

--------
Overall, it was a pretty seamless experience, although some of the image/documentation upload pages on the Tesla website leave a lot to be desired (it'll say ""go take a picture of your meter"" so you do, then upload it, then next page will say ""go take a picture of the wall with your meter"" so you do, then upload it, then the next page will say ""go take a picture of your main breakers, etc., etc., which just has you running back and forth for an annoying period of time). Also, yes I am salty that immediately after I turn my system on a more efficient, cheaper system is made available.

TeslaMotors,complaint,99wmop,"Model 3 hit piece by German ""Die Welt""","Just stumbled upon this ""report"" from half an our ago by ""Die Welt"" title is: [""Testing the Tesla Model 3: This EV is a disappointment""](https://www.welt.de/motor/fahrberichte-tests/elektro-hybrid/article181288590/Tesla-Model-3-im-Test-Dieses-E-Auto-ist-eine-Enttaeuschung.html)


It's riddled with inaccurate information and biased wording, coupled with highly questionable opinions that are the opposite of what we have heard so far from other journalists and owners that have driven the car.
I don't know how good the Google translation is, but will try to highlight some things I deemed questionable.


Some examples:

* Right in the first paragraph knocking it for not having a hatchback and instead a small trunk opening. I think the consesus is, after the revisision from the prototype the opening is on par with other cars in this sedan class.

* Saying the central screen is a dissapointment, the graphics seem outdated. Like what? The Model 3 screen is probably the best on the market right now including the design of the graphics. Also saying that safety relevant options are hidden inside complicated submenus. Wrong, once configured you don't need to dig into submenus for everyday driving, and don't get me started on digging into submenus on traditional brands infotainment systems. Also he was randomly mentioning that the Screen is not of much use when it's crashing and that this happened to them whith a Model S before. Uhmm okay grasping at any straw to spin this negativ now?

* Ending the segment with saying Model 3 interior has poor materials and sloppy worksmanship. Most everybody sitting in a Model 3 premium interior was telling it feels good quality and assembled well, especially in the higher VIN ranges.

* Knocking on the luggage volume but telling atleast there is a frunk for some handluggage. Also mentioning the frunk wouldn't be there with the AWD version. Outright false the AWD has the same frunk and luggage room is regarded plenty by most.

* He states that range of 500 km (310 miles) is in ideal circumstances and in real world it's far less. I think with Tesla sandbagging the EPA range it's pretty achievable in casual day to day driving.

* Now to driving: Handling wasn't impressive and steering wasn't outstanding. Now every test of the Model 3 I read before said these were outstanding, combined with the instant acceleration (which he totally glossed over) it's a joy to ride. The brakes were weak and thermal management for battery and motor was kicking in after some agressive driving. He should try a hotlap on any other stock car and tell how good the brakes are holding up. Also with the switching of motor architectur Tesla got the thermal problem of S and X under control and I've not heard of many instances of throtteling.

* He's saying the Model 3s average handling doesn't come with an increase in comfort, it rolls hard and feels uncomfortable. For the rear passengers long distance travelling would be a torture. When Tesla changed the springs approx in January of this year there were no further complaints with comfort, of course it's not floaty like an airride but it's regarded as a good compromise between sporty and comfort.

* Now bashing autopilot for the recent deaths and telling there were numerous instances of it swerving and giving control back to the driver in their drive. Of course it's an assistance system so the driver needs to be aware all time. He makes it sound like a complete unusable and unsafe feature while neglecting thousands using it everyday on their commute and regarding it as the best driver assist today.

* Then a segment about the ""Musk-cult"" and the ""Musk-fanboys"" knocking on the easter eggs in the car. Hint: nobody has to use those okay? If you can't have fun atleast let us have it instead. Also saying the 35k$ version only exists in the ""prayers and hopes"" of the customers that put down a deposit of 1k$. If you didn't notice it's completly refundable (he didn't mention that). Also saying because of this and the only version beeing available for atleast 49k$ the demand for the the Model 3 is dwindeling.

* At last he concludes it's a shame the Model 3 had so much more potential. Everybody who wants to take the risk on this car with rushed development should atleast wait and testdrive it beforehand and not put down a deposit in good faith.

TeslaMotors,complaint,wmo24t,EV Chargers at work,"I asked the mods if I could post this here, and they may take it down if it isn't up to Rule 2 standards. If so, I'll post in r/electricvehicles.

Recently, I was tasked with finding a charger to install at my workplace. There is only a single EV in the lot right now, and that is my Tesla Model 3. However, there are at least 2 Model Ys on order and a Cybertruck. So the company thought it's time to consider the future.

We didn't want to just get Tesla chargers, in case people come in with a Bolt or whatever. My requirements were J1772, have the ability to bill employees for charging, and not be public chargers that anyone off the street can use which also means it can't show up on a map.

My first stop was ChargePoint. They seem to be the standard when it comes to chargers. Looking at their website, they have the CPF50 which seems like the perfect option. Upon contacting them, I learn that the CPF50, a $2k charger, is software locked to a single car/account. That's stupid. So what else do they have? A large pedestal unit costing upwards of $15k for a dual charger. All because they made the decision to software lock the cheaper unit. Do companies seriously pay this? And then they were super dodgy when it came to the subscriptions and who actually owned the hardware.

So I found Enel X and the JuiceBox Pro. The sales guy I talked to over there was astounded at the fact that they wanted that much for a Level 2 charger. They thought it was a DC fast charger. So they came back with about $7,500 for 4 total chargers and the subscriptions necessary to set payment options. The entire setup we are looking for, half the cost of a single charger with ChargePoint. Ownership and subscriptions were also very clear. We own the hardware, $120/year subscription to get management and billing tools.

Personally, I feel we should just buy some cheaper wall mounted home chargers and call it a day. It'll cost less than $3,000 and we don't have to mess with any subscriptions. We are a manufacturing facility, get primary power from the power company, and have a $42k to $52k electric bill each month. EV charging isn't going to add much to that, especially with 1 EV in the lot right now. Not to mention the fact that I won't be using it if I have to pay more than my home rate.

I'm curious if anyone knows of any other charger brands that we should look into, or if they have recommendations based on a setup at their workplace.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/wmo24t/ev_chargers_at_work/,tylermartin86,11278.0,0.9125
TeslaMotors,complaint,epfrp7,Tesla Model 3 in extreme winter,"Long time lurker, first time poster. 

Currently in one of the coldest places on Earth where it's been -40 for days (today/yesterday apparently -53C with windchill) and have the good, the bad, and the ugly with our M3 I'd like to share (and see if anyone else in this frozen wasteland is having the same issues).

First the good:

1. I love the fact my car still starts. So many people with gas cars have been stuck in a bind because their batteries have frozen solid and their car can't start. Even being left outside in the -40 it had zero issues starting
2. Also love the fact my car warms 50 degrees warmer than the outside temp and I can see a) when it's no longer cold af in the cab of the car and b) it only takes 15 mins for it to go 60 degrees warmer than outside temp.
3. Really impressed that so far the LCD screen/tablet has had no issues whatsoever
4. Brakes and maneuvering on ice have been great. Surprisingly good handling unless I accidentally-on-purpose drift around a corner
5. Only lost 10% battery power in 12h parked outside at freeze-your-face-off weather temps with sentry running.

Now for the bad (really just minor complaints):

1. Range is less than ideal (I'm at about 50% of what I'd normally expect) but not terrible
2. Wanted the electric motor ooomph passing a car I was stuck behind that thought merging into a 110kph highway going 50kph (why?!) was a good idea. Didn't have the electric motor oomph. And for the first time I noticed the dashed lines on the right hand side of the regen/energy bar. More just boring gas car grumbling accel instead of electric car zoomiez. Who knew it isn't just the regen that's non-existent that cold? (Lol)

Now for the ugly... that I'm not sure if it's just the fact I'm in why-do-I-live-where-the-weather-hurts-my-face-ville or if it's an issue with my own vehicle that I need to speak with a service tech about:

1. When it's cold enough the penguins at the zoo aren't allowed outside, the windows do not go back up on automatically like usual on door-close. They have to ""manually"" (using the window control buttons) be elevated (and even then it's easy to tell the motor doesn't like doing it at all by the sad noise it makes). Not an issue when I'm getting in to drive it as such bc I'm inside and can press the ""window go up"" button, but it's an issue when I leave the car and the window doesn't automatically go all the way up bc there's no way for me to ""force"" it to. Question is: is this just because it's cold enough to freeze an egg solid on the sidewalk in less than 3min or is there something wrong with the car?
2. The car has no issues blowing beautifully hot air into the cab when I've used the app or am sitting in it before stepping on the brake to put it in gear. But when I'm driving it, the air that blows is actually comparatively quite cool regardless of whether I have it on air recirc or not. Even the front defrost when on is quite cool. Any clues as to why? I know in my previous gas car this was the case until the engine warmed up enough, but Jarvis is already obviously warm and has no issues blowing hot air because it was doing just that 5 min beforehand.

TeslaMotors,complaint,f3sdfi,HW3 Upgrade Experience,"A couple of weeks ago I made an appointment to get my Model 3 hardware upgraded to HW3 (I asked for Mobile Service as the service center is 50 miles away but they changed it to be at the SC)

I was optimistically hopeful that I would hang around that day while they did it but was told at check in by my service advisor they needed the car for two days and he found a Model S for me to borrow (thanks Victor!)

No ‚Äúcome and get it‚Äù on day 2 and on day 3 a message saying it isn‚Äôt finished yet and I will get a status update on day 4. Still on day 3 I checked in the app and saw the work was now scheduled to be completed on day 7

This is not a complaint about Tesla service - I am **very** happy with both how they have kept me updated and the fact they have loaned me a car but I am curious to know if others have experienced a long HW3 upgrade.

TeslaMotors,complaint,9l3vfr,My Model S 5 years later: I really shouldn't like it,"I'm writing this because my 2013 Model S is about to go back to the shop because the motor sounds like it wants to die (again).


You can also take my experience as a warning that you probably shouldn't buy a used Model S and/or why you shouldn't be an early adopter (or even why you shouldn't buy a Tesla at all).


My car was delivered May 2013.  Premium interior, tech package, 19in alloys, 60kWh battery.  No glass roof, no Super Charging, nothing too fancy.  Cost about $68,000.  It now has a little over 90k miles on it.  


********************************************************


The good:

* üôå never needing to buy gas üôå
* no more dealing with ICE things like smog and oil changes
* it's quick and handles great
* it was super unique and cool for the first few years


The bad:


**The interior build quality and design is garbage.**

* Not even for a car of this price, but for every modern car.  This is my biggest complaint.  Having to replace the rear seats on the first day because of how badly the leather was installed was a sign of things to come.  It has aged terribly.  Today the interior is a creaky, rattly mess.  Panels are loose and everything squeaks: the seats, steering wheel (buttons and scroll wheels included), the dash, door handles (interior and exterior), probably the cupholders, etc etc.  Little Tikes' cars are more solid than this.

* The design of the interior reflects the build quality.  Only two cupholders in the car that also happen to be in the most inconvenient spot.  No door or seat pockets.  Stupid small sun shades and mirrors (that Tesla still uses today lol), no storage space besides the tiny glovebox.  It also doesn't help that that it sounds like the car doesn't have any sort of sound proofing.  I can hear everything outside and everyone outside can hear everything going on inside.   

**Questionable Reliability**

* This upcoming appointment to have them fix whatever is wrong with the drive unit is going to be its third fix, and unfortunately I don't think it's going to be it's last until I pony up the cash just to replace the whole thing.  

* The car needs to be rebooted about 2-3 times a month because bluetooth or data just stops working

* Sometimes the car can't charge at 10kW at home and will only do 3kW and no one really knows why (my Model 3 doesn't have this problem with the same old UMC and outlet)

* [Oh yeah, an update bricked my car last year requiring a $2,500 MCU replacement (that Tesla *eventually* refunded)](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/6nanze/last_update_may_have_bricked_my_car/)

* edit: Oh and I had the first MCU replaced because of the bubbles


********************************************************


I  have Stockholm Syndrome.  My experience with this Model S doesn't give me much confidence in the long term reliability of my 6-month old Model 3 (also because it too has a stupid amount of build quality issues).  No Toyota or Nissan or Honda I've ever had has given me this much extra trouble.  And they've definitely had better build quality at less than half the price.  Despite all that crap, for some reason I still like this car.  

And I'll probably buy the Tesla pickup truck whenever that comes out.

TeslaMotors,complaint,atnpux,"Warning : Model 3 Roof Rack can easily break, fall off car while driving","So like many I was very happy when the model 3 roof rack finally went back in stock early feb, was able to get one (so can stop driving to the ski mountain and having to put seats down).

unfortunately it seems like Tesla has big quality issue with the J brackets that attach to the car as the mounting point of the rack. Essentially when installing the roof rack, you slide these J brackets under the metal frame of the roof where there are two arrows in the glass

https://imgur.com/ps2Kava

You then put a pad on top of it, put the crossbar on top of the pad, and torque down an allen wing nut onto the bolt of the bracket. Maximum recommended torque is 8Nm (6 Ft lbs). 

https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/installing-the-official-tesla-model-3-roof-rack.139045/page-4

Here is a thread from multiple users, some who had service center installations, where these brackets are breaking. Including my own, photo below

https://imgur.com/TznyfBW

https://imgur.com/yIkdBSI

If you have one of these racks would highly recommend you check it frequently or remove it until Tesla actually gives an answer on what the problem is (substandard metal, poor design, improper torque instructions, who knows). For now they seem to be evading the question and just saying ""we will ship out new brackets soon"". Hence this PSA for anyone who has a roof rack.


Edit: update from TMC. A user with an older roof rack was checking and found his bolts dont have that gap in them. It looks like they may have simply installed the threaded bolt higher (this was a complaint on the original). But this creates a massive weak point. We will have to see.

For instance, in Germany, Austria and Switzerland we have Ionity Fast Charging that max out the Model 3 charging power. In summer, you get 200kW easy.
The problem we are facing in winter is that battery may need to be pre-heated more heavily and if preconditioning does not start on time, you get crappy lower speeds.
The workaround is to tell the car to drive to a nearby SuC then cancel the navigation once arrived to Ionity. This sucks. So either make the Nav software recognize other fast chargers or add a freaking button somewhere to tell it to precondition the battery! This has been a major complaint from many European YouTubers.

TeslaMotors,complaint,jsc712,Whoever came up with the 500km range has never driven in Germany.,"As clarification for non Germans:
130 kmh is considered normal speed on our Autobahn. That means one should generally try to go that speed, if the limit isn‚Äòt lower.  
  
  
First of all, I of course realize that the 500km range is advertisement and that nobody says I would reach that with going 200 all the time.  
  
But by how much it is exaggerated does still surprise me a fair bit:  
   
Going an average of 130 kmh gives me a range of less than 450km, even if I went 100-0%, which is absolutely unrealistic due to the distances between chargers.  
  
Today I drove 700km, I had to charge three times. Now that by itself doesn‚Äôt mean a lot, but I have a specific example from that drive:  
I charged to 93%, the rest of the trip was 294km. Now this shouldn‚Äôt be problem, I thought.  
But after about 10 minutes of going between 140 and 170, the car tells be to stay under 140 to reach destination.  
Now this is a problem, and means I have 300km of range with a full charge. Yes I am driving faster than anticipated, but 300 kilometers?  
  
Now I still wouldn‚Äòt want any other car. Not ever. But I think this should be more commonly known, because after all the range thing is still the most common complaint by potential buyers.  
  
  
Am I too harsh? Does anyone have similar experiences?

TeslaMotors,complaint,gyejj2,"Comparing the Y to the rest of the fleet (S,3,X)","I've owned a P3D for the last \~year, and had a Model 3 RWD for a year prior to that (yes, I had a very low VIN). I recently had the opportunity to test drive a Y AWD, and would like to share my impressions compared to my 3s, along with the S and X (the former of which I've driven extensively, the latter of which only through a few test drives).  

**Y: overall impressions**

My first impressions of the Y, as many others agree with, is that it looks and feels just like a slightly enlarged 3.  This is not surprising.  The seats are a bit higher up and give you a standard crossover feel.  Note: it does NOT feel like driving an SUV.  You are not that high up.  It will be a bit easier to get into and out of compared to the 3, but we are not in SUV territory here.  I'm 6' tall, and I had plenty of headroom when sitting at a comfortable position - much more headroom than in a 3.  Other than that, everything feels exactly like a 3 - same screen, interface, etc.  The steering wheel no stitching on it at 10 and 2 (compared to the 3, which does), which I liked. 

**Y: rear view and storage**

As others have mentioned, the view through the rear window is comically small. Literally the worst rear view in any vehicle I've driven.  The root cause of this is actually my biggest complaint about the Y.  I actually don't care much that the rear view itself is small - you just need to know if there are vehicles back there, and you can see that well enough when driving.  My main complaint is that there is not nearly as much storage (or room for seating) in the back.  I wish they would have designed the rear to be a little taller, more SUV-like and less crossover-like.  I have a \~60lbs dog who is fairly tall.  I don't think he'll fit in the back very comfortably with the rear seats up. He will definitely not be able to stand on 4 legs, or even sit up. 

I have no idea how they'll ever get an additional two forward facing seats in there in the 7 seat interior.  I just don't see how it's possible. If you remove the cover of the rear storage area in the trunk area, I could see how two rear facing seats could possibly fit, but it will still be tight.  I imagine this will only be comfortable for small children - kind of like the S. 

With all that said, the storage in the Y is definitely improved over the 3.  The hatchback is wonderful. It's nice to finally get an auto open and close feature. I like that the rear seats can be reclined (at least a bit). Note that there are buttons in the hatchback area that will lay the rear seats down flat - but they won't come back up via the button - you have to manually bring them back up. I do have to say, however, that the storage area in the rear is rather narrow - much more narrow than I'm used to in SUVs.  Perhaps due to a combination of the narrow body, wheel wells, and electronics.  The frunk is technically larger than that of the 3, but I'm not sure how useful that is - the 3 can already fit a carry-on suitcase, and it's not clear you could fit more than a carry-on suitcase in the Y's frunk.  It's a bit deeper, but that doesn't help much.  

**Y: handling and road noise** 

The Y handled very similar to a 3 that is enlarged and raised.  Acceleration and cornering is a bit worse, but still a joy to drive. Compared to the X, the Y feels light and nimble.  I was not able to test a Performance Y, so I couldn't compare directly to my P3D.  However, after driving the Y, I can safely say that I am just so incredibly happy with my P3D. It's even lighter and more nimble than the Y, with far better driving dynamics and acceleration.  I imagine this will also be true when comparing to a performance Y, but of course I can't say for certain. 

One of my biggest complaints about the 3 is road noise - it's much louder than I think it should be at speeds above 55 mph for a vehicle in its price range.  I even added extra rubber gaskets around all of my doors to help this in my P3D.  Alas, the Y unfortunately inherits this road noise issue. It's just as bad above 55 mph.  Note that I have a P3D that was manufactured before any of the supposed road noise improvements, and I felt that the Y was just as bad as my P3D with my additional gaskets.

**Compared to the X**

The model X is a beast. When you step on the accelerator, you can tell the vehicle is doing a lot of work to propel it forward. I recently test drove a 2020 Performance X (long range +) with Ludicrous+ mode. It's impressive that a vehicle of that size can be so quick.  I didn't have enough time to heat up the battery pack to enable Ludicrous+ mode, but I was honestly not thrilled with acceleration and performance in normal Ludicrous mode.  Yes, it's fast, but it's just not nimble.  Not that I would expect this from an SUV.  The P3D is just such a better drive in nearly all aspects, IMO.  I was very glad to get back into my P3D after driving the X, which has instant acceleration at any time without having to do any battery heating.  

With all that said, I love the X as an SUV. The rear storage space area is much larger (both in height and width) compared to the Y.  I could comfortably fit my dog in here. The falcon wing doors are of course amazing. The 6 seat interior is really amazing and perfect for families with children. 

After driving both the Y and X back-to-back, I have to say that I would prefer the X for my purposes.  The Y is a better, more nimble drive, but if you want a better more nimble drive - you're looking at the wrong vehicles. Get a P3D or a performance S. The reason you're looking at a Y/X is for space, presumably - either for gear, kids, dogs, etc. In this aspect, the X wins hands down.  The only point the Y wins on here is the ability to have a roof rack (if you need that sort of thing). 

Despite this, I'm not personally willing to spend $80k+ on a vehicle, so I am keeping my RWD 7-seater Y reservation for now.  I'm keeping an eye out on the used Model X market, but prices just do not seem commensurate with the recent new vehicle prices.  Why would I spent \~$70k on a 2017 90D with 30,000 miles when I can get a new 2020 Long Range + with far better tech and range and 0 miles for $80k?  I don't really want to go for a 2016 90D (which you can get for \~$55-60k) due to all the problems with 90D batteries and 2016 Model X's. If the used market changes to reflect new pricing, I may consider a 2017, but it's hard to say. I'd really hate the significantly decreased range for an older model.  We'll have to see. 

**Compared to the S**

Frankly, the S is actually the best comparison point for the Y.  Hatchback, similar amount of cargo space, etc.  But the S feels like a boat compared to the Y.  There's no question in my mind that I would prefer a Y over an S for my own personal needs. I already have a P3D for my own driving needs, and I don't require sub-3 second 0-60 for my family car. 

**Final impressions**

The Y is exactly what I (and everyone else) expected - an enlarged 3.  It fits my needs almost perfectly, expect for the not-quite-large-enough rear storage space, and an unknown ability to fit 7 humans inside. For this reason, I am still waffling between a used X and a new 7-seat Y when it becomes available.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/gyejj2/comparing_the_y_to_the_rest_of_the_fleet_s3x/,jamesclerkmaxwell4,2324.0,0.999
TeslaMotors,complaint,t196u3,FSD Beta 10.10.2 - Model X versus Model 3,"As both my Model X and 3 are synced up on FSD Beta 10.10.2 I wanted to take a moment and do a brief comparison of how the beta runs on both of them.  The Model X biggest the biggest Tesla, and the Model 3 being the smallest, I thought it‚Äôd be interesting to see a bit of a comparison is how the beta handles in the different sized vehicles, and the different ages.

I tried to keep the time of day, and the route, as close as possible, however, the cars at time chose different navigation routes to get to destinations, and 

The Model X traveled [this path]( https://imgur.com/z8zANQm) while the Model 3 traveled [this path]( https://imgur.com/RdwlGsA).  Any deviations in the two routes are the result of the Tesla navigation system deciding to route differently, with the exception of one spot where I force it to go in a different direction.

You can watch the Model X drive using [this link here]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhojqzAeOzw) and the Model 3 drive is [here]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgliFK9frQ4)

The Model X is a 2017 with AP 2.5 cameras, and the Model 3 is a 2019 SR+.  Both had their radars turned off when they joined the FSD Beta.  The X is my daily driver, and the 3 is my wife‚Äôs daily driver.  This is important to note if you watch the videos because the 3 has *a lot* of accidental disengagements because I wasn‚Äôt used to how sensitive it is.  Anyone who says they have a hard time disengaging FSD Beta can go take a hike.  *Super* easy to disengage the thing, which let to a lot of accidental disengagements.

The short and skinny of the experience was:

* The Model X tends to be more uncertain when the roads are narrow, while the Model 3 doesn‚Äôt.  Largely because of its size.
* The Model 3 tends to angle the wheels left a bit before it turns right.   The Model X does not.
* The Model X doesn‚Äôt have a cabin camera, as such I didn‚Äôt get nearly as many nags as the Model 3.  Some of the Model 3 nags were bullshit though.  Hands were *always* on the wheel as torqued as much as possible, while not disengaging.
* The Model X doesn‚Äôt automatically turn on auto high beams.  The video above is recording with the high beams off the entire time.  The Model 3 forces the high beams on when Autopilot is engaged, so I just let them do their thing.
* The Model 3 tends to do some *really* tight turns that look like it‚Äôs going to curb, versus the Model X, which I feel does them more comfortably.
* Neither vehicle seems more, or less, confident in what it can do, and for the most part operate in the same manner, aside from the above noted differences

Some interesting moments in the video are

* Neither vehicle slows down for railroad tracks.  [Model X]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhojqzAeOzw&t=300s) versus [Model 3]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgliFK9frQ4&t=235s)

* When making left turns to a two lane one-way street the vehicle appears to have a bias for going into the right most lane, despite the left one being a better option.  I assume this is a training issue of ‚ÄúOh, turning left?  Ok, get into the right lane‚Äù while semi ignoring the directionality of the road.  [Model X goes right into right lane]( https://youtu.be/DhojqzAeOzw?t=952) versus [Model 3 goes right into the right lane]( https://youtu.be/bgliFK9frQ4?t=925)
* Road closures do trip the vehicles up.  This isn‚Äôt a perfect comparison, because barricades were up, and closer to the road for the Model X, and the Model 3 didn‚Äôt have the barricades.  Fence and ‚ÄúStop‚Äù were still there for both vehicles though.

TeslaMotors,complaint,i4tsov,I Turo‚Äôd a Model S P100DL - My Experience,"After surely getting sick of me ranting and raving about Tesla‚Äôs at nearly every chance I get, my family surprised me with an awesome gift- the rental of a fully loaded P100D with FSD. The host was amazing as was the car and experience as a whole. This wasn‚Äôt my first time driving a PxDL Tesla, but I hadn‚Äôt for anything longer than minutes till now.

However, I don‚Äôt think it pushed me towards being a customer. (get your downvotes ready) my car background- I have an attachment to bmws that I can‚Äôt help. I don‚Äôt seek them out but they‚Äôve given me exactly what I wanted for the price I wanted twice in a row, and seem to have my number this time around, too. I used to own a 650i, then sold it, went car-less for a while and picked up a 328i which was meant to be somewhat temporary, but has ended up serving me quite well save for missing some stuff I‚Äôd like, namely TACC and more power. A family member has an M3 (bmw, not model 3) which I drive fairly frequently. I casually have my eyes on a used 90D to retrofit with ap3, the bmw m550, and the Mercedes e43 AMG. I view the 3 of them as being in the same general territory. I love Tesla and the idea of owning an electric car but I‚Äôm not married to it. And I‚Äôm very picky, perhaps too picky for a Tesla at this time.

The good:

- It goes without saying at, but its acceleration is sublime. It‚Äôs literally heart-stopping and a joy to drive. There‚Äôs nothing else like it.
- Its overall road feel is also completely on point. The ride is just stiff enough to be fun but still comfortable. It handles in a way that lets you mostly (but not completely) forget about its size and weight.
- I think it‚Äôs the best-looking car on the road. I love its design. It hasn‚Äôt changed much in around 8 years and yet it always has me turning my head.
- The body style, large hatchback, is perfect. I wish more automakers embraced it. The only similar ones are the Audi A7, Porsche Panamera and discontinued BMW Gran Turismo. And none of them are executed as well as the Tesla when it comes to utilizing space.
- So much cargo space. More than small and even mid-sized SUV‚Äôs.
- I love the regenerative braking. It‚Äôs very easy to control one‚Äôs speed, both up and down.

The okay:
- I found the front seats to be pretty good. It‚Äôs one of the rare ones that has ventilated seats, and while they aren‚Äôt the best, they actually do do what they‚Äôre supposed to, which is whisk sweat off your back to prevent your shirt from sticking to them. But my family‚Äôs opinions were mixed. Overall they‚Äôre similar, maybe a little lower in comfort to the ones found in 3-series/C-Class/A4 etc. Not at the level of higher-end premium seats.
- Autosteer veered out of its lane several times. I don‚Äôt feel too comfortable relying on it. I don‚Äôt mind steering though, but I find TACC critical. And it‚Äôs very good in that regard. (But competing luxury sedans are pretty competitive here)
- I don‚Äôt want to diminish how exhilarating it is to drive, but there‚Äôs a limit to how much acceleration one can typically make use of. Like many of you I probably see during my daily commute, I spend a decent chunk of time in stop and go traffic on the 101, and no amount of hp can put a dent in that. I drove the (BMW) M3 home after dropping it off so that both cars‚Äô feels were fresh in my mind. The Tesla was noticeably quicker to around 30, but from 50-100, it‚Äôs hard to feel a difference (or even get the opportunity), despite the bmw being objectively slower. Tesla in ludicrous+, bmw in sport+. 
- There‚Äôs a notion that Tesla‚Äôs are untouchable in a straight line, which isn‚Äôt far off, but the likes of the Mercedes e63 and bmw m5 are competitive in price, size and even raw speed numbers. I wish I had been able to try one of those back-to-back with the Tesla.

The not so good:
- The rear seats are terrible. There‚Äôs no sugar coating it. They‚Äôre essentially seat cushions bolted directly to the floor, presumably because the battery is directly below them. They aren‚Äôt even suitable for average sized adults on anything but short trips. Lack of bolsters makes things worse. 
- The cargo capacity is complete overkill yet the rear of the cabin is not as spacious as you‚Äôd expect given the size of the car. Makes me wonder if they could‚Äôve somehow traded some the former for the latter.
- No cup holders in the back. Nor side pockets on the door. Highly inconvenient. Was not fun for my rear passenger holding a cup of coffee getting flung around on the rear bench seats (my gunning the car certainly didn‚Äôt help, and for that I‚Äôm to blame)
- Despite the lack of engine noise, the road noise on the highway is pretty high. We found ourselves yelling to carry a conversation. My BMW‚Äôs sound damping is much better. It‚Äôs also not very composed, it shakes noticeably past around 80, and you can hear the body panels vibrating. Cars literally 5x cheaper wouldn‚Äôt be expected to suffer from this.
- I really missed being able to open the trunk by swiping my leg as is common on other sedans and suvs. Instead, I had to fumble with the key fob with both hands full of groceries.
- The traffic visualization is pretty cool. But it‚Äôs not as effective as a 360 camera coupled with traditional blind spot monitoring. The owner of the car said he swiped one of the rims due to misjudging the width of the car. I understand some patent/licensing issues prevent Tesla from adding a 360 camera view. It‚Äôs too bad, because the lack of it is conspicuous and a frequent complaint.
- I find the infotainment system pretty nice. But the lack of responsiveness of the touch screen coupled with its position make it inconvenient and unsafe to use while driving. The steering wheel controls mostly get the job done.
- I don‚Äôt own a home. Having to use superchargers was frustrating. I live in the Bay Area, but it was still a challenge to find, say, a supercharger with a nearby Starbucks to kill time. I don‚Äôt think I could get used to this, especially on road trips. Both my apartment building and workplace have chargers, though.
- The fit and finish is a tired complaint, but I do think it‚Äôs fair game, along with the lack of convenience features, considering that this car cost as much a decent house in some parts of the us.  Other sport luxury cars in this class have better appointed interiors, though I understand that‚Äôs not that important for many.
- Another common item for the wishlist - a HUD.

Overall, there were so many things I absolutely loved, but there were also several things I couldn‚Äôt forgive. What frustrates me is that Tesla accomplished incredible things and solved extremely tough, unsolved, problems along the way. Yet, they didn‚Äôt solve problems that have been solved by other automakers decades ago. Most of you won‚Äôt agree with me and that‚Äôs okay. The market has spoken, and it says that the pros outweigh the cons to a huge amount of people.

Overall, for the money, the right German ICE sedan seems to offer a similar level of performance, and even technology, with a lot more comfort, so I haven‚Äôt been weaned away from them yet.

I‚Äôm still definitely going to try a model 3 performance, as it looks like even more fun for a weekend, but I expect it to amplify many of my gripes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i4tsov/i_turod_a_model_s_p100dl_my_experience/,gautamb0,8164.0,0.9989
TeslaMotors,complaint,8f8tp3,[discussion] Refused delivery due to observations - is it fair to request a new VIN? Why or Why-not?,"(deleted prior post & reposted due to bad title... it had 0 comments)

Hi all. Would appreciate your help and suggestions.

Took family to Springfield NJ delivery center today to receive a blue M3, but ended up not taking delivery after making below observations. Because it was end of the day, delivery specialist promised to have his manager call me tomorrow with options. 

    1. 3 or more paint chips on the passenger front door where door meets the fender. SC was not sure how it could have happened either. 
    2. Gap between driver side fender where it meets the A pillar is aeawfully large. Clearly not flush. 
    3. Same issue on the passenger side gap between fender and A pillar. Not as big but still not flush.
    4. Front of both side fenders touch (almost overlap) with the bumper
    5. Both headlights not flush with bumper - headlight is pointed out forward than the bumper - 4-5mm if I remember correctly, especially the driver side.
    6. Charger cover is not flush with the rear light when closed
    7. Most weird - left and right side rear windows do not roll down to the same height. Discovered it after just looking at them though actual difference seems to be about 5mm. Confused if this is a sign of some bigger issue, or just something I can safely let go.
    8. Hairline paint scratches on hood and other places
    9. Scratch on glass panel - this turned out to be glues left in place (why though)‚Äã


They did call technician, and they told me (SC and technician):

    #1- no idea why that happened. They can make it right
    #2 and #3 will be hard to fix. May make it look worse.
    #4 is out of spec and they can make it right
    #5 is actually within spec - I got a bit mad at this point
    #6 is actually within spec - I pretended to let it go, but this just doesn't feel right
    #7 is actually non issue - I need some explanation of why this can happen before believing it
    #8 can be fixed - I agree. Planning to do paint fix and opticoat, so willing to let it go
    #9 is actually remains of glue not scratch
    For tonight, they provided a loaner car (BMW - not Tesla but still nice)... They took my CC info but I am trusting they are covering the full cost.
    

Anyhow... what would you suggest are important ones I need to really address? 

Also, when the manager calls me tomorrow, should I .... (1) accept whatever they can fix (2) demand all to be fixed OR (3) refuse delivery for new VIN? I'm not thinking of cancelling the sale yet.

Still excited about the car but trying to get it right from the start...

Thanks in advance for your thoughts and suggestions

[EDIT with UPDATE - 2 days later]  Hi - after reading through all the comments, I chose to have Tesla repair the issues. However, still some minor drama. Details below. 

- Delivery person promised to call me the next day morning, but did not. I called them 4 times only to get their voice mail. I then called their sales line and got immediately connected to a person, who then connected me to the delivery person. I'm told this happened because the person got sick and they had too many customers. I understand stuff happens, but I don't like it when coincidences happen at convenient times. 
- Took 30 min to talk through issues. They acknowledged issues 1, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9. They offered to have a body shop fix it. That leaves 2, 3, 7 as unresolved.
- For 2 and 3, they advised not trying to fix due to the car's design (seriously?!) I asked them to just make it less noticeable even if not perfect. He said they will try but no commitment what so ever. 
- For 7, I asked to have the car doors and glass panels re-inspected to be sure no material issues. They said they do that anyways, but I'm skeptical at best. This is the one that bothers me the most because it doesn't make sense why that will happen. In addition, I asked them to adjust the windows so they roll down to the same height. They said they'll try but also no commitment.

In all conversations... I appreciated them trying to remain professional and clear on the details. I didn't appreciate the strong undertone these are all cosmetics only and repair is the only option.

This experience is giving me new perspectives on Tesla as an investor. They created a beautiful tech that others will have trouble catching up - but they are so bad at scaling actual operational aspects. This is how typical software companies run - they launch minimally viable products to market, let users drive usage or complaints, and use that as evidence on how to make improve. That works because software does not require people. It's a proven model. However, building cars need people - I'm sorry but indications are piling up they are untrained. QA and Servicing cars need people - this delivery experience is showing they are understaffed at best and missing key checks and balances likely. 

Anyhow... thank you all for options, thoughts and information. Hope all this helps with next owners in waiting...

TeslaMotors,complaint,ab2h74,Notes from my holiday road trip,"tl;dr - lots of uniformed owners on road. Tesla needs to fix this. 

Did 2100 miles (NJ > FL > NJ) this holiday weekend. Model 3 handled fantastic and the ride was better than anything else I‚Äôve driven in last 10 years. Had 2 humans and a cat in the car. It went astonishingly well. 

Biggest complaint isn‚Äôt Supercharger availability (that will be fixed), but customer education. Too many rich people driving P100‚Äôs because they‚Äôre ‚Äúcool‚Äù with absolutely ZERO knowledge of how the car works. Hogging SC stalls to ‚Äúload up 100%‚Äù instead of trusting Navigation instructions. Creates bottleneck much like traffic jams on highway (one person slams on brakes, trickles down the road for miles). 

I literally had to explain to someone that driving slower uses LESS electricity. Blew their mind. Thought ‚Äúidling‚Äù was like an ICE car. ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre telling me my range is less because I‚Äôm driving too fast?‚Äù

Also had to explain to someone why SC charges slower over different battery percentages. No, your car is not broken, you‚Äôre trying to fill the last 10% of battery with a SC. Why are you even bothering? Just stop again and top off in 20 minutes.

Another family was ‚Äúcaravanning‚Äù with us up 95. They were driving an X and stopped at almost every stop we did. In GA, I watched them sit at a stall for almost 2 hours. 2 HOURS! English was not their first language and the convo with the driver was basically ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not full yet‚Äù. They had 220 miles; they were waiting for it to be exactly 100%. Guess what? I saw them at the next SC stop 1 hour away. 

Range Anxiety (Range Ignorance?) is a real thing and education from Tesla itself would be a huge benefit. Can‚Äôt rely on delivery team to do it in 5 minutes - they‚Äôre cranking cars out the shop as quickly as possible. You can‚Äôt fix stupid, but you can help it. 

Simple solution that could be done is mailing by out a one-pager with ‚Äúcharging tips‚Äù that explain common things (temperature, A/B stall priority, total power available to entire SC stop, etc). I suggest physical mailer because it eliminates the tech-illiterate from disregarding an email or YouTube video.

TeslaMotors,complaint,8or29m,"Got Model 3 a week ago, have thoughts / would like feedback [Discussion]","Took delivery on the 27th and I have to say it's by far the best car I've ever driven. No serious complaints at all. I've noticed a few odd things though and would like feedback / opinions on them from other more experienced Tesla owners. I've had my eye on a Tesla since I saw a local Seahawks player driving a Roadster about 10 years ago, and this is my first one!

- There's been a strange shudder in the steering wheel occasionally, very much like what would happen by driving over a rumble strip on the freeway. It lasts about 1 second. I really want to just explain it as a patch of rough road but I've driven on these roads every day for 5 years and never felt this. Possibly just a different suspension I'm not used to. I haven't been able to reliably replicate it but I think it's only happened when the regenerative braking engages. It's minor, but thought I'd mention. Happens once a day at most, it's not that often.

- Setting the charge limit interface is awful. It's just a slider with no feedback on where you're setting it? I can't +/- one % at a time? I can't even see what % I'm setting I just guess ""about there"". I'm being picky but just seems like the design could be improved. I've only set it to 100% for a trip once, then back to 90 (I'm not constantly futzing with it) but I couldn't even tell I had gotten it back to 90 until it charged.''

- editing in one more I forgot: Do the aero wheel covers protect the brakes from road dirt and such? I've tried looking this up but can't find definitive answers. I'm not crazy about the look but I don't want to remove them if they're protecting the brakes.

- This one's my biggest concern. While driving w/ autosteer on, numerous times it has told me to put my hands on the wheel when they're very much on the wheel already. I could understand if I was lightly touching or barely holding the bottom, but I've had both hands resting on the top half of the wheel. It only stops flashing and beeping at me when either I grip extremely tightly or give some force turning the wheel (but not enough to disengage it). This seems like something's wrong otherwise I would think other people would be mentioning that their car is telling them they're hands aren't on the wheel when they are. I haven't asked the service center about this yet, thought I'd get feedback here first.

Really though, the car is amazing. Panel gaps are as consistent as my 2014 Civic, nothing sticks out (charge cover is flush), and drives amazingly. We're driving the future!

TeslaMotors,complaint,6h7ndu,Why I'm waiting a few years to get my Model 3.,"I'm a day 1 reservation holder, so like a lot of folks here, I'm super excited for the Model 3. Maybe I'm being cynical, realistic, but after doing much research on the growing pains of the Model S, this is my brief takeaway of why it's better to wait a few years prior to getting the Model 3. Counter arguments are more than appreciated :D.

1. QC: Maybe it's overblown, but there have always been complaints about various issues the Model S has gone through. Whether it's body panels, chrome fit, the motor, or something else entirely. Giving Tesla 3-4 years will allow the Model 3 to be more refined in that department.

2. Speaking of QC, parts availability. Model S owners have complained at times that they have to leave their car at a service center or certified repair shop longer than expected due to parts availability. Now multiply that factor due to how many Model 3's will be out in the open. I'm pretty positive there will be a scalability issue from both a parts availability and authorized repair shops perspective. Allowing 3-4 years means parts will become more common and more shops will become available to repair your vehicle.

3. Design Refresh: While I do not expect a full overhaul, I do expect certain things to become better. This is natural when you decide to ""wait"", but anything can change. Better materials, better ""look"", bettery battery, more features, and maybe for those folks, a HUD.

Those are the top 3 reasons I can think of. There are some downsides to this. You will most likely miss the 7500 or any version of the tax credit. Pricing might change for the worst. There might not be any design refreshes or improvements made. But for those of us who are willing to wait, I think it'll be worth not having to deal with the growing pains.

TeslaMotors,complaint,ax1sly,Tesla overdelivered on its promise,"When tesla announced the standard and long range options, the standard range was 220 miles for $35k and long range was 310 miles for $44k. There was no mention of premium interior for that price. If you look at the LR option now, here are a list of things that Tesla is delivering over and above their promises - 

1. Long range is 325 miles range (LR RWD) instead of 310 miles. 15 more miles, Thats 5% more! 

2. LR RWD is for $43k instead of $44k 

3. Premium interior features are included in the $43k price which wasnt mentioned in the launch, those features were $5k extra for the longest time in model S.

LR RWD is literally the best bang for the buck. 
Amidst all the complaints out there about the recent price drop, i just wanted to bring this fact out there.

TeslaMotors,complaint,n15pyw,Supercharging credit not being applied by Tesla,"Hello all,

I bought my Tesla X in October of 2018. At that time, I was to receive an ANNUAL 400 kWh supercharging credit.

For 2 years, I received the supercharging, but this year it stopped. I contacted Tesla and waited many months for them to reply. Finally, they stated that I received the 400 kWh and I subsequently used the credits. I explained to them that this was an annual award, but I have not had a reply. I have documentation from my original sales person as well as from the website that this was to be an annual award.

This was on Tesla's site:

Please note that certain Model S and X, sold before November 2, 2018 receive 400 kWh (\~1,000 miles) of Supercharger credits annually. For usage above the complimentary credits provided, a small fee applies.

It is so frustrating not being able to talk to someone personally. The online chat is pretty worthless also as they they just forward my complaint. The Tesla service center is equally unproductive.

TeslaMotors,complaint,5fets0,Do you think I should buy a Tesla?,"Hi, Reddit! I like to read posts on here from time to time, but decided to register an account to ask this question. Should I buy a Tesla?

With my job I make around $85k per year (pretax), have kids, rent, and live in a very affordable part of the US. My wife has an ok paying part time job (she is also excited about the idea of a Tesla!). I'm a frugal guy and have managed to hoard up around $350k in savings in the past 4 years alone. We have no debt. The ICE car is paid off and any credit card spending is paid off immediately. My life is pretty good-I have no complaints!

We're not interested in buying a home. I think we have a decent savings nest egg, but we could always use more. Who couldn't?

Since I've done well with investments over the past few years I have been thinking of taking a chunk of that to buy the car of my dreams. A 60D with most of the options would be fine, but I really love the white interior. So I'd have to go with a MS90D for that. I reserved a Model 3, but I'm worried there will be delays and/or problems with early 3s. The S seems like the most solid choice right now, and it seems like it will be more of a sure thing when 3s start rolling out. The large size & hatch are big bonuses, too. The uncertainty of the 3 is the biggest reason I'd consider the more expensive S.

Please note that I'm not pulling hairs out over this decision (which would be difficult since I'm bald). If I have to wait then I'll wait. Like I said, I'm a frugal guy. I'd absolutely LOVE an MS tomorrow, but I'm ok waiting another 12-18 months. I'd just love to hear opinions from other people.

edit: After reading the comments I'm leaning towards waiting at least until Spring 2017 and making a decision then. I feel like I've already been waiting forever for a Tesla, but maybe it's not a bad idea to at least see the next Model 3 reveal first. I already feel like life is great, even if my current car is boring (but hey, it works!). I am 99% sure owning a Tesla will be an amazing experience. I love everything about the company and the car. Would it be so bad to give them a few months to show me what the Model 3 will be all about? If the price is right I might end up waiting and optioning out an M3XXDL. ;)",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/5fets0/do_you_think_i_should_buy_a_tesla/,affordabletesla,106.0,0.998
TeslaMotors,complaint,811a0u,Hot take on several hours with the Model 3....,"Hot takes from a few hours with the 3:  Many people don't know this, but I was scared I was going to drive the 3 for a little while, curse a lot, and resign myself to selling it and buying a P100D, even though I could have bought a Model S in 2012 instead of waiting this long.  ('Course, it wouldn't have been a P100D, but you get the idea). 

I thought there was a non-zero chance I would like the S so much better than the 3 with its quirks that I would have a lot of regret about waiting.  And I've been waiting for the 3 since it was codenamed ""Bluestar"" back in 2006, two years before the Roadster even hit the roads.

But this car... it turns out... was absolutely worth the wait.  Totally.  I mean, this thing is awesome, and this is coming from someone who was really trepidatious about it going into today.  Most of the complaints you've read in the press or on the boards don't really hold water.  I'm not saying they're made up, but you will get used to most everything so quickly it's a lot of non-issues.  And people who know me know, I complain.  A lot.  About everything.

For example, the center console magnet is as persnickety as prosumer grade magnetic speaker grills.  If you're used to them, you'll know exactly what I mean.

In fact, my biggest complaint:  Today I told someone, ""I was scared the phone key wasn't going to work, but it's been working perfectly,"" and on that particular occasion, when walking up to the car... as if on cue... it didn't.  Now the full disclosure on this is that I have a Google Pixel XL first gen, and they were notorious for bluetooth connectivity issues, which is why I was scared this could be an issue.  And sure enough, when it failed, the phone had disconnected itself from the 3.  Not the car's fault, but the phone's fault.  But now I think I have a faster fix for it than getting out the key card to open the car.

All in all... this thing is definitely worthy of being called a Tesla.  And despite the fact that I thought there were things about this car that make it sort of a ""Weird-mobile"" (not the exterior styling, mind you, but from a ""why-do-I-need-to-press-a-button-on-the-center-console-to-open-up-the-glove-box"" kind of way)-- I gotta say, spend a few hours with it and it all really starts to make more sense than any of the reviews out there would lead you to believe in print or on Youtube.     

TL;DR:  Car exceeded my tempered expectations.  I actually love this thing.  I was scared I wouldn't.  I was wrong.  I'd rate TSLA a strong by after an a day with the 3.

Oh PS:

W/R/T #alcantaragate.

I was wrong.  The new material is not quite the hard-woven stuff I thought it was.  It has a softer feel, almost like it might be woven with bamboo or something.  Much better than I thought it was going to be.  I still have a personal preference for alcantara, but I no longer will hate on Tesla for calling it a ""premium material.""

TeslaMotors,complaint,5csa6n,Tesla broken down with 20k miles on it,"Im on a road trip from san diego to tuscon for a family reunion. A few things which have been kind of a bummer so far.

1) drove here just fine without incidint. But the route planner in the car is lacking.  It got me to tuscon with only 40 miles of range left. I wasnt worried about it, i thought to my self no problem ill just hit the tuscon supercharger when i get there...

Turns out there is no supercharger in tuscon and the closest one is 60 miles away.  Do'h.

I didnt have enough range to even make it there forget about the extra 3 hours it would take me to get there and back.  I was like oh no problem, ill just get an extension cord and trickle charge it sonce i have the adaptor.  But what i didnt lnow is you need to bring the entire charging cable not just the adaptor. So i was unable to trickle charge either...

2) i called tesla and they directed me to a local level 2 charger (the 40 amp 220 v) version.  Charging time 10 hours. I dropped my car off in a chinese restrauant parking lot and uber back to my sister house and just left it there all day.  Came back to pick it up at midnight when it was finally charged. 

3) next day im driving in the 2nd leg of my trip from tuscon to pheonix to visit my brother and grandma.  This time i use evtripplanner and it directs me to the casa grande super charger there and on the way back.  All good.  When i get to the super charger, I plug the car and go eat some in-n-out when the car just about topped up we go out to the car. I unplug it and get in. The car starts tripping out saying it cant be driven and to contact service center. I call them and the car is in an unknown state.  They have me try and reboot the car and it will not boot back up.  After 20 minites the car finally came back up and has an additional message complaining about the 12v battery is dead.

After google the error it appears that the 12v battery goes out the entire car us completely unusable. 

4) so now Tesla is dispatching a towtruck from pheonix (2 hour wait) where we will get picked up, we will ride in the towtruck to tempe to drop the car off at the service center which is closed today and ill be given an uber to the rental car company to rent another car..

5) tonight i have to drive back to tuscon in the rental car and was supposed to leave back to san diego tomorrow morning. 

Not sure if im just stranded here or what at this point or how long its going to take to get the car out of the service center. 

Kinda been a rough trip so far.  I did a similar road trip from san diego to vegas and had none of these issues. A learning experience to be sure. 

--EDIT

Turned out to be a ""high voltage transfer switch"" or something like that.  I don't remember exactly what the tech said.  So it was the thing that was responsible for allowing the car to charge.  He said that the one in my car had known issues and that they were replacing it with a 2nd rev that fixes the issue.  They didn't have one in stock but overnighted it.  So I should be back on the road tomorrow afternoon.  It left me stranded in phoenix for an extra day, and ended up costing me a few hundred dollars in hotels and rentals cars but not the end of the world.  

I would still say that the tesla is the best car I have ever owned, and tesla was extremely good and following up and making sure my inconvenience was minimized.  My complaint about not having superchargers in every major city stands.  I know they are a new company, but I hope that they have plans to fix this.  Getting to a city and having to park your car in a chinese restrauant parkinglot for 10 hours is not ideal.  When I went to vegas, they did have supercharger there and it was great.  No issues at all.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/5csa6n/tesla_broken_down_with_20k_miles_on_it/,jhansen858,23122.0,0.9805
TeslaMotors,complaint,6wiib8,Our Tesla Experience - LONG!,"My husband ( /u/alexp2 ) and I decided to hire a Tesla Model S as a treat for our wedding anniversary, and I thought I'd share our experience here as it was our first time with a Tesla.

As a bit of background, we are big Tesla fans but until recently didn't have anywhere to charge an EV.  As we now live in a house with driveway we plan for an EV to be our next car, and have a Model 3 reservation.  We decided to hire a Model S to experience EV driving and see if the Model S might be a nice fit for us instead.

We hired the car (a post-factlift 90D with AP1) from a company called [Whitecar](https://white.car) and had the car from Tuesday into Wednesday, which was a one-day (24hr) rental.  The manager at Whitecar offered to extend our trip in the morning, so we had the car for a little over 24 hours.

**Our Route**

We planned the route in advance to maximise driving time on different roads.  We left Whitecar in Edinburgh and travelled to down the A68 to Newcastle for lunch, then along the A69 to join the M6 for our return journey to Scotland.  That evening we travelled up to Dundee with a friend to let her experience a ride the car before coming home.  The following day we stayed local and let our parents experience the Tesla.

**First Impressions**

Nothing can describe the eerie feeling of silently pulling off in an EV for the first time.  It's incredible.  Swearing followed by euphoric giggling is the general sound of putting your foot down for the first time in a Tesla Model S, something we experienced personally and then with every passenger we took for a spin.

The car was comfortable and very well thought out.  We're big tech fans and always like to option the gadgets in our cars.  The Model S has plenty of them - the only things that are missing from our current car are ventilated seats and 360¬∫ top-down cameras.  This would have come in very handy when parking this behemoth in the woefully inadequate spaces at the Metrocentre in Newcastle - I know about Autopark, but with a stream of traffic behind me I couldn't get the icon to appear.

The voice control worked flawlessly for calling and navigation.  Locations that our own car (2016 Kia Optima 3) simply doesn't know about were found effortlessly by voice.  Having multiple driver profiles is excellent, especially as they include mirrors and steering wheel position (our Optima only controls the seat, and is limited to two profiles).

I love that my phone connected so quickly to Bluetooth, and that the car remembered that I was listening to BT rather than the radio.  On my Optima it defaults to radio every time you turn the car on.  The Tesla started music as soon as I opened the door, which felt like magic!  Having the music continue once the car is in park, and lower the volume when you open the door, is a very nice touch.

Being able to sit in the car with the AC on and not look like a dick is a huge benefit, along with the pre-cooling.  I hate sitting in my own car while waiting on someone and boiling as I don't want to sit in a car park with a big dirty diesel engine running.

**Charging / Range anxiety**

With the 90D charged to 90% when we picked it up, we were able to drive to Newcastle and then on to the supercharger at Gretna services with 16% remaining in the battery.  That was a total distance of 176 miles, but I'd be lying if I said I was driving optimally...

At Gretna we charged for a while while having a coffee, then continued to Abington supercharger where we had dinner and charged back up to 90%.  This gave us plenty of range to the Dundee supercharger via our friend's flat.  We had a coffee and some nibbles at the Hilton in Dundee (with a 10% Tesla discount) and then headed home to Falkirk.

We did charge at home using a standard wall socket, and this gave us around 20% range in 7 hours.  Faster than I expected.

Because we didn't have a charger at home I was more anxious to keep the car charged as much as possible, though of course when we own a car this anxiety will disappear as we'll easily charge overnight.  It certainly didn't feel like a chore, and we never had an issue getting a charge.  In fact we only saw one other car the whole day at a Supercharger.

**Autopilot**

This worked very well on motorways, and was outstanding in slow start-stop traffic around the Edinburgh City Bypass.  Our Optima has radar cruise control and lane keep assist.  The lane keep assist is basically useless, and the radar cruise control is markedly worse than that of AP.

In start-stop traffic, our own car will come to a stop quite abruptly, then when traffic moves away ahead it will roar off to catch up, then slam on the brakes again.  It works, but lacks any refinement to the point that I don't use it for fear of pissing off people behind me.

In contrast, AP worked smoothly and subtly, seeming to anticipate what had to happen like a real driver would.  Excellent!

On motorways it worked flawlessly too - no complaints at all.  Even on well-marked A-roads it was good, though I didn't try it on the roads that were twisty.

I did eventually manage to try Autopark in a quiet little car park.  It seemed slow to find the spaces, but it did park well.  I'm not sure how useful it would be in real life as in a busy car park I don't think I'd have time to let it figure out where the spaces are.  It felt like driving past them the icon would appear briefly and then go away again.  Frustrating, but I've heard Autopark in AP2 is better?

**The bad bits**

The car we hired had a sunroof and this had an annoying rattle while driving.  A few interior panels were a bit misaligned and wobbly, indicating substandard build-quality even compared to our Optima.  The chrome trim at the bottom of the front and rear door windows didn't line up either.

Navigation appears to be standard in-car navigation masquerading as Google Maps.  The maps look like Google, but the navigation information definitely is not, and doesn't appear to be much better than our own car.  It must use Google POI search, however, as this is excellent.

The map also had incorrect supercharger usage information.  Every single time it told us there were more people charging than there were.  At Dundee it says 4/8 bays were free, but nobody was there at all.  At Edinburgh it said both bays were in use, but one of them was free.

Storage in the rear was a big problem.  I don't even care much for proper storage, but there weren't even cupholders!  What the hell?

**Kerb-appeal**

I've never driven a car before that turns heads as much as this.  We saw not-so-subtle glances from other drivers, as well as a couple of groups of teens who got super excited, pointing and jumping around when we drove by.  That was unexpected, but kind of cool!  I also enjoyed the camaraderie when another Model S driver gave me a friendly flash when he passed in the opposite direction... though I felt like a complete fraud!

**Conclusions**

We need one of these damn cars!  Our lease isn't up until 2019, but at that point we will be looking at a Tesla for sure.  We have a Model 3 reservation, but I think we're going to stretch to a Model S if we can - I've already got my eye on a 75D with blue paint, cream interior, and EAP.  If we go for a Model 3 it'll be the long range version with PUP, EAP and red paint.

Sorry for the long post, but we had a wonderful couple of days and I just had to share it.  Happy to answer any questions from non-owners or clarify any aspects of our experience.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/6wiib8/our_tesla_experience_long/,dst87,20378.0,0.9951
TeslaMotors,complaint,9yoyeo,First Tesla and disappointed,"Picked up a long range dual motor model 3 over the weekend and it‚Äôs a great car but I‚Äôm disappointed.  No complaints about the car itself but I bought it with the understanding it has a range of 310 miles.  Seems we should use and maintain the car daily by keeping it between 20 and 80% or the batteries will be damaged over time.   Hence the reason why Tesla delivers cars with 80% charge?  0-100% is supposed to be limited to long trips.  The Tesla website doesn‚Äôt mention this.   Doing the math I should self limit myself to 190 miles of range or pony up $15k for a new battery pack in a few years.   

Any owners charging to 100% daily?   I charged my Chevy Volt to 100% everyday and never had issues.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9yoyeo/first_tesla_and_disappointed/,brobert123,55274.0,-0.8163

TeslaMotors,complaint,9khtjw,Delivery Hell - Limbo pt2,"My delivery saga continues.  

Recap:  
2017 Reservation

Jun 29th: Ordered the car

Jul - August: Sent an e-mail about once a week to ask about status with no response.

Sep 1st: Called Tesla to ask what was going on, was told they would get back to me.

Sep 1st: Fist contact from my Sales Advisor.  He schedules delivery for ""next weekend"".  My delivery date shows midnight on Friday the 7th.

Sep 8th:  Call the delivery center to ask about the status, they say they don't know and that I need to talk to my Sales Agent.

Sep 10th: Finally reach my sales agent after repeated calls without answer (and his voicemail is full).  He then updates the date for NEXT weekend. 

This repeats throughout the month of September.  

&#x200B;

At each call I repeatedly informed my Sales Agent that I would be out of town for a conference from the 24th-28th.  At each call he confirms for me that those dates are ""blacked out"". 

&#x200B;

9/24:  While at the conference I get a call from a trucking company, they apparently have my car and are planning to deliver it to my house tomorrow (9/25). 

&#x200B;

I informed them at this time that no one was home, and my Sales Agent said he was going to either leave the car in my driveway with the keys in it, or he was going to delay my delivery until late October.   He claimed that I never asked for the blackout dates, and that those were my ONLY options accordingly.

&#x200B;

I find this level of service just utterly unacceptable.  Right now my account shows a delivery date of ""Late September"".  When I call in and ask they say that my delivery date is still scheduled for 9/22!?!? and I still cannot get an answer as to what is going on with my car.  

&#x200B;

Even worse, since the Sales Agent required payment in full prior to delivery I've now started making loan payments on a car that I don't own, and haven't even seen.  

&#x200B;

I might love Tesla conceptually, and I know I'll love my car when I get it.  But this is such a bad experience that I'm recommending my co-workers not buy a Tesla, to wait and see if they can fix their delivery challenges.  This is NOT the word of mouth I want to be spreading (lots of my coworkers were potential customers until this).  But it's all I can say at this point. 

&#x200B;

(And yes I've called the Sales numbers, the Delivery Center, my ISA/DSA, all to no real avail).

As much as I want Tesla to succeed... This is unacceptable... Although they seem to have ironed out most kinks with the Model 3, I am still holding back on purchasing due to quality control and service complaints...

Tesla is now the most valuable automaker by market capitilization and hopefully respond accordingly... No other car manufacturer would get a pass on these issues

**Edit:** I am not trying to ""hate"" on Tesla, I am  ^(this)  close to ordering a M3P and have the Cybertruck pre-ordered, but it seems as if they didn't learn anything from the initial Model 3 release and the same mistakes are being made with the Model Y...

TeslaMotors,complaint,cvns1i,Model 3 test-drive first impressions,"A new service center opened up in my area and they started doing test drives so I signed up for one.  My lease on my Acura is up in a month and the M3 LR-AWD is on my short list for my next car.  Having a service center in my town is great, as I would previously have to drive an hour to King of Prussia, PA.

First off, the experience at the shop was great.  It was one guy, who i guess is heading up this new office.  He blocked off an hour for me, gave me a tour of the shop, and let me spend like 45 minutes in the car itself.  So this itself was a winner for tesla, as I've never had such personal attention at any car dealership before.

Once we got driving, I was immediately impressed.  Like others, I've watched hundreds of Tesla videos online, but I hadn't driven one myself.  The acceleration on this thing is just bonkers.  I think Joe Rogan put it the best when he said ""it feels like you're in alien technology pushing through a wormhole"".  Just absolutely wild and you can't help but smile.There is a ton of tech in the car, but if you're good with tech already you'll pick up on this stuff really quickly.

One the thing that I was surprised by was the sheer weight of the car.  In pictures and videos, the car looks small and light.  Though when you're driving it, it's very heavily weighted to the ground (i assume from the battery) and the steering is tight so you really feel like you're driving something with some weight to it (which is good).  The actual driving dynamics of the car were so much better than i expected.

We tried auto-pilot on the highway which was incredible.  Again i've seen countless videos but experiencing it is wild. Just feels like the future. Though i wish so many of the cool features were locked behind the FSD package (lane changing while on autopilot, etc).

Sound system was top-tier, the surround sound feature was cool (though it makes certain music genres sound weird. If you have a pair of gaming headphones with that artificial surround sound you'll know what I mean).  My one complaint about the audio was that you can't get SiriusXM in a Tesla.  He showed me the built-in Pandora-like system but it was having trouble loading and seemed less than ideal.

Overall, was a fantastic experience. and driving my own car home really sucked.  Tesla's really do make other cars feel dumb.

TeslaMotors,complaint,9ofw5a,Update: From modified Subaru STi to P3D+,"A while back I posted outlining my worries transitioning from a fairly modified sports hatch (2012 Subaru STi) to a model 3 (original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/8uxw7k/upgrading_to_a_model_3_will_be_a_performance/). At the time I had configured an AWD model 3 but I eventually convinced myself to upgrade to a performance model with the upgrade package. Even though some of the concerns I had don't apply to my P3D+, I thought I would still share my impressions.

As I outlined in my post a while back, my Subaru was what I would consider lightly tuned for power and heavily modified for handling. Mods included a stage 2 pro-tune producing 307 whp and 337 wtq, fully upgraded suspension including ohlins road and track coilovers, upgraded sways, linkages/braces, etc. For reference, all told I probably dumped >$20k into a car that I purchased new for just under $40k. 

I absolutely loved my Subaru. It was a blast to drive, especially on tight twisty roads. One particular reason why I enjoyed that car so much didn't necessarily have to do with the car itself, but rather geography. My first few years of ownership took place along the coast of central California. Rarely having to deal with traffic and the abundance of fun backroads in my immediate vicinity made enjoying a relatively high power car with good handling characteristics and a manual gearbox a blast to own. When I moved to the SF bay area the car became a little less practical, but my vicinity to good driving roads meant it still got driven as intended on a regular basis. After another few years I moved to an even higher density area where having a manual gearbox became more of a chore than it needed to be, and a lack of any real space to open it up became apparent. This all happened to coincide with my desire to switch to an EV, especially warranted by the cheap clean electricity available in the Pacific Northwest. Additionally, I am no longer in my mid-20s. A loud, rattly subaru was starting to wear on me a little bit and wasn't really ""who I was"" any longer.

I have been a supporting shareholder of Tesla for a long time (think I bought my first $TSLA shares in 2014) and was really impressed with the design of the model 3 from the beginning. I had a reservation long before, but once the AWD was announced I started seriously shopping around configurations. After a bit of back-and-forth, and deciding to sell some stock to support that decision, I decided to make the same call I did when weighing the decision between a WRX and an STi - get the high performance version so you don't regret it every time you see one in the wild.

The car was delivered a month ago and I have since put about 700 miles on it. The delivery was overall smooth. I did have a 3 day delay while they replaced the heater core which was flagged during their pre-delivery inspection. At the time I was a little disappointed, especially at the fact that I was not notified until 16 hours before my delivery appointment, but Tesla has been busy and, in the end, I'm glad they addressed the issue upfront. Upon delivery, the car, including paint, was in great shape. Only issue was a gash in the rocker panel under the driver side kick-panel from transporting the car. I have an appointment to have that remedied, but no rush since it's not visible. Overall the car is absolutely amazing and i couldn't be happier with the change.

This is turning into a really long-winded post so I'll break down my main points of comparison below:

- The acceleration in the P3D+ is just silly. My subaru was fast, but required skill to jump off the line and was just not as quick no matter what. I have had a limited opportunities to test the high end, but from what I can tell the tesla starts to lose steam above 80 mph, where the subaru still pulled strong. The instant torque in the tesla might actually be tricking my senses though, as it could just be an artifact of not having to build boost to make power. I'd say that 99% of the time the tesla's low end torque and acceleration make it more fun to drive than the infrequent occasion in which I am able to really hit high speeds. Every person who has been in the car has commented on how acceleration is like nothing they have experienced before. My partner hates it :)

- The cornering performance delta between the tesla and my subaru is pretty much as expected: handling is a little ""sloppier"" in the P3D+, but is much more comfortable. I especially feel the weight of the car in corners, where I notice significant body roll. That said, I don't feel the need to change anything based on my current driving habits. I love not getting jostled around as I drive back and forth to work - I'm sure my kidneys appreciate it as well.

- The interior is (no surpise) a huge upgrade. I love the spartan layout and having everything on the center screen was very easy to adapt to. It is zen quiet, the glass roof makes it feel open and spacious, and the sound system is the best I have personally experienced in a car. Only major complaint is with controlling the windshield wipers. It still feels cumbersome to change settings, a point exacerbated by the fact that this only becomes apparent at times when concentration should be focused solely on the road rather than the screen. I have not tried the autowipers in V9 yet, but in V8.1 they were unreliable/inaccurate in heavy rain. Some minor knit-picks: rear-view visibility sucks (especially compared to the hatchback in my subaru), the material used on the headliner feels cheap and I worry about stains, the backseat legroom is a bit cramped (especially behind my drivers seat which I find most comfortable when positioned as far back as it will go), and the extension of the door arm rest on the b-pillar is literally the only contact point made of hard plastic (otherwise, I love the abundance of soft-touch materials used throughout).

- Exterior: love it, looks great, white cars are hard to keep clean. Not much to report here - car design is a matter of personal aesthetic taste. I happen to love the look of the car, especially from the front. I think the 20-inch wheels and big brakes really spice up the profile of a car that otherwise looks a bit plain. Not the biggest fan of the chrome trim but not sure if it would look any better blacked out. Two issues I have with the exterior, 1) the frunk is an absolute pain in the ass to use. I feel like I am damaging the hood every time I close it (yes, I am doing it right). I find myself not using it simply because I don't want bystanders to assume I am punishing my car for doing something wrong, and 2) the side mirrors, specifically the driver's side, does not adjust far enough, limiting my ability to properly cover my blindspots. Not really an exterior comment, but I don't know where else this fits: why the hell they thought selling a car with Michelin 4S tires in an area that will see snow in less than 2 months is absurd. I don't need tires for heavy snow duty, but the 4S that come with the car are  not recommended to be loaded when temperatures reach 40 degrees Fahrenheit - that's right, Michelin warns about even having the tires on the ground when temperature gets close to freezing as it can cause permanent damage to the tire. I have a set of Michelin Pilot A/S 3+ on the way. I guess its a good excuse to put 255s on the car.

I wrote this post as a critique, not meant to echo the plentiful, well-deserved praises the car has already received. But, in my experience, those praises far outweigh the critiques I made above. The car is hands-down the most well-rounded car I have ever driven and is perfectly suited as a daily-driver that still allows for some fun when the roads clear up. Here's to Tesla continuing to make the best cars available, electric or not.

tl;dr The P3D+ is far more amenable to my current lifestyle, and outright better in nearly every aspect, than my outgoing Subaru. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9ofw5a/update_from_modified_subaru_sti_to_p3d/,monsieurpeanutman,16756.0,0.9994
TeslaMotors,complaint,s0lp1m,FSD Beta 10.8.1 Write up,"2019 Model 3 w/ AP 2.5 cameras.

My Model X hasn't gotten 10.8.1 yet, which I think is going to be the norm because Tesla is programming for horizontal screens before vertical ones.

Two routes were driven on Jan 9th, 2022.  The first one was [this one here](https://imgur.com/4RE9DwV)

[This turn here](https://imgur.com/wAL2EMk), which my Model X previously lined me up for a curbing, was handled properly with no issues on the Model 3.

[This intersection here](https://imgur.com/d9OCKmm) the car handles more confidently now.  This is an intersection which goes from two lanes south of the train tracks to 3 lanes north of the tracks.  The Model X used to have a lot of debate over which of the two left lanes it should get into, while Model 3 confidently went straight into the left most lane.  It then had to make two lane changes into the right most lane.

[There's new blinky yellow lights](https://imgur.com/qGaWmGB) which the car still pumps the brakes for.  Blinky yellows are the bane of my existence at the moment as the cars are constantly pumping brakes for them.

Manual intervention was required at [this on ramp](https://imgur.com/sNtnHKm), where manual intervention was not required before.  As it crosses the intersection the vehicle becomes *super* uncertain about whether or not it should be in the lane its in to try and get on the interstate.  This has worked, and not worked, repeatedly over the versions.

Getting off of Interstate 4 was weird.  I got off the interstate at [this offramp here](https://imgur.com/ElID9Br), where [this white car](https://youtu.be/7i8n1Ouy3sA) either wasn't paying attention, or got impatient, and did a fake sideswipe attempt?  Honestly not sure, it was weird.  Occurred at the yellow line.  Further up the on ramp we see a black line.  This is when I accidentally disengaged FSD and didn't realize it.  Or somewhere after that point.  The car was taking, to me, a *long* time to take the turn and was likely going to miss the green light to proceed, so I hit the accelerator to get it to go, and I guess I had too much torque on the wheel and it just slightly disengaged?  Honestly not 100% certain on the sequence of events.  [I was then distracted by the dude at the side of the road pulling golf clubs out the back of his vehicle](https://youtu.be/hTh3_-eSZCU).  Wife fussed at me, and I realized FSD was disengaged and engaged it again.

A note regarding the above.  This was my first time driving FSD Beta in the Model 3.  Prior to this it's always been in my Model X.  The Model X has a big ass blue wheel in the lower right corner of the instrumentation panel, so it's super easy to tell when FSD/AP is disengaged.  v11 on the Model 3 has reduced it to a footnote like icon where if you don't hear the single tone chime, it's not quite as obvious that AP/FSD is disengaged.

[The next intersection](https://imgur.com/vYTyWtm) was handled very well as well.  [The vehicle got into the turn lane, waited its turn, then went](https://youtu.be/Q9GG9kmnHLo).  The vehicle then got into the left lane, which while initially annoyed because it always favors the left lane, ended up being the right choice because the right lane turned into a ""turn only"" lane, so another example of FSD helping out someone drive around an area they were unfamiliar with.

Once destination was reached we turned around and drove back the way with came, more or less.  Note that from this point I am now doing FSD while eating fries from Five Guys.

We went back through [this intersection](https://imgur.com/LrZWqBS) and the vehicle handled it fine, and south we went.

[This S-curve, of sorts](https://imgur.com/603LB0A) was handled very well, and properly, while eating my fries.

[At this intersection](https://imgur.com/YFVqMBY) I honestly don't remember if I was in the left or right turn lane.  I want to say the left one.  The car took the turn just fine either way, no disengagement.  Was almost done with my fries.

[This intersection is one I've been meaning to drive through for a while](https://www.google.com/maps/@28.0385424,-81.9409705,3a,75y,118.18h,84.77t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s8AAy2yUScLrtqplrDr-VWg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3D8AAy2yUScLrtqplrDr-VWg%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D61.139606%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192) because the way the lights are strung up across the intersection the red lights for cross traffic is visible.  The car handled it fine with no issues, just kept going straight through.

[This right turn](https://imgur.com/uA3mBum), which should be a slam dunk, was not handled well at all.  As we approached the turn the car failed to get into the right lane in time, requiring me to make two manual lane changes to the right.  Once in the right lane the car never entered the right turn lane, I had to manually get it into the turn lane where the yellow mark is.  Once in the turn lane the vehicle tried to take the turn at like 30-40mph, might not have been that high, but the point is that it didn't brake hard enough for the turn.  This has been an issue for as long as I can remember at this turn when having done it a couple times with the X.  I finished eating my fries prior to getting to this turn.

[The very next turn, here](https://imgur.com/mMFzKE0), by comparison, was handled excruciatingly slowly, like the logic in the car was like ""Sorry, my bad, I took that last one too fast.  Let me take this one slower"" like some passive aggressive driver overreacting to your earlier complaint of ""Holy shit, that was a little fast man"".

At [this intersection here](https://imgur.com/d8AtI7p) the car was supposed to follow the red arrow, but it instead tried to do the yellow arrow, required manual intervention.

[Thus turn here](https://imgur.com/NanyGBv) was handled properly.  My wife wanted me to handle it manually because the turn it a pretty blind one, but the car did it at a reasonable speed.  I was pleased, my wife was tense.

[This right turn](https://imgur.com/emDxqVn) was also handled quite comfortably, better than the red arrow I drew.

[This left turn here](https://imgur.com/Qwf14Ki) was handled quite comfortable.  I was a little concerned at first, but in the end it made the arc successfully, and without a ""close call"" for almost hitting the curb.

[This intersection here](https://imgur.com/PitBgWX) I normally have issues with, however, it was handled properly this time.  I suspect the main reason for that is because I had a [lead car](https://youtu.be/44awgvOQvps).

[The very next intersection](https://imgur.com/SJZgYgJ) proved to be a little trick for [FSD as it crawled its way through the intersection](https://youtu.be/BsEpyx4cslM).  I ultimately had to hold the accelerator pedal down to get it to finally go because it was just crawling forward so slowly.  If I had to guess the issue here is the road's geometry.  The oncoming traffic probably hits where the seam is between the two cameras, so it isn't comfortable with the maneuver.

Similar thing at [this intersection](https://imgur.com/Rih0C7H), should be a pretty straight forward non-stop straight through, [but the vehicle tries to come to a stop rather than keep going](https://youtu.be/1raRDaJM9IQ), I ultimately have to press down on the accelerator to get it to keep going.

[This left turn](https://imgur.com/yjYb692) was a pretty [textbook left turn](https://youtu.be/2TusU3AcV84) with no issues.

[The next intersection](https://imgur.com/QNXvKWQ) should also be an easy right turn, but the system fails at it.  [I would have let it fail, however, I had a car behind me, so when I noticed it wasn't slowing in time I took direct control](https://youtu.be/zDaxRYzLZz0).  This turned used to be handled fine, however, starting around 10.6 it began failing to take this turn in the X.  I've got two right turns that should be ""slam dunks"" but instead it just chokes.

[The next left turn](https://imgur.com/ik3DYWg) was another [beautiful left turn](https://youtu.be/0tRLJ3DbWiA).

[This turn](https://imgur.com/uCGAn9a) was a little concerning.  It took the turn at a pretty high rate of speed.  The main reason I find it concerning is because as the car passed over the train tracks the car ""slid"" about a foot or so to the left, causing me to slightly enter the oncoming traffic lane.  Not by a lot, but in the rain I could see the car sliding further, if not just spinning out altogether.

The next drive was this one here: https://imgur.com/UIadWZw

Largely uneventful.  [This merge point](https://imgur.com/2l9Gysw) was handled well

[This intersection here](https://imgur.com/cRL8HlZ) was handled with no interventions, which is a first for FSD for me.

[This left turn](https://imgur.com/shJdxsR) was a problem again.  I had to hold down the accelerator through the turn to finally get it to go.

[This curve in the road](https://imgur.com/6vDsy8W) was handled well.  The road was recently resurfaced, so the lane markers aren't there, just little yellow dots to denote lanes, and the car handled the turn comfortably.

[This left turn](https://imgur.com/5kpgTwB) could've been handled better.  The car tends to stop at the stop sign, which is where the yellow line is, then it takes *forever* to creep forward into a position to see cross traffic.  I ended up having to hold down the accelerator to get it to go as there was traffic behind us.

[This is like the biggest frigging mansion I've ever seen](https://www.google.com/maps/@27.8213529,-82.2100779,3a,75y,146.15h,88.12t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sK4g4kMbwFfDcl5JyuN483Q!2e0!7i16384!8i8192)

[This curve](https://imgur.com/q9vRYuC) was *not* handled well.  Car should've done the red arrow, but did the yellow arrow instead, crossing me into oncoming traffic.

[This roundabout](https://imgur.com/YeIrXXz) was poorly handled.  The car stops where the yellow line is.  There was no traffic in the roundabout, but it keeps treating the ""yield"" signs as stop signs, which in Florida will get me rear ended.

Going back followed the same roads, and going in the opposite direction I encountered no issues with the car driving itself, with the exception of [this spot here](https://imgur.com/gXoGjgv) where the vehicle tried to take the wrong turn to go right.  This issue in particular is starting to annoy me because it's been there since 10.2.  So it's been there for like 4 months now.

As a whole I'm becoming way more comfortable with the system, it requires far less babysitting than before, but that some areas which presented me no issues before are now presenting issues is a bit concerning, and a reminder to always be paying attention to how the system behaves, and that each version should be tested anew until you've put it through its paces.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/s0lp1m/fsd_beta_1081_write_up/,Nakatomi2010,260413.0,0.893
TeslaMotors,complaint,cazavz,Distressing lack of delivery clarity for UK RHD,"Hey all,

Sorry to bust into Reddit with a whine thread but there are those of us who feel like we have to reach higher than the delivery contact centre to tell our stories, as the details are pretty staggering.

There are a few key points to this tale, which I'll try and cover as it makes sense when you see the series of events that have led us here.

Orders went live for model 3 in the UK on the 1st of May. I eagerly converted my reservation, not least of which because I wanted FSD and the price was about to go up. Ordered an all wheel drive long range with 18"" aeros. Grey. What a beauty. End of June deliveries begin the site advertised.

This is my first foray into premium sedan territory, but I've bought a couple of new 20-30k cars so I had some expectations about the experience, mainly that with a high margin vehicle like this it surely had to be better than all that.

The first few minor blows to that expectation came quite quickly when we were told to select our delivery location, and only the major Tesla centres were an option. No big deal, I thought, as I imagined the logistical challenges faced with delivering what was now rumoured to me 5000 back orders. I had a choice of two, equidistant centres so I picked the one I thought might be easier to travel to. This is pretty much early June.

You also put in your trade in requests now, as well as your finance applications etc. This gave me cause over the next few weeks to make a few calls to Tesla to arrange and sort out the details. Firstly with the trade in. The undervaluation of my Prius was staggering, so much so that they actually offered me 1k less than the finance I still owed on it, an 18 month old car that had held its value very well being a plug in hybrid. I queried this, assuming they might have the wrong model or something, but was told in short that Tesla just didn't want to do trade ins. They don't look to make money back on the cars they take in, and they were not able to explain why the offer for mine was so low ball.

No big deal I thought, sure. I'll sell it myself. Getting back nearly 7k equity in my current car was a big part of making sure I had the deposit for the new one by the end of June, which I queried on each contact with Tesla and was assured that was still the information they had. Deliveries would start at the end of June and as a reservation holder and early order, mine would be among the first to be delivered. However, I was warned, read the delivery t&cs because there is a bit in there about delivery and the fact that you only have 5 days to pick your car up once you are given a collection date. Otherwise the car can be assigned to someone else. I ask about this and explain that fit the purchase to make any financial sense I'll have to sell my car privately, and that can take an indeterminate amount of time. When pressed about delivery of my M3 I was again assured that, while nobody could give me anything solid, there was no reason to believe the end of June would slip as an expectant delivery timescale.

So I list my car for sale. I sell it privately and release the equity pretty easily after a brief spell on an auto website. Just a short wait left for my car.

The news arrives that the first batch have indeed arrived, though we are short on details. Piecing it together from stuff on Twitter, Facebook groups and YouTube, they are all performance models with white interior, and all delivered to a single delivery outlet in London.

Strange I thought, though I suppose getting those high margin cars out and done makes sense for the big end of quarter push were hearing about. No big deal. But it's the end of June now and I've had no car for two weeks already. There is a reason most companies give you reasonable trade in values so you can swap your car with your new one, and it's too avoid both the hassle of selling privately as well as convenience of swapping old for new.

Oh well. Early July wont be that bad. But it's still late so I again call Tesla to register my situation. I lay it all out, my car is sold as per previous discussions so I am now at a loose end waiting for my Tesla. I'm passed on to a guy who calls me from his mobile and tells me he's a UK delivery manager. No AWD LRs have been delivered yet at all, so that's why you don't have your car. He says he's going to get the details on the next shipment from the us and try to determine if mine is on board. 

I find this a strange and confusing situation already. How can such a logistical task take place without any idea from manufacture to delivery? Surely the cars are made to order or something, as there are so many different combinations of colour, wheels and model that to deliver any cars at all and honour the reservation holders promise of first delivery seems impossible unless you're actually making the cars they've now ordered first.

Another week of no news, I chase this guy up a couple of times, no news. Suddenly he stops returning my calls. His phone is off.

I call the main Tesla number again, and it's around this time you start to piece together the full story from Twitter and so on. There is no further delivery. Around 500 cars have made it to the UK and there are claims that these have been given to non reservation holders. Digging deeper you find that there are thousands of registered RHD VINs, but they are sat in an SF harbor waiting to be loaded and delivered. The ship journey alone takes 21 days, so the full impact of how late this could get is starting to become clear.

The main Tesla call centre is now a 45-60 minute wait on hold, not a good sign either. When i do speak to someone I am aghast at the attitude now coming back. I'm told that nobody is being given an estimate any more, once you have a VIN allocated you'll be given a delivery date. Until then you just wait.

Finding this very short on apologies and long on attitude, I log a formal complaint not only about the lateness of the car, but the total radio silence, and the fact that I've had to piece together the full story myself from social media. Surely Tesla must have known in may that they were not going to able to deliver cars in any significant numbers before July? And even worse, here we are in the first week of July and the RHD cars in SF are still there, or have been sent to some other RHD territories according to some reports. This means that July is pretty much out of the window now too, so without even a word from Tesla I'm now looking at a August or later delivery.

Social media is full of people who've found themselves in the same boat as myself. Pressured into getting ready for an end of June delivery, only to find that estimate to be either a severe miscalculation, or an down right lie.

Worse is the attitude from Tesla, that there is nothing to be done, nobody can give you any assurances or estimates. Nobody can give you any idea when you might actually be assigned a VIN or how the manufacturing process actually works in terms of getting the cars made to order for the early adopters, and on a boat to Europe. The whole reservation process where is as customers have helped crowd fund the company and car seems to mean nothing.

Wait or cancel. That is basically what you're left.

Personally I've found that it had blunted my excitement for the model 3 enough that I've been looking at some other luxury sedans and considering my options, I may actually take the plunge and just give up on this idea of the model 3 not least of which because I'm afraid this experience will be an indication of Tesla's ability to offer support and service in the UK in future. The people you speak to who work for Tesla simply hide behind the fact that the US based corporate isn't telling them anything. Not a good basis for an ongoing future relationship should you need parts, repair or service in future.

Worse is the fact that they seem unwilling to even acknowledge thier failure.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/cazavz/distressing_lack_of_delivery_clarity_for_uk_rhd/,Jonnehdk,9643.0,0.9914
TeslaMotors,complaint,5mi74r,My first month with my P100D,"I've had my new P100D for a month now and I figured after driving it for a while, I'd give my first impressions. To begin with, I have never enjoyed driving a car as much as this one. I absolutely love it. It combines the excitement of driving a sports car with the comfort of a luxury sedan. I legitimately don't mind running errands. 

I think that's mostly just it being a Tesla Model S though. In regards to the P100D specifically, the power is actually incredible. There are, of course, two parts to that. The practical side is that passing on the highway has never felt easier or safer and that's a huge relief. The fun side, with ludicrous mode on, is just unbelievable. We have had: an 1100+ hp Supra, an 800+ hp supercharged Viper and an 800+ hp turbocharged Corvette Z06 and this is by far the best ""go fast"" experience. Someone I gave a ride to put it perfectly by saying ""there's just no drama."" The car simply goes and does so really, really quickly. You don't feel like you have to fight the car for control each time in order to keep it pointed in the right direction while you accelerate at 100%. It really just feels like taking off in a roller coaster and after this experience I don't have any desire to go back to the alternative.

So yeah, it's definitely my favorite car I've ever owned, but that's not to say there aren't things that I think could be improved:

* The interior - I guess many people have a problem with it being too basic or minimalist. It actually fits me perfectly, I don't have any problem with it and was not at all disappointed. The lack of anything to hang clothes hangers on in the back seats is a bit missed. Also, the visor mirrors not having lights is not a complaint I'd personally include, but if my fiancee found out that I didn't mention it then I'd probably get into trouble, so there's that as well.

* The trunk really needs more/better lights. Probably something that comes from the sides, under the privacy cover would be perfect, as that's typically where it's hardest to see.

* 90% of the time, plugging in or removing the plug is painless. Occasionally, instead of it going white immediately after pressing the button when trying to remove the plug, there are a couple seconds of hesitation after which it may or may not go white for a split second and you try your best to remove it in the appropriate window. I call this ""the dance."" Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. I'm not sure if it's actually bad when I lose the dance (which sometimes involves pulling the charging plug out with the light blue as it was white a quarter of a second before), but I feel like this whole exchange really could be perfected.

* Navigation is sometimes a bit special. It sometimes gives routes which are much slower. The main example of this is my friend lives less than 10 minutes away from me but in the middle of a subdivision that's an absolute maze to get through so I use the navigation to get to his house. The navigation has me turn into the subdivison off of a main road much sooner than I should - taking the main road is much faster as the speed is faster on the main round and the route is more direct. The navigation also had us taking back roads parallel to the interstate on a return trip home recently. The interstate was easy to access, there was no traffic, we had plenty of battery, yet it insisted on us going significantly slower for about 1/3 of the trip. There are other smaller examples but these are the ones that I remember the most.

* The music player, the browser, etc. I won't go over these much, they've already been discussed at length and it's pretty much all accurate. One small thing I'm not sure have been mentioned though - when giving voice commands to play music, it would be nice to be able to have it play music from a USB, or for it to give priority to a USB source over streaming.

* The headlights. They do not produce a lot of light. We use the fog lights at all time otherwise the visibility provided by the lights isn't that great when driving country roads. The brights actually don't help much either. They're actually the biggest difference I notice. I would say that the normal headlights are around 80% of the brightness I'd normally expect and the brights are around 50% of the brightness I'd normally expect. In fact, I barely feel that the brights provide more illumination than just the normal headlights with the fog lights.

Bugs: I haven't had many bugs, just a few, but might as well mention them.

* One day when pulling the car out of the garage we had the power steering go out. We left the car alone for a couple minutes, went back to it and it was fine. 

* One day the touch screen wouldn't recognize any inputs. I could still control the music and the temperature with the wheel but I couldn't do anything with the screen. Eventually, I stopped being able to even control the music or the temperature with the wheel inputs, the temperature started going crazy (jumping back and forth from HI and off) and when I tried to give a voice command the car told me it was going to drive us off a cliff. Kidding about the last part, but actually after the temperature and everything went crazy for a bit the touchscreen rebooted itself and everything worked fine afterwards.

* One day the navigation believed we were driving in the middle of buildings rather than on the street for about 30 minutes before eventually figuring out exactly where we were. We didn't have bad reception or anything at the time for anything else.

* Initially, the auto-closing of the garage door only worked for one of the two profiles on the car. When the other profile was used, it would auto-open when returning home but wouldn't auto-close. Eventually it just started working and there hasn't been a problem since then.

Overall, if I were going to give the car a grade, I'd probably give about a 95/100. It's definitely the best car I've ever driven, but it's just a few small details away from perfection.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/5mi74r/my_first_month_with_my_p100d/,Gripeaway,51411.0,0.9973
TeslaMotors,complaint,jyis6s,"So, I bought the Model 3 SR+ Hansshow Version E Premium Audio upgrade and installed it. Here‚Äôs what I learned:","I have a June 2020 Model 3 SR+. They don‚Äôt include the rear deck surround speakers from the factory, older models do.

I‚Äôve never done any vehicle wiring before, so it was a learning experience and took me much longer than it probably should have (roughly 13 hours in total). I have experience with putting together computers and other electronics, so I figured it wouldn‚Äôt be too difficult/that it wouldn‚Äôt take me very long. (I was very wrong)

Here‚Äôs what I learned:

If you don‚Äôt have experience working on car audio systems or you don‚Äôt have endless time and patience to figure out the somewhat frustrating instructions, you should hire a professional to install it for you. 

If you do want to go ahead with the install yourself, here are some things to keep in mind:

A. Make sure you have the right tools for this. Car panel pry tools, different sized wrenches, hex keys, various sized screw drivers, zip ties for cable management, and a windows laptop. Keep all of different screws and pins that you remove organized in a safe place so that you know which ones go where when putting everything back together again.

B. You have to shut down the car and disconnect both the 12V battery as well as the main battery connection under the rear seats. Make sure to leave all the doors, trunk & frunk, and windows open before you disconnect the 12V battery. If you accidentally close/close your frunk while the 12V battery is disconnect and all of your doors are closed, you‚Äôre in big trouble and might need tesla service to come tow your vehicle to open up your frunk again because that‚Äôs where the 12V is, and nothing in the car can work without it. I accidentally locked my frunk once while the 12V was disconnected and had to jump start the frunk lock through the wires in the tow hitch port at the front of the car. I used a 12V signal from another vehicle to do this. If the car is locked and the doors are closed, that unfortunately won‚Äôt work (so that people can‚Äôt steal things from your frunk).

C. You have to run cables under the carpets of the front two seats. It helps to have long arms to push the cable from one end of the carpet to the other, as you can‚Äôt fully remove them if you don‚Äôt want to glue them back to the car later.

D. The Hansshow video guides for install process are currently out of date and for an older design of their speaker upgrade. Some parts are still relevant and the same, others very much are not. The only piece of information that Hansshow currently has for the new versions are PDFs with pretty low quality images and little explanations. I had to go back and forth between the old videos and the PDF to figure out how to remove certain panels and where to route the wires underneath them. That is why the install took me so much longer than it should have. 

That being said, Hansshow was quite helpful when I spoke with them directly over WhatsApp and asked them loads of questions while I was installing it. They‚Äôre based in China, and seemed to be online from around 6PM PST. This was essential for figuring out a few things that were not detailed in their install guides.

E. Their sound system now takes power and ground from under the rear seats. They tell you to connect the ground wire to part of the car that uses a tesla specific/proprietary nut. I didn‚Äôt have the tool to unscrew it, so I had to connect ground elsewhere.

F. The guide does a quite poor job at explaining where to mount the DSP. I ended up texting them on WhatsApp and they showed me where to mount it. It goes in the gap under the center console, where they also tell you to route the wires through to the driver side of the car. I can‚Äôt attach an image to Reddit, but you‚Äôll know what I‚Äôm talking about if you do the installation. They also include two small double sided adhesive pads to secure the DSP to the car. I ended up using some of my own 3M tape as well because I didn‚Äôt feel like the DSP was secure enough with only the two included pads.

G. Removing the panels often feels like you‚Äôre going to break the connectors when pulling it off. Some do take quite a bit of force to remove. Just take your time and cross your fingers that nothing breaks when you pull them off. I managed to do everything without breaking something. (surprisingly)

H. Once you have everything wired up, reconnect the power to your car and test the sound to make sure all of the speakers are working before you put all the trim panels back on, you don‚Äôt want to have to take them off again if something isn‚Äôt working properly.

I. I found that the cable to connect the rear deck surround speakers isn‚Äôt long enough to actually reach them to the Hansshow DSP under the middle console at the front of the car. They are simple red and black cables, so it wasn‚Äôt hard for me to just cut the connector ends off and extent them by another meter. This only applies if your Model 3 does not include the surround speakers from the factory, since Tesla‚Äôs wiring for them is not there either.

J. When installing the subwoofer, don‚Äôt mount it until you have it wired up and tested it to make sure it‚Äôs working. I also recommend tweaking the settings on it a bit to increase the bass that it outputs. It would be very difficult to do that once it‚Äôs mounted. When mounting it, make sure to really crank the screws down hard, it‚Äôll work better and you really don‚Äôt want the vibrations from it to loosen the screws over time.

K. Make sure to plug in your laptop to the DSP once everything is connected and powered up, and install the Hansshow custom settings on it. That‚Äôs the key step in making everything balanced and sound the way it should. Here‚Äôs where you can find their DSP software and custome profile: [Github Link](https://github.com/Hansshow/Model-3-Audio-Verision-E-DSP-software)
My laptop really did not like their software and told me it‚Äôs a malware/trojan virus, so just beware. I doubt it really is, but anything is possible. My laptop isn‚Äôt my main computer so I just said screw it and turned off my antivirus to open the program quickly and do the software install. 

L. Lastly, here are some helpful videos and links that I refrenced throughout the installation:

Now you may be wondering, was it worth it?

First, the bad:
My only really complaint after installation is that left/right, front/back is now reversed in the sound balance settings, and the chimes for everything are painfully loud, but I discovered that turning on Joe Mode brought them back down to basically stock loudness. Installation was difficult, but it was never going to be easy anyways.

The good:
If you want your car to sound as good as possible, yes, it is 100% worth it. It makes quite a difference to me personally, but I also love a great sound system. Everything sounds much more full and complete, and the added subwoofer adds some good punch to whatever you‚Äôre listening too. The audio experience in the back seats is a LOT better now too with the addition of the rear deck surround speakers. It truly feels like surround sound now because audio isn‚Äôt just coming from the front sound bar.

Overall, I‚Äôm glad that I did this upgrade. I wish the Hansshow installation guides were actually up to date and more clear, but I imagine Hansshow will update their videos for it at some point.

That‚Äôs basically everything I could think of to meantion. Hopefully this was helpful to anyone considering buying this product or about to install it themselves.

I called my local service center, and you would have thought I told them my car was on fire.  They sent out a Ranger right away (I live in a semi-remote location) and the they replaced my screen.  Warm fuzzies all around.

Then about 6 months later, it came right back.  This time I emailed the service center via my app, and got back the same boiler plate many have you have gotten.  ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt effect function.  Repair machine in the works.  Don‚Äôt call us, we‚Äôll call you‚Äù etc.  And while I understand there are worse problems to have, staring at that cigarette-stain-looking border just irritated me.  

About once ever 6 weeks or so, I‚Äôd go on a google search binge and see a lot of complaints but no solutions, THEN I happened upon a thread on telsamotorsclub where a couple of smart people figured out a fix using cheap UV lamps bought off Amazon.  I tried it and it worked!!

*************************************
*************************************
The treatment:  Go to Amazon (or wherever you buy fine UV lamps) and buy either this: 

WELKEY PLUS 50W UV Black Light with Plug(6ft Cable), IP66 Waterproof Ultra Violet LED Flood Blacklight https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MDWKNMK/    ($32.99)  

or 

XICHEN 36W UV Nail Dryer - UV Lamp Light for Any UV gel polish - 4 x 9W UV Lamp White https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B06X8ZVJSS/         ($14.99)

(these are NOT affiliate links and just to help you find them.)

I bought them both, but wound up using the $14.99 ‚Äúnail dryer‚Äù as it already had it‚Äôs own built in box and reflector.  I propped it up on my MCU. It‚Äôs about 1/4 the size of the screen so I  let it run all night and moved it 4 times in four consecutive nights.  The next morning, the yellow border that had been under the light was GONE!!

It might come back, but the treatment is so cheap and easy that redoing won‚Äôt be an issue.  I hope this works as well for you as it did me.**

The TMC link above has a fair amount of discussion and is worth the read.

TeslaMotors,complaint,7puetw,Model 3 - One Week Review,"&nbsp;

*Initial 2 Day Review [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7o5ikv/took_delivery_of_my_model_3_yesterday_day_2_review/)*

&nbsp;

**THE GOOD**

* **Power** - Car's got some heat! Granted, it's no P100D, but it's also a smaller car and still gives that rocket sensation. Catches people way off guard :) My girlfriend screamed. It's not so much the 0-60, but the available torque. Punch it, and you're off. It's SO handy, especially on the freeway. Even at 70-80, punch it and the car responds. 

* **Calm, Silent Ride** - The view from the windscreen is really wonderful, the headlamps ultra bright and wide, and the short nose helps you feel right on top of the road and able to point the car wherever you want to go. Beyond this, the ride just feels smooth. The wood paneling and generally abated sound just give me a relaxing feeling when driving. Fwiw, I got the 19"" wheel upgrade. Not sure to what degree that impacts the quality of the ride.

* **Solid Interior** - The appointments are high grade, seats enveloping and comfortable, and trim done well. There is ample room in the back, and the glass roof is gorgeous. I like how Tesla chose to cut features entirely (auto closing trunk, retractable door handles) rather than skimp on the quality of ones they decided to include. Re: the Alcantara vs Cloth debacle... my visor/headliner/side columns/etc are all grey alcantara.

* **Audio** - One of my favorite things about the car. The sound system is AWESOME.

* **Supercharging** - I had never been to a SC station, so I dropped by this week. Very cool experience, having dealt with Blink and ChargePoint when I had a plug-in Prius. No panel, no input, just park and plug in. The car IDs itself. I felt like the belle of the ball being the only Model 3 around. A LOT of Tesla enthusiasts came to say hi and check out the car. In the end, I paid about $7.30 or so for a 75% charge. 

* **Autopilot** - Took me a little while to get comfortable with it, and learn some of its peculiarities, but Autosteer is a killer feature. Feels like the future. I've taken two 60m freeways trips so far and it's wild to sit there, hands steepled, watching the car drive itself around bends, slowing and speeding up through traffic. Activate the turn signal to change lanes. Autopark is fun too (though on first attempt it parked a bit further from the curb than I would want, and the next day, on second attempt, it parked too far up, out of the box. Still cool, though. I can't wait for Summon and Full Self Driving. Btw - One thing I learned the hard way. Periodically, the car asks you to hold the wheel. It's not enough to just *grip* it, you have to give some gentle resistance and prove you're still awake/alive, without breaking off control (a hard pull will ""click"" the wheel out of the car's control and disable AP). Then, it continues. If you don't input the desired response, AP will shut off and punish you in the sense that it becomes disabled for the remainder of the trip (until you park and shut down). 

&nbsp;

**THE LESS THAN IDEAL**

For the most part, these are software related and feel like things that can be ironed out in future updates. I'll start with the hardware gripes.

* **Dock Noise** - The ONLY thing in the cabin that makes an annoying noise is the phone dock. It rattles. I found that if I lift it a bit, it stops. So, I bought some thin felt pads which I plan to install under the fitting. That should abate the issue. Still waiting for them to arrive, but will report once they do. Side note - I wish the dock had an LED at the charging base.

* **Phone As Key** - I have an iPhone 6, presently. There's no doubt the phone is more cumbersome and slower than a key fob. I like being fob-free, but unlocking my phone, loading the app, navigating to a subscreen, and then hitting a button is longer than I want it to be for opening my charge door or front trunk. Thankfully, the rear hatch has a grip button. 

* **Radio Favorites** - I wish I could organize these. They are in ordinal rank on the main list (fine) but out of order on the hot keys, I believe in the order I added them. Kind of annoying.

* **Using the Screen While Driving** - Climate, Wipers, Radio... It's not quick and easy to do without looking. It can be akin to using your phone (iPad?) while driving. Be careful! I wish I could minimally put climate controls on the right wheel button. 

* **Mapping the Steering Wheel Buttons** - I wish I could do this. See above.

* **Walk Up Unlock Isn't Always Ultra Responsive** - I disabled walk up unlock, so I could enter my garage with my phone and not have the lights turn on and mirrors unfurl every time. Instead, I pull on the door handle or push the hidden button on the trunk hatch. This tends to take ~1-2s. Occasionally it takes 3-5s. I think it's my phone, tbh. Time to upgrade to an iPhone 8 or X, so we'll see if that's any improvement. This is a minor issue, however. 

* **Charger Release on Walk Up** - Pressing the release button on the charger wand doesn't wake/unlock the car like a tug on a door handle does. It should. 

* **Valet Key** - This is the most unresponsive of all the access methods. Until these cars become more ubiquitous, I think valets (and friends/family who are borrowing your car for the first time) are going to have a rough go. It takes some placement, takes what feels like 5+ seconds.

* **Emailing Tesla Customer Service** - Thankfully, I haven't had any major issues. But their email service has been flakey at best. There's no auto-response to let you know your message has been received. My first email about an account issue got no response, my follow-up did after 48 hours, and a separate third email never got a response. Calling, however, is 24/7 and perfect - I have no complaints there.

&nbsp;

**HELPFUL TIPS/INFO**

* FINALLY got my Homelink to work. I have a Genie (rolling code) opener, which is always a pain to program. [This is the method](https://forums.tesla.com/en_GB/forum/forums/homelink-rolling-code-standard-telsa-procedure-doesnt-work-here-was-my-fix) which worked for me. 

* A strange set of circumstances involving moving my car to a new account led me to discover a bug which froze my screen entirely! Unfortunately, that just so happened when it was pouring rain and I had to get somewhere, which meant I couldn't turn on my wipers (as they are controlled via the screen)... haha. The nice thing is the car still reverses, drives etc, even with the screen bricked. But the important part here is that I learned how to 'hard reset' the screen, in cases like this: hold both steering wheel buttons down for ~30 seconds. Wait for the ""T"". Voila. Back in action.

&nbsp;

**7 DAY CONCLUSION**

I LOVE the Model 3. I've owned a Mustang, a BMW ZHP, a Porsche Cayman, and this is by far the most exciting car of them all. 

It's hard to imagine a future where these cars aren't all over the road, in a wide variety of customizations. It's a rad car. Sure, it's rolling out slower than hoped. But it's coming, and it's going to be big. I'm relishing being the only Model 3 on the road, and know it's a fleeting luxury. I haven't seen any others here in LA. 

It's so fun to drive. I'm a nitpicker, and the good outweighs the bad, by a lot. Tesla makes brilliant cars. End of story.

TeslaMotors,complaint,kgxsp7,"Cybertruck ""Design"" is not optional","Tesla is disrupting the car market with electrification that no one thought was possible.  They want to do the same for the pickup market, but truck buyers are loyal to their brand like a sports fan and openly hostile to any other brand.  To break that lock-in, Tesla must offer cost, power and range that are unmatchable.

Unfortunately, a lot of the ""news"" about the Cybertruck has been concept art designed by someone who doesn't understand the manufacturing and material constraints for the Cybertruck.  I'm NOT here to complain.  In fact, I would love to see more concept art that Tesla could actually consider.  That's why I want to educate people about the manufacturing and material constraints for the Cybertruck in simple terms that don't require Sandy Munroe's education to understand.

There's a key number to remember:  $40,000.  That's the base price for the Cybertruck and it undercuts the most popular full-sized pickups.  At this time, it's well-known that Tesla's cheapest trim level never lasts more than a couple months for each model, and I don't expect that $40,000 Cybertruck to be sold for very long.  That doesn't change the need to minimize costs.  This is critical to overcoming the assertion that electric vehicles are too expensive.  So, Tesla has to cut costs in every way they can find to support that price point.

Tesla's battery technology helps here, because they're hitting $100 per kWh before anyone else in the industry.  Tesla's mechanized manufacturing process and online ordering help too.  The machines pay for themselves many times over.   In the future, we'll see how utterly impractical it is to use employees to build and sell cars, because Tesla is leading the way now.

To go one step farther, Tesla has selected stainless steel for the surface of the Cybertruck.  This eliminates the need for a paint shop.  Tesla had many fires in the paint shop and many customer complaints that the paint was spotty.  Honestly, they aren't very good at paint, so this is a big deal.  The target market for full-sized trucks expects a hard-working truck that can take a beating.  Stainless steel creates a strong impression of durability which is great.

Tesla went one step farther to simplify the construction of the cybertruck and used a load-bearing skin.  This seems to escape the attention of many designers (and design students) who want to eliminate that simple triangular shape.  The entire body is a load-bearing truss to distribute the weight of the truck and its cargo to the wheels.   Triangles are critical to making trusses and making the whole vehicle one big triangle is the simplest, most efficient way.

They had to make one more change to make that load-bearing skin work.  The skin is much thicker than most automotive bodies.  This adds strength and durability, but it has a big drawback.  Modern cars use all kinds of crazy, cool-looking curves and design elements that are possible because of the stamping process.  This stretches and bends the steel in complex ways.  As Elon famously said, the thick stainless steel sheets for the cybertruck would break any existing stamping machine.  That's okay though, because Tesla can save money by NOT using stamping machines.  Machines to fold the steel are much cheaper, faster and the result is stronger.

Folded steel is never going to look like a modern automotive design.  It adds up to a significant cost savings.  It creates a lighter-weight vehicle which improves range.  It's stronger which improves handling and hauling.  And it creates a new, iconic design that establishes Cybertruck as a unique brand that will not be mistaken for  anything else.

If you come up with some cool-looking modification it has to take those constraints into account, or it's just a fantasy of a completely different vehicle.  It is NOT news.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/kgxsp7/cybertruck_design_is_not_optional/,Neebat,517771.0,0.9969
TeslaMotors,complaint,hl80c1,Taking a stand on improving Tesla customer support," 

**Disclaimer:**

I may take a hit by posting this but I think it could be good food for thought.  **This is not some sort of anti-Tesla rhetoric but a way we as Tesla owners can support each other when there is a clear wrong.**   To be upfront, I have -not- had any issues with Tesla or customer  service in terms of bad experiences (at least not yet).  I mean, I've  been vocal about FSD and how I think they have been going about it the  wrong way in terms of market penetration but that is another topic.

**The Perceived Issue**

Increasingly  over the last several months I've seen a lot of complaints against the  way Tesla handles something or short changes customers.  I am ever aware  that negative feedback tends to stand out more but here on reddit, for  example, there is a very pro-Tesla crowd so I think it is relatively  balanced out.

That being said,  Tesla, while they have grown leaps and bounds since the original  Roadster, is still very much in its formative years and they tend to  make some questionable decisions when it comes to supporting their  customers (sometimes this is location dependent but also tends to affect  the whole when it comes to policy).  So, I have been thinking, aside  from posting in the Tesla forums, posting here in this subreddit and/or  trying to ping Elon on twitter and hope he acknowledges and fixes an  issue, what other avenue do we have?

**Proposal**

My  thought is if Tesla refuses to acknowledge a clear issue and/or tries  to short-change customers, we could protest by hitting them in the  technological money-maker: opting out of any opt-in data that helps them  improve their AI, software and other improvements that rely on this  data.

**Some Issues or Challenges with this approach**

\-  Of course, one person isn't going to make a difference.  But if we  created a customer 'collective', a sizable 'data protest' might be very  noticeable to Tesla

\- Who decides  what issue warrants a data protest by the collective?  This is a very  reasonable question and I'm not quite sure if I have an answer for it  yet.  Community voting, perhaps?

\-  Requires individual commitment, as each user would have to disable the  opt-in data collection whenever a collective protest is formally  launched

\- This can have a  reduction software improvements for our vehicles.   But I think the  short term effects would be offset by the long term gains

\-  Would this cause Tesla to change the opt-in data system to 'required'  as part of their software update policy or are various regional laws  enough to prevent this from happening?

**How now, brown cow?**

What  I am hoping to see from this is healthy discussions as to the pros and  cons of such an idea and perhaps any other avenues in which Tesla  customers can get the support they deserve when Tesla is at fault.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hl80c1/taking_a_stand_on_improving_tesla_customer_support/,likebutta222,68866.0,0.9654
TeslaMotors,complaint,4kgr76,My One Week CPO Review,"It's been a week since I picked up my October 2012 P85, and I wanted to share my thoughts and concerns with current owners as well as those considering purchasing a used or CPO Model S.

I spent a lot of time researching CPO cars, and familiarizing myself with every available option and feature.  I went into the buying process with extremely high expectations, and after finalizing my various spreadsheets, checking my numbers, doing multiple test drives, double checking tax and fuel implications, and annoying my wife non-stop about everything Tesla, I finally pulled the trigger.  

When my wife and I initially drove out of the Tesla Service Center with our new-to-us P85, I had a ton of buyer's remorse.  I've never spent more than $20k on a car, I've never considered anything but used Toyotas worth my time and money, and I've never had a car payment.  And here I was driving out of the lot with a $48k loan, and trepidation about the reliability, long term value, and practicality of a nearly 4 year old luxury electric vehicle.  I was sure I had just committed one of the gravest errors of my adult life.  How could I have been so stupid?!?

To calm my nerves, I inwardly agreed with myself that I would give it exactly one month, and if at that point I couldn't justify such an extravagant purchase, I'd sale the stupid thing and go find a used 4Runner. 

So off we drove.  I'll try to organize my observations to answer some of the frequent questions I hear as well as the questions I had before buying.

How‚Äôs the performance?

The first thing we realized is that we needed to put our radar/laser detector in our new Tesla ASAP.  We had been on multiple test drives before buying, but we never realized how quickly we would settle into going 0-60 mph in 3.9 seconds at every opportunity, or going 45 to 65 on state roads on open stretches, or 75 up to nearly triple digits on those wide open Texas interstates.  We have seriously had to regulate our enthusiasm on a daily basis.  It‚Äôs just too damn easy to annihilate whatever speed limit you're supposed to be following.  

How does the P85 compare to the P85+?

I‚Äôve never driven a P85+, but I can tell you that the P85 is a little loose in the back when cornering.  Accelerating out of turns is not always predictable, and I can understand how others may very much prefer the stability and advanced tuning in the P85+.  However, for my purposes, the P85 is great.  It‚Äôs smooth enough that my family rides in it comfortably, and it‚Äôs fast and responsive enough to make even a trip to the grocery store a lot of fun.  If you want to do James Bond style maneuvers on the daily, hold out for the P85+.  If you want to occasionally imagine you‚Äôre James Bond on the way to dropping your kids off at school, get the P85.

Do you miss not having a pano roof?

I really wanted a pano roof.  It was near the top of my list of features I was looking for in a CPO.  Honestly, I can‚Äôt say that it matters much to me at this point.  Since I‚Äôm usually in one of the front seats, I can‚Äôt tell what the roof looks like anyways.  When I sit in the back seat, even at 6‚Äô4‚Äù I don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs a problem.  I would probably like a pano if I had it, but it has seriously been a non-issue for me since I bought the car.  If you can get a car with a pano, I say go for it.  If you find a good deal on a CPO and the only thing missing is a pano, go for it as well.  

Is that huge screen distracting?

I‚Äôve had touch screens in my other cars prior to owning a Model S, and I thought the 17‚Äù screen Tesla uses was over kill.  Until now.  I love that giant oversized screen!  It‚Äôs smooth and responsive, intuitive, easy to use, easy to see, and very functional.  The software works very well, and I wish I had a similar option in my other vehicles.  The display unit in the driver‚Äôs side dash is also very helpful.  I really like the steering wheel controls as well.  Overall, it‚Äôs a really nice experience, and I‚Äôm glad Tesla went above and beyond with these particular features.  Could they be better?  Probably.  But I find nothing to complain about with the way things are currently.  I have considered upgrading to 4G LTE, but right now my wife and I agree that the 3G is fine.

Is the upgraded sound system worth it?

While the pano roof was near the top of my ‚Äòwants‚Äô list, the upgraded sound system was near the bottom.  I‚Äôm not an audiophile, and I figured there were other features I‚Äôd rather pay for.  But if I had to choose today between keeping the upgraded sound system or adding a pano roof to the car, I‚Äôd pick the sound system.  I never anticipated enjoying listening to music so much in this car, but it really is a great experience.  The overall range could probably be a little bit better, and I know there are better systems out there, but Tesla has opted for a high quality, well balanced set up that really is a pleasure to listen to.  

Have you noticed any issues with the quality of the vehicle?

I‚Äôve read a lot of negative comments online regarding the 2012 Model S build quality.  For my particular vehicle, I cannot tell that it is any different that the 2015 and 2016 Model S test drive vehicles I‚Äôve ridden in and driven in the past.  There are no creaks or malfunctioning parts (yet) that I have noticed.  If anything, I am blown away with how beautiful and perfect this car is.  A friend that test drove and is considering a P90D rode in my car with me for a while, and she commented that she was surprised to find that she couldn‚Äôt tell a single difference between the interior of my car and the car she test drove a couple of weeks ago.  Obviously, Tesla uses some different parts and engineering in some places today than they did 3.5 years ago, but I think since I don‚Äôt have the pano roof, the number of variables and exchanged parts are not significant.  It‚Äôs also possible that in the 3.5 years since this car was manufactured, Tesla has already swapped out any parts that might have originally created issues for the first owner.

What do you think of the air suspension?

While the air suspension is a cool feature, I don‚Äôt think most people need it.  I live on a dirt road that has some pretty bad ruts in it, and don‚Äôt really see the need for using the air suspension.  I have not bottomed out on anything yet.  It impresses my friends when I show it off, but I bet it‚Äôll cost a fortune to fix when it‚Äôs not covered under warranty.  

Do you like using Slacker to listen to music?

I normally use Google Music at home or in a different vehicle, and I find Slacker radio to be a step behind.  While it‚Äôs easy enough to use, I prefer being able to search for albums and podcasts.  A teenage son of a friend of mine wasn't familiar with Slacker, and when I explained the concept to him he said, ‚ÄúOh, you mean the most advanced car in the world uses a music player from 2010, right?‚Äù  And he‚Äôs pretty much right.  However, the built in Slacker interface is fine for generating radio stations, and hopefully it will get better as we like or dislike certain songs.  Obviously, we can play Google Music through Bluetooth, but I‚Äôd prefer having the ability to link up the car directly to my Google Music account.  Oh well, it‚Äôs a small complaint.

How are the seats?  Can tall people sit in the second row?

Coming from non-luxury and non-performance vehicles, I find the front seats very comfortable.  The lumbar support is nice, and the seat warmer function works just fine.  I haven‚Äôt been on a long road trip yet, so my opinion could change once I have to spend several hours in a row in the car.  In the second row, if I sit straight up, at 6‚Äô4‚Äù my head hits the roof liner.  In a car with a pano roof, it doesn‚Äôt.  However, I don‚Äôt really sit straight up while riding in any car, so if I sit comfortably, I usually have about half an inch to an inch of headroom.  Honestly, I don‚Äôt really think about it when riding in the second row.  But if I was an inch or two taller, it would probably be uncomfortable. 

Should I buy a CPO Model S or wait for the Model 3 to come out?

While everyone has to make this decision on their own, I personally am very happy to have a CPO Model S while also waiting to purchase a Model 3 in a couple of years.  While it‚Äôs possible I could have a Model 3 in as little as 18 months from now, I also believe it could be 24 or 36 months from now.  And since I‚Äôm planning on putting in a third row in my Model S and the Model 3 will never have the option of a third row, as a family vehicle I prefer the Model S.  In essence, since I can afford either, I‚Äôd rather take the Model S today than wait for the Model 3.  If you can find a CPO Model S around $45k that you like, I say buy it, drive it for a couple of years, enjoy all the great things about the Model S, and then decide in a couple of years if you want to keep it or switch to the Model 3.  Who knows, maybe you‚Äôll end up buying a Model 3 as well as keeping your Model S.  What's the only thing better than having a Tesla in your garage? Answer: Having two Teslas in your garage!

What are some features that you like most?   

I love the safety features!  Just knowing that my family is safer in this car than almost any other car on the road helps me sleep better at night.  I also love the acceleration, the quiet ride, how amazing the car looks, and how simple yet clean the design of the interior feels.  I truly enjoy just sitting in this car.  I also love the app!  It's so nice to be able to turn on the AC before getting in the car and check the charge status from my phone.  Also, I love taking friends and family on test drives.  For 99% of them, this is not only the first Tesla they‚Äôve seen in person, but also the first electric car they‚Äôve ever ridden in.  They always rave about the experience afterwards.  My wife and I also agree that being able to operate the car at all times without taking the key fob out of your pocket is a great feature.  You just walk up to the car, and the door handles pop out.  You get in the car, put it in gear, and drive.  Then after you park, you just get out of the car, close the door, and walk away.  The green color with the tan leather is a beautiful combination, and we are a bit prideful that the metallic green has been discontinued.  Not stopping at the gas station!  The friendly comments from complete strangers!  I also love that it took about 5 minutes for my wife to fall in love with her Tesla.  

What are some features you like the least?

I have a couple of complaints here.  My first complaint is that it seems the mileage estimation on the battery charge is extremely optimistic.  I haven't figured it out yet, but it seems that we get about 20% fewer miles per charge than what the screen shows.  Maybe it‚Äôs the way we drive, but even in optimal conditions the battery does not seem to hold up to the extent that the estimated mileage on the screen would lead us to believe. Our second issue, although minor in comparison to the first, is that my wife was really disappointed that there were only 2 cup holders and that there was very little storage in the car.  For me, I saw this as a plus since it forced us to only keep things in the car we really felt we needed.  I can't stand driving around with unnecessary junk in the car.  So we settled on a third party organizer for the floorboard that has 2 extra cup holders, a slot for sunglasses, and a slot for your phone.  My wife also finds controlling the AC a little awkward, but it might be just because we aren't accustomed to the controls yet.  

What surprised you about driving you a Model S?

The windshield wipers!  I did not realize that the car can sense droplets on the windshield and adjust the windshield wiper speed as needed.  The first time it rained while I was driving, I started to look for the wiper controls.  Before I could do anything, the wipers turned on by themselves and adjusted as necessary to the volume of rain.  Once it stopped raining, the wipers stopped.  I was stunned!  After all my research into the Model S, I can‚Äôt believe I didn't know this was a thing.  I know other cars have this feature, but I‚Äôve never experienced it before.  We were also surprised that we could sync the car with our garage door opener, and then it opens and closes the garage door for you.  Unfortunately, it occasionally doesn‚Äôt work as described, and we have to manually press the button on the garage door opener remote (the horror!).  

Do you wish you had autopilot?

Yes and no.  Obviously, it would be nice if I had it, but I don't really miss not having it.  This car is so much fun to drive, even in traffic I don‚Äôt mind being in control of it.  To get a similar car with autopilot, I personally don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth spending the additional $20-25k.  I can live without it until I get my Model 3.  Of course, if I did have autopilot, I would probably feel completely different about how necessary it is.  

Do you still feel like an idiot for buying a $48k used luxury electric vehicle with possible build quality issues?

At this moment, I think I made a great purchase.  I haven‚Äôt thought about the cost once since that first day.  If anything, I think I got a heck of a deal, and I‚Äôm going to enjoy this car immensely over the next 4 years.  I realize things will break, and there will be surprises, but right now I feel comfortable knowing I am covered by the 4 year bumper to bumper warranty.  

Has the overall experience lived up to your expectation?  Any regrets?

I have to say that even though I went into this experience with extremely high expectations, Tesla and the Model S have actually exceeded my expectations.  I didn‚Äôt think that was possible.  There are so many little things about this car that Tesla just nailed.  The few friends of mine that are big Tesla fans have also made comments about how blown away they are with the quality and capability of an almost 4 year old car, and how beautifully the car operates and feels.  It‚Äôs got 48k miles on it, and it feels like it just rolled out of the factory.  My only regret is that I didn‚Äôt find this car sooner.  

TL;DR 
This car is amazing.  I wish I had bought it earlier.

TeslaMotors,complaint,4et4xh,Ten not-so-obvious things I love about the Model X,"Most people know about the big features of the Model X and EVs in general, but I put together a short list of some less obvious things that I have come to really enjoy in the Model X.  I'd love to hear about any others that you all might love!

1. Regenerative braking not only recharges the batteries, but because it comes from the motor, it helps to save wear and tear on the brake pads.

2. The brake hold feature is awesome for taking a short break at a stoplight, or in line at a drive through without having to put the car in park.

3.  If you have to take your car in for service, they recharge the batteries.  I've never had an ICE car gas tank topped off by a dealer.

4.  Autopilot is great for cruising the highway at speed, but arguably it is more enjoyable for stop and go traffic.  Not having to pay close attention to the gruelling process of inching along a highway is really a game changer.

5.  The voice prompts from the GPS come out from the driver side speaker only, and it lowers the volume of the other speakers slightly so that it is easier to hear.

6.  Turning on the A/C via the app (or my watch) a few minutes before arriving at the car is great for these sunny SoCal days.

7.  Valet mode limits the power and speed of the motors, but also locks the frunk and glovebox, and hides your personal info in your calendar app and such.

8.  Most of the controls that you would want to use while driving are accessible via the tactile steering wheel buttons and scroll wheels.  This puts to rest a lot of complaints that the touchscreen buttons are hard to use while driving (which can be true at times).  Climate control, music controls, and info screens are accessible and easy to find via the symmetrical and simple steering wheel controls.

9.  There are speakers in the falcon wing doors of the X.  It is kind of fun to put the doors up and hear the music coming out of the open wings.

10. The flat floor with the six seat config is really nice for some surprising uses.  It's a great spot for my dog to sit, and we have used it to change the baby's diaper.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/4et4xh/ten_notsoobvious_things_i_love_about_the_model_x/,Oysterous,11645.0,0.9973
TeslaMotors,complaint,duyo0s,"Eight months, 18.5k miles, one giant road trip, and two crashes in: I love this car, and here are my thoughts.","I ordered my AWD Model 3 in mid-February of this year and received it on March 2nd. Due to the price changes in that time I was able to get FSD for the original price that I expected to pay. My first few months I had a ton of fun driving it around - taking every excuse I could to drive it. My car was delivered with no issues, and I everything went smoothly other than receiving two marks on my rear bumper while street parked that Sentry mode didn‚Äôt catch. 


After graduating from college in June I set out in early July on a 3.5 month and 15,500 mile road trip. I started off in Maryland and drove straight to Maine in one day. After Maine I explored a lot of New England, then shot west to Seattle, then down to San Diego, up through Albuquerque to Denver, then to Austin, and back east through Nashville and Asheville. Along the way I visited 106 breweries and many national/state parks.


On the whole it was an incredibly effortless road trip. I let autopilot drive about 90% of the way, and only had one bad instance of phantom breaking while I was in Albuquerque which easily could‚Äôve resulted in me getting rear ended. There were a lot of incredibly fun roads to drive which I can tell you about, and I spent two hours going back and forth on tail of the dragon. 


For the most part I had no issues with charging, and stopped at several dozen superchargers along the way. My main complaint as far as that is the number of superchargers near national/state parks. At Glacier National Park I had to spend a night outside it charging at a free level 2 charger while I slept, and couldn‚Äôt explore too much while still getting back to the closest supercharger that day. I also had similar trouble with Mt. Rainier, Crater Lake, and the Grand Canyon wherein I had to plan ahead if I wanted to stay the night, and was limited on how much I could explore with a day trip. I would‚Äôve liked to see Carlsbad Caverns, but would have had to spend the night there at an RV park or other level 2 charger due to a lack of superchargers in the area.


My only complaint over the course of owning this car is that it has been a crash magnet. Other than the previous two unexplained marks it‚Äôs been crashed into twice in the last month while parked. The first time was while I was in Austin towards the end of my trip when my cousin‚Äôs wife [backed into it](https://i.imgur.com/sAmMeTq.mp4) while taking their kids to school. This caused [fairly minor damage](https://i.imgur.com/vA6onnJ.jpg) resulting in the replacement of the driver‚Äôs side front fender, the driver‚Äôs side headlight, and the front bumper. Luckily Tesla was able to do the repairs themselves, and if not for insurance being slow to mail a check it would have been completed within a day. Their insurance paid for everything, and I‚Äôm currently figuring out a diminished value claim. The second time occurred after I got back. Three nights ago, while my car was street parked in west Philadelphia I was notified at 3:50am that my alarm was going off, and ran outside to find [this damage](https://i.imgur.com/VDh4DY9.jpg) from a hit-and-run. I immediately called the police, and while [sentry mode captured it all](https://i.imgur.com/VYH6frd.mp4), it seems the plates didn‚Äôt match the car and the car was likely stolen. I had to file this with my uninsured motorist coverage, but I didn‚Äôt have to pay a deductible out of pocket and it looks like it will be fully covered. 


Other than the accidents I‚Äôve absolutely loved the car, and can‚Äôt imagine owning any gas car again. Someday I want to get a test drive in a 911 or an F-type to see if gas cars are fully ruined for me, but unless I was spending $500,000+ I can‚Äôt see myself buying anything not electric. While my car was in the shop for the last accident I had a Hyundai Tucson loaner and did not like it at all. My Model 3 has been incredibly cheap to run, needed no maintenance other than tire rotations, service has been easy and is far and away my favorite car that I've ever driven.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/duyo0s/eight_months_185k_miles_one_giant_road_trip_and/,broccoliflowers27,1554.0,-0.5884
TeslaMotors,complaint,b26gno,Model 3 repair experience,"**The Accident**: At the beginning of February I was waiting patiently to turn right out of a parking lot, when I looked to my right and saw a CRV starting to back up.  All I could think of was ""oh no"" and it backed into my passenger rear door.  The driver didn't look when backing out of her spot hence why they didn't stop.  Driver was a teenager and she called her parents over to help sort everything out.  We all kept a level head since yelling wasn't going to fix the car.  We joked around a bit and the father was interested in how the car worked.  We choose to go through insurance and I will never forget to this day what the father said to his daughter ""your first accident and you had to go for the big one.""

**The Repairs**:  I took my car to a local body shop that is approved by Tesla (I'm from the Boston area).  They told me that they will need to replace the door and repaint/blend the panels.  Nothing else was damaged it was only the door which was very lucky for me.  Only downside was ordering the replacement part, I was worried I had entered service hell.  Body shop mentioned that parts take a long time to come in.  They also said Tesla was getting better at fulfilling part orders, though it could still take a long time.  So a tentative date of March 6th to fix the car was set and the door was ordered.  To my surprise the door came in early and they said I could drop off the car on the 6th.  After a week and a half the car is all fixed, slight delay since insurance had to go to the shop an re-eval the damage.  After that I was free to come and pick up the car!  They even charged up the battery overnight.

**Conclusions**:  Overall I was impressed how quickly the part came in and how well the work turned out.  I have heard stories about cars sitting in repair shops for months, the difference here is my car could still be driven.  I do see my experience as a sign things are getting better, parts being sent out faster.  Only thing I would like to see is more body shops getting certified since there are only five shops ""near me"" and one of them is in Providence RI.  But other than that no complaints, happy to have my Model 3 back!

Very impressed. 
My only real complaint was how bad the rear camera was compared to my S. 
Is Tesla really saving that much money using such an inferior camera? Did I get a bad one?
It really had a hard time with changes in lighting. Looked darker than normal. Colors off. And overall resolution was pretty low quality. 
Such a great car, seems silly to have that pretty screen display a bad image.

TeslaMotors,complaint,9gdf4c,"[Discussion] Model 3 [RWD] acceleration is good, but the handling/traction/stability control is phenomenal","So, I finally picked up my Model 3 after a couple delays and was enjoying the acceleration and nimbleness around town and on the highways. It was really great never having to wonder, ""hmmm, can I make this gap?"" The car was nimble and quick in these situations and it put quite the smile on my face.

Then the real fun started. I went to visit my brother this weekend via the most windy hill-country back roads in the area. I'm talking multiple back to back hairpin turns, crazy right angles and sweeping curves that seemed to go on forever. There had also been off and on rain that day and the roads had lots of damp spots in them (probably around 40%) so I wasn't planning on pushing it too hard.

The car seemed to disagree with that assessment. It took the first few corners with ease, and seemed to be asking me, ""Really, is that all you got?"" So I progressively upped the ante until I was pushing the envelope and invoking the true spirit of the Model 3. I was simply at awe at how fast I could take these corners.

The tires were squealing, the car started sliding, and then bam, the traction control would kick in, re-grip me and straighten me out so that I could hammer it coming out of the curve. It was truly a thing of beauty. I was honestly expecting more understeer, but there was only one occurrence of that the entire time. A slight oversteer promptly corrected by the computers happened much more often, and it was exhilarating. I have never had a driving experience anywhere close to this.

My only complaint is that I felt that the brakes were a little soft for that aggressive style of driving. I did get pretty scared at one point when it didn't feel like it was braking fast enough while I was going down a slight grade approaching a 120 degree turn that was coming up, but in the end it [barely] managed to slow me in time.

TLDR: As a result of the traction and stability control, the handling of the Model 3 gives the most amazing and thrilling driving experience I could ever imagine, even in partially wet roads. Actually, it was beyond anything I could have imagined- just unbelievable.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9gdf4c/discussion_model_3_rwd_acceleration_is_good_but/,Devolved1,5064.0,0.9749
TeslaMotors,complaint,99kuse,Terrible experience with Tesla service,"I had a day-1 (day 0 line.  Waited overnight) reservation. Got the LR model 3  in March. Driven 8k miles. Absolutely amazing car.  Love the experience every single time I drive it.  

However, yesterday I parked my car in a mall garage and got back to the car to see a break in.  Driver side rear window and the quarter glass both broken.  Stuff from the trunk was stolen (with the rear seat folded). Paint on the driver side rear door was scratched too. 

Today I tried to get a service appointment at Tesla service center. Sunnyvale. The person attending to this matter was rude and just gave two visiting cards.  One for glass repair and one for body panel repair. 
I‚Äôm well aware of the change in policy that such repairs are handled at Tesla approved body shops.  But the attitude of the employee at the service center was just shocking. Then I went to Tesla service center Fremont to see what they‚Äôd say. Similar message and very similar tone.  Very rude and dismissing.  I asked for an avenue to post a complaint and was told to just go home and do it online. 

I asked if customers are happy to run around to different repair shops (one for body panels and one for glass) after paying $60k+ for a car. The service manager lady responded saying that customers are in fact happy to do so, because Tesla doesnt deal with any insurance provider for service (this is utterly ridiculous). Hence customers find it easier to directly deal with insurance at a body shop, instead of later getting reimbursed. 

I‚Äôve never owned a luxury car before.  Used to have a Mazda3.  Mazda had much better service and service personnel than what I experienced today.  
I completely understand that service centers have to go by the company‚Äôs policies, often decided at a much higher level.  But being in the service department, courtesy goes a long way.  Especially when you sell a product for $60k. 

End of the day, I only got an appointment for next Monday to drop in my car at a body shop.  Insurance (fortunately) agreed to provide a rental before I drop the Tesla for repair works.  Its another problem that I have to find a place to park the rental (I live in a apartment complex with limited parking). 

With such terrible experience, I just can not recommend this car to friends and family. Its an amazing car until you have to deal with the service center. YMMV.

TeslaMotors,complaint,hoenem,Extended thoughts on test driving the MY and m3 today,"So my mother and I scheduled a split test on both cars today, starting with the y. I'm not really a car guy, my daily has been a 2013 outback and other than some awful wind noise and shitty interior window trim that catches and folds over with humidity, it's been solid, if boring. My main priority of the test was seating comfort of both as that's always a catch for people over 6ft and most cars in general. For reference I've driven a fair handful of german and japanese luxury over the last 15 years and that's my gauge for the car. 


First impression getting in the MY was the seats were excellent ergonomically. I had plenty of headroom, slightly more than the audi Q8 we drove over in. Just the right amount of support for me. Headrest locked was no issue for me (6'2"") or my mom (5'2""). Already a win. Back seat was comfortable enough, no complaints.


 I have briefly driven a relative's MS 2 years ago so I kinda knew what to expect but didnt get to put mustard on the acceleration as I was just going around the corner for smokes. The regenerative breaking is the only awkward transition from gas, and by my guess it will be totally normal with a few hours driving experience.


I did try gunning it from 20-50 mph and that was definitely sexy. The silence is so satisfying compared to the anemic whining of the outback, or even when a G wagon roars its tank engine (fyi g wagons suck to drive)


Ride quality was very good, a little stiff but there was a nice tactility to it and the steering wheel had just enough resistance in it, maybe a bit whippy(?). Could feel whippy compared to audi, which is ridiculously slick and featherweight by my standards. Maybe closer to a cayenne in steering feel. 


It was 106* in scottsdale today and the AC was pretty oppressively powerful and fun to tweak. 


Sound quality was great, not excellent, though I didnt really blast it. Miles over my subaru stock speakers, though probably doesnt match whatever speakers are in a gle63 amg I've driven, but that's not a totally fair comparison against a car well over double the price. 


My mother took the wheel and she had slightly more awkwardness with the regenerative breaking, but handled it fine. Her priority is ride comfort and plushness, favors Benz for this reason (E class and up interiors are so refined, if a bit overrought and distinctly non-athletic) so her main competition will probably be the 2021 e350 coming this fall.


While she was driving I did take note of the shitty interior trim and loose panels and such, still blatant even in a test car. The back seat had that infamous misalignment. That said I love minimalist aesthetic (minimalism in general) and wouldn't be super bothered by it if I can find ways to tuck and flush these things.


Trunk and frunk space was much bigger in person than I anticipated from online research, very nice. 


The model 3 (rwd) was mostly the same experience. A bit awkward getting in and out compared to the MY but to be expected. Seating and headroom was still amazing, a hair less headroom due to the way the a pillar curves and bulges up to the glass roof I suppose. Width felt virtually identical. Drive was definitely more grounded and didnt have as deep a lurch when releasing the gas pedal. Both had identical tiny rear visibility but not dangerously so. Back seat I had a literal milimeter between my knees and the driver seat in my settings, but headroom was all clear.


As someone who isn't a gear head, but respects the battery powered future, both were total wins to me. My priority is seat ergonomics, and general ease of use, and both were super duper, plus the emissions in the toy box got a long laugh from both of us.


Gun to my head, I like the extra capacity of the Y, but the 3 is better driving. Frankly I dont need the cargo space, but utility when necessary is nice, like an occasional home depot/costco run, but its the only major perk to pay 5k more over the M3.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hoenem/extended_thoughts_on_test_driving_the_my_and_m3/,dskwon,12997.0,0.9983
TeslaMotors,complaint,nrmbk6,"Sentry not flashing headlights or ""recording"" warning with red eye on touchscreen when walk by vehicle","I just accepted Model Y delivery over the weekend.  Sentry seems to be working in terms of recording, but it doesn't flash the headlights or show the ""recording"" warning with the red eye on the touchscreen when walking near video.  I also tried gently tapping on the vehicle and pulling the handle, the latter of which just reminded me via touchscreen to use the key card. Of course I made sure my key phone/card/fob were all far away from the vehicle.  I saw someone else post about this with a Model 3 recently although I can't find the post now so maybe it was on a non-reddit forum (there were only 2 replies which said they should report to service).  I've already opened a service request but no reply yet. When I chatted with Tesla support they speculated that due to complaints about too many Sentry alerts when people are just trying to walk by the vehicle they reduced the sensitivity.  Has anyone else experienced this?  I walk by other Teslas every day that are still flashing headlights with the touchscreen warning, although maybe they are missing a software update that I applied, or could it be another hardware change that came with the removal of radar in my vehicle.

TeslaMotors,complaint,9bgb40,"Autopilot, full self-drive, and road hazards.","I've had my Model 3 for a month, and I love it.  I've got about 3000 miles on it with many of those autopilot miles. Today I had a 500 mile round trip and ran into a few issues that bring up more questions.

First, flying along at 80mph with autopilot engaged and a truck a ways up the road had a blow-out.  A massive piece of tire and more scrap ended up in the middle of the lane I was in.  I took over control and slowed/swerved into the shoulder, but I did wonder - how will Tesla account for road debris like this in full self-drive?  Between debris on the road, potholes and animals I feel like there is a lot of uncertainty that will have to be accounted for and I hope they can do it, but it concerns me.

On the way home I was changing lanes without autopilot turned on and I started hearing a strange noise, almost like there was something on the tire.  I pulled off at the next exit and inspected my wheels, looked at my tire pressure, and all seemed well.  Got back on the road and 5-10 miles later I get a bunch of warnings about tire pressure and to pull over immediately.  Those warnings were excellent, I was able to pull to the shoulder, get out and watch the tire deflate.  I figured out later that there was a 4"" bolt that went through the tire and sidewall.

Tesla roadside assistance was extremely pleasant but they were a bit limited.  The first thing both agents I spoke to said to me was ""hmm, there doesn't seem to be any service centers around you"".  I'm going through central Nebraska, so nope.  They checked the nearest town for other tire shops, saying they preferred Costco, Discount Tire, or high end dealerships like Mercedes and Audi.  Nope, none of those in this town.  They gave me the numbers of a couple tire shops in town to call.  The shops I called were closing and didn't have the size tire needed.  Walmart did.  I'm not a fan of Walmart, and I'm even less of a fan of their auto services but with few other options thats where we towed the car to.  They were closed by the time I got there, so I'm spending the night in a nearby hotel.

I don't really a complaint - but it really makes me think about these road hazards and what can be done about them.  The Tesla agent was kind of stumped, she said this type of situation doesn't happen often - but it's only going to become more frequent for Tesla and I am sure it happens for other automakers, especially as spare tires become less common.

Some sort of Tesla roadside spare tire service would be nice.  Give me a temporary and send me to the service center or mobile service to return it when I'm done.  Overall I'm happy with how everything has been handled so far, but I think this situation would be unacceptable for some folks out there.

Do you think Tesla needs to improve roadside options in more rural areas?  How do you think Tesla will handle road hazards in full self-drive?  How do other autonomous vehicles do it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9bgb40/autopilot_full_selfdrive_and_road_hazards/,reflexiveblue,39999.0,0.986
TeslaMotors,complaint,5ymcov,"Why does the AP stalk settings adjust follow distance by ""car length"" and not time in seconds?","I really don't get this. Every motor handbook and safety guide ever printed talks about follow distance in terms of the ""2 second rule"". 

It's often suggested to follow 3s-4s. This is my personal comfort zone. I like somewhere between 3s and 5s depending on conditions. 

What this means is adjusting the stalk settings all the time based on speed because the settings adjust the follow distance based on ""car length"". 

In practical terms if I'm on the highway cruising at 70mph I like the car length follow distance to be at 4 or higher. 

But below 35mph a setting of 4 is silly. I end up way too far back from cars in front of me and feel like every driver around me is cursing at the stupid Tesla. 

Solution is to adjust the follow distance constantly based on speed. Which goes directly against the goal of the driver assistance features of letting the car take care of the mundane tasks. If I'm fiddling with the follow distance setting constantly it's not exactly ""autopilot"" is it?

So what gives?  Why did Tesla implement this setting in this way?  And why do people accept it as such?  I would expect far more complaints about it. People seem to be rather quiet about this issue.

TeslaMotors,complaint,dlclfu,Tesla Solar,"I am having someone come out on Wednesday to talk to me about it, I have seen previous posts and complaints about either the service or how people must put down a deposit to speak with anyone. I do not see the issue about the deposit as it is only $100 and it is fully refundable but that is just me. The process seemed very quick and seamless so far, I just went to one of the local centers, talked to someone about solar for 15 mins on Yesterday (Sunday), gave them my number, email, and address. The next day (Today/Monday) got a call to schedule an appointment, and since the fiance and I are off this Wednesday (just 2 days away) we were able to schedule an appointment and will have someone coming out to talk to us more about Solar for our home. So far the experience has been easy and excellent! I just have a few questions to anyone who either spoke with Tesla or bought Tesla Solar panels. 

&#x200B;

1. What should I expect and are there some specific questions I should come prepared with before my meeting?
2. I am looking at the panels but the power walls seem enticing, anyone got both? Pros and cons? Was it worth the extra money? My main concern is that they are $7600 with install per wall and online it was saying I would need 2 which would cover me for 100% for up to 7 days fully charged vs 1 would only cover 100% for 1 day (the math seems off but there is obviously something I am missing) I have also seen that with the walls I can still use the panels even during a power outage vs without them I would not be able to. Now I do not expect to have a ton of power outages and I would assume i would only have 1 maybe 2 a year and although having power for even those outages would be nice the extra 7-15k seems like a lot for that luxury. 
3. The fiance is really scared as she has only really heard the horror stories about how people got Solar and they thought going in it would cover 100% of their electricity costs but it did not and instead, it was costing them more to pay for the panels and electricity and how they hated ever going Solar. Has anyone has this experience here?
4. Lastly for the ones who pulled the trigger with Tesla, was there a specific reason why? Has it been rainbows and butterflies from start to finish and even after for any service? For us we just want to be 1 and done, we love Tesla, we have a 3 and the fiance will be getting an X soon. So we are giving them a shot and I do not want to spend days/weeks getting other quotes and people coming out to our house. 
5. P.S. Other than these 4  questions is there anything you would tell a first-time buyer of Solar that you wish you were told before making the jump?'

I just want to say thank you to all that reply and help out, I may not post much and when I do it is not really that important but it would be greatly appreciated if you read this and had any input I would love it as this is a big decision for us and our home!

TeslaMotors,complaint,fhsu7z,Tesla replacement parts and service issues. My experience.,"I am a huge fan of Tesla and Elon, but wanted to detail my frustration with after sales availability of spare parts.

Recently I was involved in accident where a young driver drove through a stop sign and hit my car. Unfortunately this happens and my car was sent to the authorised Tesla repairer, which was an hour away. 

The repairer was on the ball, but they had to wait up to a week after placing a order with Tesla to receive the ETA on the replacement parts. Even with this wait the repairer had to contact Tesla multiple times to receive the confirmation.

Eventually after two weeks all parts were confirmed with ETA's applied. This was OK, now I had the information to make a decision on a temporary vehicle while i waited.

Fast forward to five weeks later and now i get a call from the repairer stating that Tesla has updated the final part (which was due in the next 5 days) to back-ordered with an unknown delivery status. My car was due for pickup in 6 days.

Now I can understand issues can arise but this does seem like Tesla's systems are failing them. Considering the airfreight and delivery time to our location in Australia I would have expected this part to be shipped on the day or before Tesla informed the Repairer.

The fact that a part, which is still used on every Model S is now not available and with no new delivery date is very hard to believe and is very frustrating.

I have heard many stories about replacement parts on this forum and now share in their frustration.

I have had many dealings with Tesla and my personal opinion is that sales and service side of the Tesla business needs some focus ( Contrary to Elon's opinion). Elon has many positives which drives this company forward regardless of the sales and service, but Tesla could be so much more if they made improvements here.

Recently I purchased a Model 3 Performance and while I visited the Showroom and dealt with customer service to make my order. This was a reasonably fast procedure, the sales staff were not that knowledgeable nor were focused on making a sale, which is completely fine as this is how Tesla wants it to be. Nowhere through the process were we told about any additions or given the opportunity to by any accessories, which we wanted to buy.

On pickup, we asked about the phone USB cables and were told that we had to order them, so we went home to do it online. Quickly we found that we cannot order them online, we would have to order them from the Telsa showroom. We phoned and waited 20 minutes for the accessory to be arranged, but the guy had to call us back and let us know. A few days later we called again to get an update, to which we were told they have been ordered in and they will let us know when they arrive. 2 weeks later we call the store to check and eventually we were told that they have just arrived and that we can come down to pick them up, but only Monday - Friday, which i guess is ok since they are a service department next to the showroom.

We went to the store and waited 45 minutes for them to find the parts and then do a manual card payment to buy the iPhone cable. This cable is sold by Tesla for $14 AUD and it comes with  2 cables a USB C and a Iphone cable. The labour cost to sell and provide this cable to us would have been at a loss. ( phone calls and time we spent in store). Tesla would have made less of a loss if they had included the cable with the car, or they should have priced the cable correctly. An iphone cable in Australia is sold for $30aud, and Tesla could have charge $40aud for the cable without too much complaints. Additionally Tesla could have had a better sales experience and let us purchase this at the time of sale and the other items my wife wanted, but they have proven too hard to sort.

Tesla, in my opinion ( which may not be right) is leaving too much money on the table. Selling the accessories for the car at the right price would help to offset the sales teams. Likewise replacement parts for repairs should have a higher markup than when used on finished cars (which I would expect to be the case) and as a result shipping replacement accessories to repairers should be a lucrative business to the benefit of Tesla. Even increasing the replacement parts by another 10% would not be too much of an issue.

What is bad for Tesla is the reputation they are getting in the repair market for the inability to supply replacement parts or accessories in a timely manner, which should not be the case.

I will continue to wait for the replacement part as this is beyond my control.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/fhsu7z/tesla_replacement_parts_and_service_issues_my/,nidanjosh,3502.0,-0.8953
TeslaMotors,complaint,5nlgar,New software update (2.52.22) rolls back hard speed limit with auto steer.,"Just got a software update and took a drive. AP is now exhibiting new behavior... it's allowing me to run auto steer above the speed limit, up to whatever my relative offset is from the posted limit. 

I was driving down a 45mph street and enabled AP. It went to 48 MPH and engaged. My offset was +3. When I tried to bump it to 50, it said it was limited to 48. 

Then I went in and changed the offset to +5 and tried again. I could go 50 without complaint. 

Yay! Nice to have slightly-over-the-limit be an option again.

TeslaMotors,complaint,dg0gtt,Model 3 2700+ mile Road Trip UX Report,"Wife, baby (2 mos.), and I recently returned from a 2700+ mile road trip. I'll try to boil it down to some bullet points. We were on version 10 of the software as of the end of September.

Why I love the car:

* We spent about $100 on e-fuel for the entire trip.
* Autopilot is great at alleviating fatigue.
* Car is amazingly responsive at any speed.
* Car seats are not too bad: fewest aches and pains of any car I've owned and I'm not getting younger.
* No complaints from the backseat passengers about the rear seats (wife attended to baby in back seat), especially after moving front passenger seat all the way forward.
* Plenty of cargo room, especially with tow hitch cargo box (travelled with bassinet).
* Headlights are darn good. Brights are really nice.

Unfortunate realities:

* Many superchargers are not located near convenience stores or readily-accessible restrooms. It is awkward to use a restroom in a restaurant when you only want to stop for 20 minutes.
* I can't wait for FSD on the freeways. There are seriously long stretches of road with nothing happening and there is no need for me to constantly apply torque to the steering wheel. Do like GM does and have the camera watch me to see if I've fallen asleep or something.

Needs Improvement:

* BIGGEST GRIPE: I would plug in to charge and then leave to use the facilities and my wife would stay in the back seat to feed the baby. The car would lock, arm the alarm, and turn off the HVAC with her still in the back seat. This is incredibly difficult having to remember to switch the HVAC to stay on *every single damn time I leave the car*. Just remember the setting or -- better yet -- sense the presence of another passenger in the back seat! There's a weight sensor and a seatbelt sensor (and a camera!), and her phone key is still in the car with her. Surely there could at least be a preference to keep the car on until **all** the phone keys have departed, no? Also, my wife got out of the car, the car alarm went off, and she couldn't get back into the car with the baby now locked in the back seat and the alarm horn blaring.
* Navigate on Autopilot has a ways to go.
   * Mid-lane change swerves/aborts (for no apparent reason) startle the passengers.
   * NoA suggested unnecessary lane changes (to the left in order to ""continue on route"") as we passed exit ramps.
   * NoA wanted to change out of the passing lane too soon after passing. I like to leave at least 2 seconds of distance before changing back, or to see both headlamps in my center mirror (if traffic allows). 
* All supercharging stations need at least one nose-in charging spot. We were traveling with a tow hitch cargo box and backing into a charge spot without the use of the rear camera or sensors (blocked by the cargo box) was unnecessarily stressful.
* USB music playback is buggy. We had to restart playback on multiple occasions when the car simply stopped playing an album mid-track.
* Rear passengers would like more control of rear ventilation in addition to simple directional controls. Perhaps something to add to the mobile app?
* Auto high beam seems to effect the ire of sensitive oncoming drivers. Sometimes I just want a manual mode.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/dg0gtt/model_3_2700_mile_road_trip_ux_report/,LabRodent,1487.0,0.4528
TeslaMotors,complaint,aarrqx,"On our second family trip in a Model 3, 200+ miles, in freezing conditions","Skip to the end for a TL;DR.

**Background**

My wife and I bought a Model 3 back in September. We chose it over a short range variation for a bunch of reasons, not the least of which is the fact that we live in Ontario and received a substantial government rebate that has since then gone away. Although we live 10-20 minutes from work and have a short commute, I'm originally from the States and planned to regularly drive the car to a small town in Western NY, which made Tesla (with the supercharging network) and the long-range ideal.

**The Trip**

We took our first long-range trip as a family in November, where we encountered a few minor issues. First - it was snowy, and, although we'd ordered winter tires, they'd not arrived yet. The snow wasn't an issue, but there were a few slippery moments, so I would definitely recommend the purchase of winter tires to anyone who lives in a snowy climate.

The second issue was charging related. When I first bought the car, I took a ""test trip"" down by myself. I was able to plug the car into a 120v washer outlet at my mom's house and get a trickle charge. I also had to rely a bit on a destination charger at a hotel, which charged at a more standard rate of around 30mph.

However, when I went down with the family in November, for whatever reason, the outlet no longer produced enough electricity to charge the car. I had to drive into a nearby city and use another hotel charger, while I watched a movie at a nearby theatre and then went shopping at Wal Mart. My wife was not pleased, as it is simply not super convenient to have to rely on me leaving the family for an extended period to charge the car enough to get home.

On the most recent visit, we attempted to resolve that issue by staying in a hotel the first night. This is not something we are willing to do every trip -- it's expensive, and, while we were able to charge the car back up to 310 miles, the act of driving it the next couple of days still reduced the remaining charge quite a bit.

The other issue was the range itself. The car boasts a 310 mile range, but for a bunch of factors, that's just not accurate, at least not in winter. I believe we got around 220-230 miles of real world usage out of it. I decided to not super charge on the trip down, but instead to just get to the hotel, where the car predicted we'd have around 20% remaining.

This did turn out to be accurate, although we *did* have to super charge due to being rear-ended on the highway. We did a lot of extra driving, but got the car back close to 100% charge before resuming our trip. Fortunately, btw, the car survived being hit without much issue - just a scratched bumper that is slightly dislocated on one side. 

Once we were in town and fully charged, I did go out to dinner with my best friend and, while there, topped the car up a bit. Nevertheless, due to random driving and perhaps some battery depletion due to the cold, we couldn't reach our originally targeted supercharger on the way home, settling instead for one that was a bit closer. It worked out with no complaint, but it was still disappointing that we had to adjust our schedule a bit.

**The concerning issues**

We're totally ok with the real-world range of the car, though we are definitely glad that we didn't settle for a shorter range as that would complicate things greatly. While Tesla is working to extend its infrastructure quite a bit, the reality is that, to travel to my childhood town in the middle of nowhere, we have to get a bit creative. 

Our options are basically: 1) rent a hotel, negating any savings from gas (and then some); 2) install a more powerful charging outlet at my mom's house, which is difficult to decide to do, since I suspect we will only have to use it perhaps 6 to 10 times ever; or 3) plan to spend some time in a hotel parking lot on every trip in order to ensure that there's enough range to get home.

But the real challenge was this: on my last night in town, when I went back to the same hotel with my friend to top up the car, *neither destination charger worked.* What if they'd been out of commission on the first night when we desperately needed them? Fortunately, they had a third charger that was for non-Teslas, and I used my adapter to charge up the car. But what if that one also didn't work for mysterious reasons?

Same thing with the superchargers. At the one in Ontario where we stopped on our way down, there were only two stalls open. One was out of order. On our way back, coming through Buffalo, NY, there were also only two stalls open. It's a bit scary to consider that with slightly worse luck, our trip would have become greatly inconvenient.

My hope is that Tesla will continue installing superchargers, and that the hotel chargers will be more reliable. I have **zero** regrets with the car, but it was a hard sell to my wife, and the negative experiences with charging on trips has soured her view a bit.

**TL;DR**

If you are driving a Tesla on a long car ride in the cold...

* have winter tires
* expect to lose about 20-30% of range due to heating, headlights, etc.
* sometimes the destination chargers don't work
* sometimes the superchargers are totally full
* have a contingency plan
* I didn't mention it earlier, but animals don't know what to make of the car. I've had several close encounters with squirrels, who seem baffled at the quiet machine rapidly moving toward them. If you are driving in an area that is populated by deer, be extra vigilant

**Bottom line**

This is an awesome car, but it can still be a bit of a challenge to take it places. Make sure you are prepared for issues on those kinds of trips.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/aarrqx/on_our_second_family_trip_in_a_model_3_200_miles/,Haquistadore,87424.0,0.9846
TeslaMotors,complaint,kku2zq,Blind spot monitoring much improved after X-mas update ?,"Hi everyone.  I've had my 2021 model 3 for about a week now and one of the things that really bothered me with the car was the really poor options for blind-spot monitoring.  Before taking delivery, I knew that this was a common complaint but I assumed that you would just use the visualization on the display to monitor your blind-spot.  That turned out to not be true, as the car would not consistently display your blindspot.  

That seems to have been fixed with the xmas update.  I had a 5 hour road-trip today and paid close attention to the visualization on the display.  I would notice that, the instant a car begins to move to my blindspot, it would always show up on the visualization.  For the entire 5 hour drive, I noticed this to be true, which makes me extremely happy.

TeslaMotors,complaint,f6v2qt,New Developments at GF Berlin/Brandenburg (Source: Tabloid Newspaper),"Potsdam - Judicial thriller about the planned Tesla car factory in Brandenburg! BILD learned: The Green League, which had filed suit against the early start of construction, offered the US company a settlement on Thursday. Because of their appeal, the Higher Administrative Court had ordered a stop to clearing the factory site on Saturday.

Now league boss Heinz-Herwig Mascher (61) suggested: The environmental association withdraws its complaint - if Tesla pays extensive compensation measures for its intervention in nature. For example, 30 kilometres of motorway perimeter were to be planted with protective hedges against sand and dust storms.

The car manufacturer agreed. But: The ""Association for Landscape Conservation and Species Protection in Bavaria e.V."", which is also complaining, agreed. (VLAB) lay crosswise. Because only two of the four board members agreed to the settlement, the Bavarians did not withdraw their complaint.

Bad for Tesla - and for Green League leader Mascher, who comes empty-handed to a special meeting of his club on Thursday evening. League members want to depose the board because they had acted against Tesla without consulting the club.

Now the Berlin court must decide. ""The judges have been discussing the case intensively since Tuesday,"" said OVG spokesman Ulrich Marenbach. ""The decision could still be made on Thursday evening, Friday at the latest. In case Tesla makes a positive decision, he can clear the field before the breeding season.

If the conservationists win, Tesla will have to wait until the end of the consultation process on 18 March. But then tree felling will no longer be allowed. The start of construction of the car factory would be delayed until autumn. Brandenburg's Minister of Economics J√∂rg Steinbach (63, SPD) fears that the car company could then pull out.

The Potsdam government is now hoping for a ""two-part"" decision, BILD was told: the court could allow the clearing because the forest can be reforested. And ban all measures that are irreversible until Tesla has a building permit. But this is not supposed to be there until May at the earliest.

It was an overcast day, my Tesla is silver and my lights were set to auto, but only the daytime running lights were on. In previous cars I've always driven with headlights on for safety reasons, but Tesla makes that kind of a pain and I've gotten lazy and relied on the Auto setting which is not great.

If you set headlights to auto, they don't come on when it's grey out and the daytime lights really aren't that bright. If you set headlights to on, the car chimes at you when you get out and the lights just reset themselves to auto when you return.

It sure would be nice if I could just LEAVE THE DAMN HEADLIGHTS ON without having to tap on the screen three times before every drive.

TeslaMotors,complaint,f8vwtl,Buying a model 3 long range single motor in Vancouver Canada,"Hey had a test drive yesterday of a model 3 and I really enjoyed the car. I believe the amount that my monthly payment would come out to would be a little lower than what I pay in gas every month for my current car (370z which is a pig). Also the insurance is virtually the same price, so it seems like a no brainer to me cause I'd literally be saving money every month driving a Tesla. I just wanted to ask 2 questions that I'm not entirely sure about.

1st) I'm assuming there are lots of model 3 long range owners on here. How have you like the car so far? Any real complaints? Anything you love about the car (aside from now gas).

2nd) There is a 8k provincial rebate that apparently might be ending on March 31 according to the sales man? Does anyone have additional info on this? Also I've researched online that there is a federal rebate of $5000 am I eligible for both of these for a total of 13k or am I missing something?

Thanks in advance!

This is really annoying when I am just trying to give extra space to motorcyclists passing by me in the carpool lane.

To set the target speed back to what it was before, I either have to manually increase it with the steering knob or completely turn off auto-pilot by pushing up on the gear stalk, waiting a second or two, then pushing down on it twice to turn auto-pilot back on with the default target speed.

TeslaMotors,complaint,aa60mv,"MCU1 Pole position, breakout and joystick suport.","Since there appears to be some argument that Pole Position on MCU1 was disabled because it's ""slow"" and Tesla would not do it otherwise, I shot two videos today:

1. [Playing pole position and breakout (~~a model3 exclusive game that is even run with sound enabled - that's how low cpu it needs~~a hidden game with no way to start conventionally) on my MCU1 car (forgot to show the game menu to show it's really mcu1 car, so hopefully you can trust me here)](https://youtu.be/FdU3ktsBe-A)
2. [On the same MCU1 car, connected PS3 joystick and it works, though the key bindings are somewhat strange.](https://youtu.be/nNi1Ceaq5mk)

Not all games work well PS3 joystick (or analog) - breakout in particular is really bad because the analog position turns into absolute positioning of the racket. Pole position joystick control is also somewhat strange. Perhaps soem sort of.a snes key-only gamepad would have been better?

Now if you want to enable those thing on your own MCU1 car (and have it rooted already), this is what you do:

For joystick support, [get kernel modules from here](https://app.box.com/s/ty0kqx3k6aiup7nkbfn6wk6ba4rnga2y) transfer to the car and insmod.

1. joydev.ko - you always need that
2. xpad.ko - this is for xbox controllers (untested)
3. hid-sony.ko - this is a hacked ps3 joystick driver to work with the kernel config of the car (I disabled LED and power/charging support - hence don't be afraid that the LEDs on the back still blink as if the joystick is not active, it is (just don't forget to turn it on))

After that you will need to edit /etc/apparmor.d/usr.local.bin.launch-mametesla file on the cid, add the line

    /dev/input/** rw,

twice, once after ""/var/log/mame w,"" and once after ""/dev/tegra_sema rw,"" (I am too lazy to see if only once is enough)

If to start the Mars madness (no, you cannot rename the zip of the ROM, apparently names are hardcoded in mame for specific emulation targets):

1. start TeslAtari
2. in your root shell run ""stop mame"" - this will stop current game, mame screen will turn blank.
3. in the same root shell run ""start mame game=ppspeed""

For breakout, same as above only in the step 3 replace **ppspeed** with **sbrkout**

Looking at the launcher apparently Tesla does whitelisting of ROMs and outside of the ones we know about, two more are in the wings (or at least were considered): gravitar and warlords.

NB to the Tesla dev that did this mame hack on mcu1:

1. you need to add mkdir permissions for /home/mame into the apparmor definition otherwise ini, cfg and other dirs cannot be created and there's a ton of complaints in the kernel log from apparmor.
2. Consider also allowing /dev/input/** as I do - this would bring keyboard and mouse support with no other changes
3. Do consider enabling the joystick drivers in the kenrel config, you need to add CONFIG_INPUT_JOYDEV, CONFIG_JOYSTICK_XPAD and for PS3 before the CONFIG_HID_SONY shows up you also need to enable CONFIG_NEW_LEDS and CONFIG_LEDS_CLASS (the CONFIG_POWER_SUPPLY will be enabled automatically)

PS: I got the cheapest xbox controller out there (since I know nothing about xbox) to test, but apparently it is ""type-s"", meaning non-usb so if anybody has any ideas about how do I make it USB - let me know.

TeslaMotors,complaint,9l9e2c,Model 3 LR RWD review from a car enthusiast.,"
**Background :**

I've held my model 3 reservation for a while and I wanted some alone time with the car to decide if I really liked it. So I decided to rent a model 3 LR RWD for a day and wrote down some of my thoughts from the perspective of a car enthusiast. I'm going to steal some formatting from /u/cookingboy 's [model 3 review](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/85ajxa/a_detailed_review_of_model_3_from_a_m3_owner/) since I have a habit of rambling. Before I begin my review I'll provide some background about myself. Normally I wouldn't include this stuff. But, there are a lot of people out there who claim Tesla fans are inexperienced in the realm of luxury and performance cars. So I thought I would include some context to help dispel some of that.

 I've been a huge car enthusiast as long as I can remember. I spent much of my youth wrenching on cars with my father and have been hooked ever since. I' m at some car event or working on one of my cars pretty much every weekend. I read about cars, watch videos about cars, and listen to podcasts about cars for hours every day. It's fair to say I'm a bit obsessed. So far I've owned an 85' Jaguar XJS 12, E46 BMW 325Ci, 2016 Mustang Ecoboost, 1991 Mazda Miata, 2006 Corvette Z06, 1993 Mazda Miata, 1991 Mazda Miata, 2011 BMW 335i, and most recently a 95' Civic. Currently, I still have the Z06, the 335i, and the Civic.  I've modified and raced pretty much every car I've owned. They're all pretty impractical, but I can't stand driving a boring car. Along with the cars I've owned, I've driven a huge variety of cars and a few of the competitors. I've driven everything from brand new Lamborghinis to base model Ford Fiestas. 

I've been a pretty big EV fan since the Tesla Roadster. The first EV I ever drove was a 2013 LEAF. Before that, I was certainly interested in electric cars. But I didn't entirely understand the appeal. A soon as I drove the LEAF, I finally understood what it's all about.  Sure it's not the fastest or most exciting car out there. But the responsiveness gives you a really good idea of what EVs are like Since then I've been following Tesla pretty closely. Also for full disclosure, I've been in $TSLA since January of 2016. I also reserved a Model 3 in March of 2016. Since then I've driven a Model S P100D, a P85D, and had a short drive in a Model 3 LR RWD. 

**Drivetrain** :

The drivetrain is easily the best part of the car. Without it, I wouldn't even consider the Model 3. The Model 3 isn't the fastest or quickest thing I've ever driven. But it feels fast. Without any gauges in your face or any engine noise, you just get this pure sense of acceleration. Around town, it's super addicting to just blast away from a light. The best part about the drivetrain isn't the acceleration itself. It's how little fuss there is to extract performance. There is no downshifting or anything. You just put your foot down and it just rockets forward no questions asked. Even though I was driving a RWD model, the acceleration when you exit a corner is hilariously fun. 

I really only have 2 complaints with the drivetrain. It might seem contradictory because I just praised it for it's no fuss nature. But the drivetrain doesn't have enough drama for me. I can certainly appreciate the drama-free nature of the Model 3's drivetrain. But it just doesn't excite me as much as some ICEs. In a good ICE I get tons of feedback from the car alongside the acceleration. In my Z06 I can hear the engine screaming to redline. I can feel the tires struggling for traction. I can feel the transmission clunking into the next gear. It's a challenge to drive and it scares the shit out of me, which I love. Compared to this the Model 3 felt a little sterile. It felt like I was playing on easy mode.  Obviously, this is just how fixed gear EVs are. But it kinda took away some of the fun factor. 

My second issue it acceleration at higher speeds. For example, from a standing start, the Model 3 would probably eat my 335i alive. But from a 50-roll the 335i feels like it has more pull. 



**Steering**:

I was actually kinda surprised by the steering. IMO it's better than most of its competitors. It was super responsive and not as digital feeling as I imagined. It still has that numb feeling that you get from most EPS cars. But it's not bad at all. It's closer to my 335i, which is praised for its great steering than it is a new 340i. 

**Suspension/Chassis** :

This is another really good point for the Model 3. Due to that low COG, it felt super planted at all times.  Even in hard cornering, there is impressively little body roll for a car of this weight. When I drove the Model S I got this super weird feeling during mid-corner bumps where it feels like the car almost floats for a second. It was super weird and I didn't like it at all. This feeling is 100% absent in the Model 3. The suspension and chassis setup also makes the car really easy to drive. In a corner, it just takes smooth inputs and the car will do exactly what you want it to do. It's really hard to upset the car without going crazy.  The turn in was also very impressive for a car of this size/weight. It felt like the car rotated from the driver's seat rather than from the front like in a lot of cars. Overall I was very impressed and happy with the suspension and chassis setup. 


**Interior feel**:


When I first stepped into a model 3 I was just surprised by the super open an barren interior. I'm familiar with Teslas. But the Model 3 really stood out in this regard. At first, it was a little jarring. But as I drove and adjusted to it I grew to like it. The low hood and lack of a gauge cluster make the view out front great. With the exception of the rear, the visibility all around the car was great. Combined with the glass roof, it felt like driving a big fishbowl. The seats were very comfortable but lacked a little bolstering. In quicker turns, I had to brace myself with my knees a bit. The steering wheel looked a little goofy, but I enjoyed how thick and simple it was. There was more than enough storage space and I loved the phone dock. Overall I feel like this would be an incredibly great car to drive on a daily basis. It's comfortable, it's quiet, and it's very practical. I could easily see myself driving this car on long road trips. 

You guys are going to hate me for this, but I just wish it had a few more physical controls. I'm not talking something like [this](https://img.indianautosblog.com/2016/07/Mercedes-AMG-SLC-43-buttons-launched-in-India.jpg). But something closer to [this](http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2959481.1485789728!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_750/nydn-2017-volvo-s90-t6-inscription-sensus-infotainment-system-screen.jpg). I just wish it had a  knob for fan speed, a knob for volume, and regular vents. The vents just felt like a complicated solution to a problem that didn't exist. I don't mind if all the other stuff is on the touchscreen.


**Tech**: 
I'm a little mixed on this topic. I really enjoyed the big responsive screen, AP, and other little things. It really shows how different Tesla's approach to car infotainment is than other manufacturers. Everything just looked super good. It also just feels a lot more natural to use than the menu digging that you have to go through in other systems. The sound system isn't on the level of some of the higher end stuff. But I found it to be pretty good. 

With all that said, I still felt like it was missing some of the stuff that you find in other much cheaper cars. Stuff like Android Auto, HUD (Seriously, my 12 year-old Chevy has this), 360 camera, or blind spot monitors. It's really weird that these things aren't even available in what is supposed to be one of the highest tech cars available. The phone integration just didn't feel as seamless as what I get with Android Auto. 



**Will I buy a Model 3?** :

Even after driving the Model 3 I'm still undecided. While I really enjoyed the car and could definitely see myself driving one, I'm still not sure if it's worth it for me. Fun is the most important thing for me when buying a car. The Model 3 was certainly fun. But, I don't feel like it was $50k worth of fun. This isn't exclusive to the Model 3. I drove the 340i and S5 Sportback and came out feeling the same way. I'll reassess my feelings when the SR Model 3 is available at that magic price point. But hopefully, the used market is pretty good in the coming years. 


Tl;DR: 

Great powertrain but a little too drama free. Fantastic chassis and suspension for a car this heavy. Comfortable interior but lacking a few things. Great tech but also lacking a few things. Good all around car.

TeslaMotors,complaint,b31kmx,Quietest Tesla configuration for someone with hearing loss,"Hey everyone, I am in the market for a Tesla because like most of you I love the tech and totally enjoyed driving everything I've tested. Is there a particular configuration of car that has the lowest cabin noise? I have tinnitus and this makes it hard to hear people when I'm not looking at them. For example, I have a Mitsubishi Lancer right now and it's nearly impossible for me to carry on a conversation in the car. 

I've driven all the Teslas at some point or another but before I spend, was wondering if there was a certain configuration that led to the least NVH/lowest noise. Bigger wheels? Smaller wheels? Premium interior vs standard? Etc. 

I've heard some complaints that the Model 3 is pretty loud on highways and over rough road compared to the S and X, but not exactly sure just how much louder since I've not driven any of them back to back. I didn't have much trouble carrying on conversation with a friend when I drove the X, but have only driven a 3 on surface streets (never on a freeway). Obviously any of these will be significantly quieter than what I'm driving now, but just want to make sure I'm getting max quiet factor from whichever model I end up going with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/b31kmx/quietest_tesla_configuration_for_someone_with/,kolnidur,65529.0,0.9511
TeslaMotors,complaint,hyykxw,Evolution of displayed range with updates and hardware evolution,"Lets just clarify the fact that this is not a complaint post, I'm just really data driven and would like to understand everything a little more.

I bought my Model 3 LR AWD last year (May 2019), at that time, the announced range for that trim was 499km (sorry fellow Americans :P ). Now, I know the displayed range is a function of the battery charge and EPA rating with the calculated energy remaining and is affected by battery degradation. Honestly I always use % but I like to check from time to time to see the evolution.

Recently I got a pretty sudden drop in ""full"" range which surprised me because it happened all at once but its not stressing me out. (Went from 498km full to about 478km full, I have 21000km driven)

What is interesting to me is that the displayed range does not seem to be linear with my observations

* 100% -> 478km
* 50% -> 246km (would expect 239km)
* 10% -> 50km (wait what? if you extrapolate my full battery would be 500km?)

When I saw that I started looking into it and saw lots of things about the BMS and calibration so I decided to give it a try (drop battery to \~5% and charge to 100%) but no change at all.

After that another thing that was interesting to me is the change of advertised range on new models. At some point last year Tesla updated the range on LR AWD to 518km. I thought that this was an hardware improvement and did not expect any change on my car. However I was talking with someone with a 2018 LR AWD and this person now has a range of 513km so I was wondering if someone else had this ""bump"" via software and should I have expected it?

I'm very interested to hear about your experiences!",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hyykxw/evolution_of_displayed_range_with_updates_and/,fosomo,186.0,0.9789

TeslaMotors,complaint,8bjg41,Tesla Model 3 rental - my thoughts/pics/vid,"**Preface**

A friend and I both are day 1 reservation holders, and as we anxiously await our invites, we decided it would be fun to rent a Model 3 for a day via Turo.  So we split a rental for a day and dedicated the entire time to driving around and checking out the various features.  I typed up some of my impressions after spending an entire day focused on the Model 3.  Here is a link to some pix I took, including some isometric shots and a cool aerial overhead circle video with a drone: [link](https://1drv.ms/f/s!Ah_tUBDR6iIWaFUYqmW8XG0r3ns).

**First impressions**

I'll break down some of my thoughts on the car overall, including high points, nit picks, and everything in between.

**The car itself - quick notes**

Ignoring all the electronics and Tesla-specific bits, the raw question is:  how does the Model 3 fare as a car?   The answer thankfully is, great!  The Model 3 is a really enjoyable car to drive - the ride quality, feel/handling, seat comfort, and overall package is just a driver's dream.  It handles extremely well and feels like it grips the road perfectly.   The balance is superb, no noticeable body-roll during turns, and it handles a full pedal-to-the-metal punch from the line without any slip.  And when you punch it, you feel it.   It's not blow your socks off acceleration, but it beats the average car out there for sure, with a good amount of push-you-back feeling due to the instant torque that make EVs so fun.  

The steering is very tight in sport mode, and it feels exactly how I like.   The comfort steering is pretty 'sloppy' feeling, and standard is, well, actually pretty standard.  It's great they include those options, but I know personally I'll be sticking with the sport setting.

It looks great too.  Pictures dont really do it justice, it looks so much better in person. Sleek, modern, but not too sci-fi or out there.   I didnt notice any bad panel gaps/etc with the one I had.  The lines and style really just work well, and the size is perfect.   

The interior is acceptable, but not outstanding.  The seats are very comfortable, but as I feared, the lack of buttons feels like a hindrance for a lot of tasks.   More on all that below.

**The normal things**

With any new car, there are certain pieces you will compare with other cars, regardless if they are EV, ICE, compacts or SUVs, some things are universal.    So these are things I always try pay attention to, because during the excitement of checking out a new vehicle, the basics can sometimes be overlooked.   Here are a few items I specifically wanted to check out on the Model 3, in comparison with general standards

**Comfort** 

First, the seats.  The front seats are very comfortable - much nicer than I expected for this class of car.  They are bolstered just perfectly for me, not too sliding but also still providing good support without that feeling of getting stabbed in the sides from overly huggy wings. 

The back seats have a surprising amount of head room - but sadly are really no good for adults with long legs.  If the front seat is pushed back a bit, there is no leg room, as to be expected - but there is also basically zero room for feet/toes under the seat either, they are almost all the way to the ground.   On top of that, the seat height is also much too low - I'd expect a normal seat to support the thighs up to the knee, but my legs were inches above the actual seat.    I'd never want to be a passenger in the back for anything longer than a ride to lunch or something.  But for kids (or people with shorter legs), it should be fine.

I like the steering wheel.  It's got a good thickness and it's small enough to feel sporty.   The location of the scroll wheels work well, though were often covered by my palms when just driving.  But at least I never felt like they were accidentally moving.   The bottom of the wheel (6 o'clock position) seems a little bulky because there is nothing on it.   Seems like it should have a little hole or something.  But that's small potatoes - overall it feels good and gets the job done fine, just nothing fancy about it.

How easy is it to get in and out of the car?  well, for the front seats, its fine.  Typical entry/exit quality for a mid-sized sedan.  The back seats though are another story.   They are much more awkward and the headroom (while fine sitting) doesnt leave much room for exiting due to the back curve of the roof - taller fellas such as myself need a little more care on getting out.   I do really love the pushbutton to open the door (from the inside) rather than needing to pull a handle. 

The A/C worked really well - kept the car ice cold in some warm weather.  Adjustable vents were pretty cool, but 

**Sunvisor**

Something I dont often see talked about much of is how the sunvisors are on a car.  To me, this is an important bit that is often overlooked.  I'm happy to say that the Model 3 sunvisor hits all the right boxes -  When flipped down in front, it covers pretty much the entire area needed.   And as importantly, when swung out to the side window, it can extend to cover the ENTIRE window, which is often rare in cars.   For example, in my BMW i3, the tiny sunvisor barely covers even half the side window glass, making it almost useless in certain sun scenarios.  Conversely, a 2001 Cadillac SLS I owned had the most amazing visors -  not only did they swing out and extend, but it also had an additional flip-down piece of plastic for the windshield so you could have both side and front covered, which was great for those windy roads when the sun is in that sweetspot near the A pillar.  Anyway, I was pleased with the Model 3's visor being a step above average.

**Rearview Mirror**

Sadly, the rearview mirror on the Model 3 feels oddly undersized.  I'm not sure if that is intentional because the view out of the rear window is small, but it feels like it should be at least another 2-4"".   It also wasnt 'fancy'.  Not that it has to be, but for example the Bolt has a switch on the mirror that actually turns it into the rear camera!   I couldnt even tell if the Model 3 had auto-dimming features, because there were no indications of it being anything other than a piece of glass, and of course no switches or buttons on it.

**Visibly**

This one feels like a tossup.   When turning my head to look out windows or the rear, everything is fine, no issues.   But I found both the side mirrors and rearview mirror lacking on the visibility front.   I did not feel like i was getting a great view from either, in comparison to an average car's mirrors.   Having such a big screen for the backup camera though is really great, since you get a clearer picture - which can be sometimes harder to see details on other smaller car screens.   All said, it was an acceptable combo and I didnt feel like there was really an issue seeing overall, but could use improvement on the mirror fronts.

**Turning radius**

I found the turning radius totally acceptable.   It wasnt outstanding, nor was it poor - solidity average.  Not really much more to say on that front.

**Headlights**

Another short and sweet one - they work great, and really light up the road like most quality modern lights do, maybe even better than avg.  No complaints.

**Storage space**

The trunk has a nice amount of room, plus the extra little compartment underneath could be handy for when you need a lot of extra space, or want to store emergency road kits/etc out of the way.  It requires a bit of slam to shut all the way, but that's fine, as it has some heft.  The frunk is small, but gets the job done for like a big backpack, or grocery bags.  Supposedly it's sized to fit a carry-on luggage bag.    The frunk isnt the easiest thing to close though - it takes bit more oomph than I'd expect, which wouldnt matter except for the fact it seems a bit fragile - it's even recommended to close with 2 hands. 

**The Tesla/EV bits**

Tesla and EVs in general are in a special class when it comes to certain driving dynamics and features.  Here I'll try to talk specifically about those things.  

**1 pedal driving**

One of the EV specific things is 1-pedal driving (1PD), which I absolutely love.  The 1PD in the Model 3 is solid.  While it doesnt have *quite* the aggressive stopping power as the i3, it does the job well.   And I love the fact you can adjust if if you want, tho I'd never turn it down to the less intense setting myself.   My only real complaint about the 1PD is it wont come to a complete stop.   My favorite thing about my i3 is I can commute to work and sometimes never even need to use the brake pedal once (including freeway offramps!).   The Model 3 seems to peter out around 8-ish mph, it will slowwwly decrease from there but not enough to not require using the brakes at a stop.

**The Screen**

No doubt the most controversial piece of the Model 3 is the lack of physical buttons, replaced by a single central screen that contains pretty much everything.  It is both really cool, and also annoying.  The extreme minimalist nature of the interior is somewhat refreshing, but also leaves a bit of frustration when it comes to the basics.   Tasks that were simple and easy in a normal car, now require multiple taps and menu selections to accomplish - such as adjusting the mirrors, HVAC vents - even opening the glovebox.

The screen looks great though.  And it's nice and solidly mounted to the dash, doesnt have any wobble at all.    I was able to rest my hand on it during bumpier roads to be able to hit the proper spot on the screen.   The speedometer is very easy to read and always available, and I only caught myself maybe once or twice looking down at the dash where it would normally be located.  It was an easy adjustment.   

The map is also very nice and snappy, and the navigation works great.  Using the click-in on the right scrollwheel to activate voice control was very easy, and it worked perfectly every time I used it to route somewhere.   There were a few occasions I had trouble getting the map screen to show up again however, due to some other menus or submenus being open.   There is no dedicated on-screen button to take you back to the maps immediately, which was disappointing.  There were also a few times when the map just went blank because it was unable to pull data - This was a big bummer.  I'd expect it to cache the local areas for this reason.  

One thing I dont think will change (for me) is the desire for a dedicated map button.   On multiple occasions I was unable to back out to just the map screen w/out first figuring out which menus to cancel out of to get it to show again.   And yet there are dedicated buttons for both front seat heaters?   You can already get to those with a press of the center HVAC button.   Seems like a waste of screen real estate.

Getting to all the standard car controls takes a click or two on the ""car"" screen, which I'm sure will be second nature once the car is owned for a bit of time.  But some things weren't all that intuitive to find, requiring swipes in one area or selecting a option in another, and backing out of menus to get to certain things.   The UI is really good and snappy, so once everything is memorized it probably wont be as big a deal.  It just was not as obvious as I'd expect, which would make it troublesome for someone not experienced with the car to drive it in an emergency. 

The music selection screens are pretty decent.  I did not mess around a ton here, but it was able to find songs and such without issue, and the default genres were decent.  I can only image this gets a lot better as you tap into your own music subscriptions, but even the default Tesla stuff had a ton available.

I like the ability to save up to 5 driver profiles.  So if you have a friend that may drive the car on a regular basis but not someone who'd have the app on their phone, you can just select the profile and easily switch to restore settings like seat positions and all that.  

I didnt really play with the wipers since it wasnt raining, but I'm hoping by the time rainy season starts some software update will add wiper features to the wheel.  Of course, assuming I can actually get mine before then, hah. 

Overall I do like the screen, and I think after some longer term usage when things become second nature, most of the issues wont be as big a deal.

**The door handles**

The new funky door handles are both cool and gimmicky.  Mostly the latter.  They do look sleek, and they certainly are not difficult to open, but they do require a slight extra effort.  It require a push, grab, and pull rather than just a grab'n'pull single motion for a normal handle.  The push actually pops open the door a bit electronically, essentially the same function that pressing the interior button does.   But from the inside you simply just push the door open.

**The key card**

Unfortunately, since this was a rental I was not able to try out the app, which I've heard works great.  The keycard is functional, but not really that convenient.  Quite a few times it did not recognize properly and required addition attempts to tap.  On the bright side, once you start the car, you dont have to leave it sitting on the center console.

**Range accuracy**

I was happy that the range indicator seemed to really line up with the actual range of the car.  That instills confidence for planning any longer trips.

**AutoPilot**

I've experienced AutoPilot before in a Model S, but I really got to put the Model 3 through the ropes during my full day with it.   It's both amazing and so-so at the same time.  And I'll explain that.    First off, the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is by far the best part of the AutoPilot.   Which, while it worked amazingly, doesnt really stand out from the crowd - due to that feature being available in most modern cars these days as an option or part of a safety package.  However, it doesnt make it any less great even if it is common.

The auto-steering is the other half of the equation.   This part is both really cool, and a little bit of not-quite-there-yet.    When it works well, it is really incredible to just have the car make the turns for you.  The automatic lane changing feature is pretty neat too, though since you still really need to pay attention to the available openings, it's not something that seemed to be as useful as it could be.   What wasnt so great is the fact the AP would turn itself off a lot when it got confused, such as near side barriers, or in certain lane situations.   Not a huge deal because I was always paying attention, but it's easy to see how one might get complacent after using AP a long time.   I also found it really tended to hug the left line closely in a lot of the cases, which made me a little uncomfortable because it was too close to traffic in the other lane.   Other times it stayed almost in the center, so I'm only guessing the different behavior had to do with the types of painted lines it was following.

I think EAP is a no-brainer for folks with a lot of freeway commuting, because it will take a lot of the effort out of the annoying parts of those drives.   Doesnt really apply for 90% of my use case though, so I'll likely be skipping.   Just really bummed the ACC doesnt come standard, but since I'd maybe use it at most 4-5 times a year, I can live w/out it.

**Supercharging**

Not a ton to say here, other than it is very fast, and if there's a spot open near a place you want to stop, very convenient.   Stopping to charge up while grabbing a bite to eat worked perfectly, especially in my case because the SC was right next to the stop I wanted to make for lunch anyway.    Granted that wont always be the case, but for this outing, it was perfect.  My typical use of this car will rarely involve supercharging, but its great to know the option is there and works well.

**The nit picks**

And now for some complaints.  I'm not really going to hold back even tho I'm a fan of both Tesla and the Model 3, but I dont think any of these complaints are really unfair either.  Of course opinions will vary, but these are mine, and what matter to me.

**Interior**

The 5K ""premium"" option honestly does not feel really all that premium, especially without being able to compare it to the currently vaporware base.  But, it is easy to compare to other cars.  The seats are great, so that is a real reason to spring for it, along with the center console (because apparently the base has nothing at all?).  The headliner material and soft plastic parts on the doors feel solidly mid-range to me.  Having owned or driven cars across the spectrum, nothing in the Model 3 feels like a major upgrade really.   The center console is fine, tho the phone dock was disappointing as it would not fit my Pixel 2 with a case on it, so I'll have to use a different solution there. Touches like the suede-ish inner door liner are nice enough, but overall... just not feeling the value.  Since the base interior is still unknown, its hard to know how much of an upgrade all the things really are.  The base almost feels (by description) that they are ripping out pieces simply to force people into the PUP config just to get the basics.  Granted, part of that 5K includes the stereo and glass roof too, but actually these are my biggest complaints.

The stereo is mediocre for an 'upgrade'.   Compared to the kicker system in my 2010 Challenger, the Model 3 doesnt hold up at all, especially at a higher volume.  And it's barely better than the base system in my i3.   I played the same songs I would normally play and it just was not as rich or full sounding, no matter what setting it was on (I tried all the settings, including maxing the bass and enabling all the immersive sound toggles).   I'm not one to blast my music so it's less of a big deal personally, but considering this was considered an upgrade, color me not impressed.   Which also makes me wonder what the base stereo will be like, maybe front speakers only or something?

My biggest gripe is the glass roof.  I am sure many people really like it, but I found the glare from the sun to be annoying and distracting.  And the fact this is bundled with the premium upgrade really sucks, because I'd honestly still rather pay that 5K upcharge with the option to NOT have the glass roof at all, especially considering it doesnt even open.   I get combining options for ease of production, but if there's one thing that should be its own optional component, it is the roof.   Now I feel like I'll be forced to buy a special shade for a 'feature' I already did not want to buy in the first place, which just feels wrong on so many levels.

**The screen**

I mentioned most of this already in the screen section, but there are a lot of aspects about not having physical switches that I found annoying.  The lack of a dedicated map button and yet wasted space with multiple seat heater buttons seemed like an odd choice.  I'm sure over time this will be less of a thing, but it confirmed my concerns that current easy-to-perform tasks in a normal car now require an extra level of effort that shouldnt be necessary.   I also hope some software update down the road will give you the ability to customize a couple of the less critical dedicated buttons.

**Overall**

My overall thought is, the Model 3 is a definite winner. The quirks and complaints pale in comparison to how enjoyable the car is to drive.  While there are some things I'd definitely prefer were done differently, it is a solid car and once they get production figured out, will likely be a hot seller at the SR trim level for those looking to purchase in that range.  Given this is a PUP model, I'm still really curious what the base interior will be like.

**postface**

Some background on where my thoughts are coming from:   I have owned a wide variety of vehicles over the years, from vintage classics to modern EVs, and anywhere in between - and I've driven far beyond that.  I have spent many hours behind the wheel of both the 3 series BMW line, as well as different EVs, which by all accounts is solid Model 3 territory.   My current daily driver is a BMW i3, which I've been leasing for the last 3 years.  I also have a SRT Challenger that I drive less frequently - basically opposite ends of the spectrum (full electric compact vs a massive v8 car w/ a 6sp manual).   Both are great fun in their own ways.  Since my original Model 3 order window was delayed, I extended my i3 lease by 5mo - so I'm hoping to get the Model 3 before it runs out again!

TeslaMotors,complaint,a8byaq,I received my Taptes Model 3 Wireless Qi Charger,"Let me know if you have any questions about it. I'll do my best to answer.

I have a Pixel 3 so because it only supports ""Charging Rapidly"" with the Pixel Stand so I don't have a way to test the max speed of the charger. It does clock in around 500 mA according to Ampere. Decent enough for the convenience. Pixel Stand charges at 1600 mA or so just for comparison.

My wife's iPhone X does not ""double ding"" to indicate fast charging but still charges at a decent rate as well.

I don't have experience with Nomad to compare against but this was only $50 compared to $130. I ordered on November 15 and I received it on December 20. It was help up at LAX customs for about a week. No regrets with it so far. The ease and convenience of taking it in and out without wiggling and struggling with the charge port totally worth it.

Also one of the main complaints I heard about Nomad was that the USB cables were too short to lift the charger up to get into the compartment or even connect the cables.

The process to get the car is what caused some high BP.

They informed us they were ""10 minutes behind schedule"".  11:15 comes, and a rep explains that there still a bit behind, and that maybe we could just start with our paperwork.  11:40, and the same gentleman comes and asks ""how comfortable are you with the car?  Can we skip the orientation to save time?"".  The car was bought for my fiance' who definitely needed the ""hand holding"" to avoid getting overwhelmed by the large (beautiful) 15"" display.  11:50, and they bring a customer service member who came and gave a quick orientation on the showroom floor model.  12:00 we begin to sign the paperwork.  12:15 paperwork finished, now just need to finalize the trade in.  12:20 customer service member comes and notifies us that ""they forgot to charge the car last night"" (and apparently this morning) and there is only 12% of the battery left.  12:45  we finalize the trade in paperwork.  12:50 we leave (with around 140 miles of range which is not much living in freezing weather). 

&#x200B;

The Tesla dealership was incredible unorganized.  They were not apologetic, seemed to show next to zero concern about our time, and overall were just very sloppy.  At one point they lost our keycards, and took about 15 minutes to find them..

&#x200B;

We spent close to $60,000 on this car.  The car is worth every penny.  The actual pickup experience was a shit show.

&#x200B;

The least they could have done was offer my fiance and I a coffee mug or a tshirt or something :/


Edit: We can all agree it's worth the wait. And we can all agree that they need to streamline the delivery process . Tesla- feel free to let me know if you need a delivery  process designed and implemented...Process design and implemention is kinda what allowed me to buy the Tesla in the first place üòâ",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/a4wjbh/tesla_model_3_delivery_experience/,Alshad,20264.0,0.974
TeslaMotors,complaint,5xwq3x,A friends' Tesla died today,"From the way he told it, he was speeding up on the German autobahn, when suddenly out of nowhere a loud bang sound came from the motor, and the the car just died. He was able to coast it to the side of the road, but was unable to get it started again. The dash showed a ""car needs service"" notice.

Do these things happen more often?

He called Tesla and they told him they'd bring him a loaner and pick up the stopped car right away, so no complaints about their service.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/5xwq3x/a_friends_tesla_died_today/,Grei-man,6748.0,0.0526
TeslaMotors,complaint,gf28ff,Maps vs Cameras: Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control,"Interesting experience using traffic light and stop sign control today that I think confirms the maps AP is using are generated from the fleet. If this was already widely known, my apologies for stating the obvious - I know Tesla had used a 3rd party source for parking lot maps for a while.

My neighborhood has an art supply store that occasionally hangs a pretty convincing fake stop sign from the front of their store and into the sidewalk (not into the street). It actually says something like ‚Äústop here for deals.‚Äù I haven‚Äôt seen it for several months, possible they got complaints. I remember thinking almost a year ago that I would be interested to see what an autonomous vehicle would think about the sign.

Taking my newly updated (12.11.1) model 3 out tonight I learned a few things:

1) even though the sign wasn‚Äôt out tonight, the car responded as though it was and attempted to stop (others have experienced something similar when a REAL stop sign that is supposed to be at an intersection goes missing).

2) we already know that the auto-stop uses a combination of vision and maps to determine stop sign placement - as others have posted video of the car stopping for hand-held stop signs.

3) this stop sign almost certainly wouldn‚Äôt have shown up on any other 3rd party map software since a) it‚Äôs not a real stop sign and b) is only in that location every once in a while. I would say that makes it very likely that the latest maps have been coming from fleet vision for several months

It will be interesting to see the response to these strange edge cases evolve. Hopefully this phantom stop sign gets removed once I accelerate through it enough times via an eventual map update.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/gf28ff/maps_vs_cameras_traffic_light_and_stop_sign/,outsideman1986,2599.0,0.6163
TeslaMotors,complaint,be2b3u,Feature request: dual thermostat set points,"Also a bit of a air-conditioning rant on the model 3.

Maybe I'm just picky, but when I go to work in the morning, it's cool outside but not so cold I want the heater on. (mid-lower 60s).  I do want a little bit of air flow, because it gets stuffy otherwise.

When I come home, it's warm (mid-upper 80s) and getting hotter, so I want the AC on but I don't need it super low because it isn't that humid.

In the morning, it thinks I want 75, so it blasts the heater until I turn the AC off (and, I think, the set point down to the mid 60s so it wont turn the heater on)

In the evening, it thinks I want it mega super cold, so I have to go adjust it again.

**It would really be nice to have a 'not colder than this, not warmer than this' way to set the thermostat...just like my house.**

Also, I'm honestly not sure when the heater is on (is it when AC is button is blue?  or any time the fan is on and the set point is higher than the internal temperature?).  It would be really nice to have a separate button for the heater or a clear indication of it being on/off.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/be2b3u/feature_request_dual_thermostat_set_points/,Schnort,153217.0,0.979
TeslaMotors,complaint,33ndlp,New Tesla+Roadtrip = List of nitpicks,"At the end of March, I got my S85D, and it's amazing! Last week I started up a road trip from Santa Cruz, CA, USA up to Calgary, AB, Canada. I didn't experience any problems and had a great trip.

So, here's a list of things I'd like to see in future software updates:

* TACC: The ""overtake accelleration"" should not come into effect if the faster lane has nobody anywhere behind you.
* The Minimap lane indicator overlay in the dashboard totally sucks. In this case, I'm referring to the drawing that shows you what lane you should be in to take an offramp. It comes on way too soon, it doesn't tell you which exit you should take based on its location, and having to read what it says and match it with the roadsigns is not nearly as helpful as it just saying ""take the exit in 100 meters"" which is best expressed as just *a map*, which that part of the dash was already displaying before the minimap decides to cover the map with the stupid overlay. My complaints wouldn't even be reduced if it were 100% accurate, which it's definitely not.
* On any map display, the ""you are here"" arrow's point should be your location, as opposed to the arrow's center. It is hard to tell where you are in relation to the road when the arrow is covering that part of the map.
* That arrow's direction should point in the direction the car is facing (or possibly the direction of the wheels), as opposed to the direction the car's motion. This is especially useful when you're making sharp turns and could help eliminate some of the ""map is out of date with reality"" problem.
* Voice control should respond to things like ""activate fog lights"".
* Show altitude next to your current location on touchscreen, because, why not.
* TACC: The maximum follow distance (setting 7) is far too close. Sometimes I just wanna cruise all by myself. If you don't see a car immediately in front of you, *gradually* accellerate to the cruise control's speed setting. If a car was in front of you and it goes out of view due to a turn, assume it hasn't sped up and keep on cruising at that speed for a while.
* Be a lot more gradual about accelleration in general with cruise control. Especially at setting 7. Be a lot more gradual about decelleration as well, slowing down by being ""neutral"" is more energy efficient than hitting the regenerative brakes, and results in a smoother drive.
* TACC: If a turn is coming, don't accellerate until you're halfway through it.
* Have an additional song ready to play with Slacker radio, so you don't have to wait for another to download.
* Slacker should automatically pick its quality setting, otherwise you always have to change the setting based on your internet connectivity.
* The map should let me search for things on the way to my destination like ""coffee that's between here and the next supercharger"".
* The battery estimation should at least notice that I consistently exceed the speed limit by a certain amount, and estimate my battery consumtion for this leg of the journey by considering that.
* The shift ""key"" on the on-screen-keyboard should only stick for the one following letter. It should not be a caps-lock. This is so annoying.
* When you pause the music, and leave the car, when you return to the car and the computer wakes up, it starts playing again.
* Please, Please, **Please**. *Let me pick different units for distance and speed.* Let's say I'm a normal American and am driving in Canada (or a Briton driving in Europe) and the speed limit signs show km/h - I would still want my navigation to tell me to continue on the ""Trans-Canada Highway"" for 100 miles (as opposed to km), right? Please.

TeslaMotors,complaint,313yb9,Upgraded from Lexus LS460 to Model S 85D- the good and bad of the first 10 days,"I just upgraded from Lexus LS460 AWD to a Model S 85D and absolutely no regrets. The MS is an amazing car. With that said, there are issues which, no doubt, have been listed several times in various threads.  

This is not a 1:1 comparison but relevant issues which stood out in the first 10 days of swapping cars.    Coming from a ""luxury"" sedan, I made several assumptions of what to expect much like  expecting a backup camera.  

The less than great:

- the MS is wider than the 460 by 4"".  The garage just got a little tighter on the sides but I gained ~4"" in depth. I always back into the garage and the 4"" actually threw off my routine to maximize driver door space.

- The MS has no storage in the cabin other than the small glove box and a thin slot below the main screen. No door pockets, no armrest compartment, no behind the seat compartments, and no sunglasses storage.  I highly recommend the official Tesla center consoles for front and back. The rear seat center console is user installed/uninstalled in less than a minute.  The front console requires service center install. Each of these are about $600.  Second gen seats do not have the small ""hidden"" pocket in the front. Evannex claims to be working on backseat ""kangaroo"" pockets but no clue what will be involved or the cost. 

- Drink holders are horribly placed.  The center console fixes this problem with slightly unorthodox adjustable cup holders. Plenty of room for two big gulps if you need it.

- EZPass doesn't work in the cabin and radar detectors may not work. The sweet spot to the right of the rearview mirror seems to have been eliminated in at least the D versions (all 2015 versions?).  I placed my exterior type EZPass behind the nosecone.  Works fine in the booth lanes but not so sure about high speed lanes yet.

- The car will lock itself with the key in the car. Hopefully an update can address this. I believe this can be disabled but the car will never lock itself. 
 - Blind spot warning starting with 6.2 has not been overly helpful but this is just an early assessment.  It's better than nothing but I prefer the indicators on the side mirrors.

- The MS does not have sunroof\pano roof shades.  You can buy 2 shades that fit in the roof similar to a fold out sun screen shade ($150 for the set) but plenty of light still comes in. I bought these ahead of time expecting roll back/adjustable shades but they are simply inserted or removed. Rear hatch shade can be purchased for $90.

- While it may be possible to get the advertised max range of ~272 if you drive 60MPH, I'm lucky to get 220 miles on a max charge (I average 75ish).  I have a 100mile commute each way and so far, range anxiety has made me stop at a supercharger in one direction or the other. It's easy enough and right next to a Starbucks.  Understand that cold weather will significantly decrease range.

-  Double check your super charger network if you need it.  I do not think its practical to use anything else (dual charger maybe) on a regular basis.  As far as I can tell, the most likely connection you'll find on the road is a 40amp charger which will give you ~30miles per hour of charge.  And that‚Äôs optimal range so real mileage is closer to 20-22miles per hour. 

- As far as I can tell, the MS has limited slots for storing  radio\XM stations in memory.  I believe the 460 has 18 slots for XM alone. The MS has 6.  Possible upgrade for future release?

- According to Tesla, XM Radio requires a Panoramic roof option.  I've read various opinions on this so your mileage may vary. The main work around seems to be streaming XM from your phone over Bluetooth.

- Visor mirrors are slim and have no lighting. Cheap covers. No visors in the rear.

- Interior lighting is weak without the interior lighting add-on.  I bought nearly all the options but as of my purchase, you had to spend $3500 to get $50 of LED lights along with some interior enhancements. Pass.

- There is no way to give a slight ""toot"" on the horn.  It's all or nothing baby! I would like to have less obnoxious horn since the car is so quiet - just to give pedestrians a heads up without being scary.

- The leather in the MS is not as rich\soft as the 460. 

- No coat hooks above the rear doors.  I guess they don‚Äôt wear suits in California ;)   I bought a pair of aftermarket clip on hooks from Evannex but they only work if you have the pano roof. They have not arrived yet so no verdict. 

- No spare tire but this is likely a non-issue since Tesla will send someone out to repair\replace the tire.  I've been meaning to look up details on how this works. I hope I have a signal if needed.

- Floor mats seem to be of a much lower quality than the 460. 

- The key is not waterproof. In all fairness, I'm not sure the 460 key is waterproof either but it‚Äôs the size of a credit card and lived in my wallet.  I went 5 years without washing the 460 key. I didn‚Äôt go 5 days without washing the MS key. If your key gets wet, take out the battery ASAP, use a hair dryer on it for a few mins, and place in a Ziploc bag with rice for a few days.  My key works again.  

With all that negativity behind us, the Tesla is an amazing car and I haven‚Äôt doubted the purchase one second.  I also haven't doubted the decision to NOT buy the P85D for the insane mode though I'm sure it's amazing.  There are certainly pages of all the great things Tesla has and does but I'll stick to the highlights.

The Awesome: 

- A much improved purchasing experience.
 
- Simply better looking than the 460. Lexus needs to get a new designer! 

- Tons of options and settings which are tied to individual profiles.  10X better than remembering how my seat and mirrors were set.

- The MS is a rocket ship compared to the 460 which is no slouch at 0-60 in 5.4secs.  Tesla must have understated their 0-60 estimate of 5.2secs because it seems much faster.

- 17"" screen. Wow - No need to go on. It‚Äôs ""THE"" thing everyone sees when they get in the car. Very easy to use.  

- I read a review indicating the screen was too bright at night. I like a dark cabin and I've had no complaints with the screen at night.

- TACC is amazing if not a little nerve racking to get used to.  It has made my long commute so much better as traffic can slow to a crawl, speed up, slow down, etc. 

- A friend of mine always said the 460 drove like a couch. The MS is not a couch - its a real sports sedan.

- Like the 460, the MS has an adjustable height option but the MS remembers where you raised the height and automatically does it for you (e.g. high curb going up a driveway). 

- Lots of storage space outside of the cabin (trunk, frunk). While I'm not a big fan of how you must carefully close the frunk, I'll rarely need to use it with all the space in the rear. 

- Lane drift notification through rumbling the steering wheel.  On the first day, I thought there was something wrong with the car but its growing on me.

 - A fully heated steering wheel. The 460 only has about 50% coverage.  

- The second gen seats seem to be on par with the Lexus in regards to comfort and this is a good thing.

- Internet radio (Slacker, In-Tune) is a great feature and will likely result in my cancelling XM Radio.  I need more time to evaluate quality and signal issues. Both cars have good USB support

- The iPhone\Android app is GREAT.  Monitor/set charge, unlock, lock, start up, pre-heat or cool.  A must have.

- Over the air software updates add cool features!  Beware software updates (which you will initiate) may completely black out your screens without notification of what's going on. I expected a progress bar or something so after 2 hours I thought there was a problem.

- And big surprise - no gas and virtually no maintenance.

TeslaMotors,complaint,bzdbw5,Chargepoint vs. Tesla home charger?,"Are there any major differences if I were to use a ChargePoint home charger instead of a Tesla one? My utility company has a deal going that offers a $2,500 rebate on the purchase of an EV plus a home charger, but the catch is that it HAS to be a ChargePoint home station (it also costs $150 more to buy through their required link instead of an Amazon link, but that's a complaint for another day). Then I have to register and I think I have to create a ChargePoint account and provide my credit card (for a home charger??), so that seems like an annoying thing too. 

Will I have the connectivity needed to charge the car? Adapter? Charge rates? I saw it needs a 5-30 plug to plug into the wall (or just hardwire it), but I'm not an electrician so not sure what that would translate into real world for me. 

I thought I would either skimp and not get a home charger or get the Tesla one, but I don't think I can throw away a $2,500 rebate check just for avoiding the purchase of a $650 home charger. It's not the one I would buy, but are there any critical red flags for doing something like this?

TeslaMotors,complaint,7v3b4e,[Discussion] Alternative to Model 3 door handle?,"Almost every video I see has comments/complaints about the door handles on the Model 3.

So, what would be a better alternative to the Model 3's door handle? (I believe in Don't complain unless you have a better idea)

It has to be flush with the car with no indent (leaves out every door handle on 'normal' cars)

It has to be simple.  (No Model S handle with all that complexity)

In theory could do a Model X style handle, pretty much a push button.  But then you'd have to open the door using the inside lip of the door.  Would that be acceptable?  (Personally I'd say no)

You could do a mechanical version of the S door handle.  Walk up to car, push the handle which clicks and pops out, you pull to open the door and then push it back in.  (wow, sounds horribly awkward just typing it)

Would the Hurrican's straight push/pull door handle be more ergonomic?

Personally I think I'll be fine with it as it is now, poke with thumb, pull and step in...

TeslaMotors,complaint,elweh3,Nightmare dealing with service centers,"Not a hater, I love my model 3 and have been excited to drive it for the last year and a half. What happened did dampen my confidence with Tesla service. I had seen posts which outlined the difficulties people have faced with service and had been prepared for a less than exemplary experience when I had to take my car in to replace a cracked windshield. 

On the day of the appointment drive an hr to get to the the location and check in and go over what I was looking to get done and give the insurance details for which I had opened a claim. So far so good. I am told the work would be done by a external team who come in only on certain days of the week. 

Asked for the possibility of a loaner and turned down professionally with options of Uber credits to get me to work and to return at the end of the day to pick up.  No complaints. Mid day I get a call saying there was scheduling issue and the work wouldn‚Äôt be done for at least the next two days. Growing companies with resources focused on changing the world, I can make adjustments for that. Uber credits meanwhile expired so paid $70 to get to the location to pick up. Checked out the work was happy and drove off after again confirming they had all the information they needed to deal with the insurance. 

All this happened on August 2019. 
Fast forward 4 months, I am getting ready to prepare for the holidays and get an email from the service center saying that they were unable to get the money from the insurance provider an that I had to pay the full amount. No explanations on what happened. I see the claim was closed from my insurance, called them to see if I could pay and get it reimbursed, the agent who probably did not understand the scenario gave me a go ahead. I paid and sent the invoice out for reimbursement and promptly got the message ‚Äúwe have already paid the shop and you need to sort it with them for a refund‚Äù. After Back and forth with the service center I found that they had been provided with the Check and had been cleared but was not updated on their end. 

3 weeks out I am still waiting on my refund for over a thousand bucks. The real kicker was that I found that safelite would have come to my workplace or home and done the work for $400 cheaper.

TLDR: ended up paying out of pocket for a job that was already paid for by insurance because of a bookkeeping error

TeslaMotors,complaint,7jp6xk,"If you bought AP1 but got AP2 back in 2016, consider talking to your Attorney General","First, I understand that this is not the process that all owners would like to take, nor is everyone as annoyed by Tesla's behaviors as I am. That's fine, we all have our own experiences and expectations. I don't need to hear that I should just give it up, I'm aware some people prefer to work that way, but that isn't me. For those that are actual owners and frustrated enough to do something, read on. 

First, this is not about trying to get Tesla's engineering to act differently. This is about pressuring Tesla's marketing and sales to not sell things ahead of reality, which they have done repeatedly. 

If you ordered your car when AP1 existed but were delivered an AP2 car, you hit in an interesting transition. When your car was delivered Tesla's website showed the car as having Rain Sensing wipers. The manual on the website listed this as a standard feature. You test drove a car with the feature. Tesla clearly communicated this as a feature of the product.

It's now been over a year since most of these cars were delivered, and this feature still does not exist, and has no timeframe by Tesla. If you've contacted Tesla, you will be told that they are working on it, but have no timeline, and they appreciate your patience, but they have no other solution or remedy for you. 

Additionally, if you ordered AP1, you got an email asking to upgrade to EAP for an additional charge, and listing the additional features you would get with this EAP upgrade. If you bought this upgrade, it's now been a year since you paid and Tesla has not delivered at all on this upgrade, despite these being ""expected"" in December 2016. . In fact, Tesla has not added a single feature to AP2 in over 6 months, and it is still not at AP1 parity, much less having implemented an EAP feature. Tesla encouraged you to buy EAP ahead of time by indicating it would cost more after delivery and it would be available very soon after delivery.

These behaviors are not favorable to the consumer, and are the exact thing consumer protection divisions of state and county AG's are there to help with. So if you're interested in putting some pressure on Tesla to stop the behavior of selling things before they exist, or removing features from vehicles after deposits are made without telling owners, you might want to let your AG know.

Everyone can file in CA/Santa Clara since that's where Tesla is based. You can file with the Santa Clara county AG [HERE](https://www.sccgov.org/forms/home/_layouts/FormServer.aspx?XsnLocation=/forms/home/da/DA_ConsumerComplaintForm.xsn&OpenIn=browser) and the CA state AG [HERE](https://oag.ca.gov/contact/consumer-complaint-against-business-or-company). Tesla's address is: 3500 Deer Creek Road, Palo Alto, CA 94304,(877) 798-3752

For your state, google the AG for your state or county. I did this myself and my AG got back to me within 24 hours and has already started the process of working with Tesla. I'm sure they'll take it even more seriously if they have a group of people, not just an individual.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7jp6xk/if_you_bought_ap1_but_got_ap2_back_in_2016/,beastpilot,89445.0,-0.4249
TeslaMotors,complaint,bmjm84,Model 3 Road Trip PA to New Orleans 12.1 and 12.1.2- Long Post,"Pennsylvania to New Orleans and back

Model 3, Long Range, AWD/Dual Motor, 19‚Äù

Highlights

2,500 mile round trip PA to New Orleans,  

\~25 hours each way, (50 hours total)

2 days of driving each way (4 days total)

5 Supercharger stops each way (10 total).  Note to others, try not to use the Birmingham, AL one, it is right in the middle of highway and bridge construction downtown, very tricky to get to seeing the construction is on almost every street, lots of detour signs everywhere plus you have to pay for parking because it is in a private lot.

1 night of car camping down and 1 back at campground with 50amp service.  I did a previous post on car camping.

Camping mode (temp stays on all night)

Navigate on Autopilot used \~99% of trip

Did not recharge while in New Orleans for 5 days, topped off in Slidell, LA to \~75% before heading into New Orleans to park car for 5 days

Ran Sentry mode each day while in New Orleans

Received Software update prior to leaving ‚Äì 12.1

Received update while there 12.1.2 (Thank you Reddit, saw it on the post and installed it)

Observations:

Again I drove \~99% of trip in NoA.  So nice and it is definitely a better driver than I for such long hrs behind the glass. \~15hrs on first day and \~10hrs on second day, reverse for return trip.

Supercharging stations are a non issue, plenty of super chargers based on the cars navigation system.  Did not use A Better Route Planner, no need.  Oddly if I charged to say 20% arrival at next charging stop, \~3hrs to the next one, after driving for awhile I would check the energy map in the card section and it showed \~25% on arrival at charging station,  Wait, how‚Äôd I gain energy, its kinda flat out there.  This happened with almost every charging stop.  I‚Äôd arrive at a higher charge at the next supercharger than what it said when I disconnect at the last supercharger.  Not complaining, it gave me much more confidence and allowed me to leave at less than 20% arrival figure at my next stop.  I did not charge to 100%.  Ran \~78 mph on highway.  Temps were in the 80‚Äôs.  Very nice, less time at Super Chargers.

Supercharing

Wow, enjoying the faster speed at charging stations, I think it held 500mph to almost the 50% full.  So now you need to be aware when taking a break, you‚Äôll get the 80% note to your phone while you are lollygagging in the store or restaurant or just strolling along.  So glad to see this increase, can‚Äôt wait for the next one.  Also many times on this trip I was the lone Tesla at the charging station.  My car has no friends.  Most I saw at any one supercharger was 2 others.   This is ain‚Äôt California!!!!

Ramp merge lane

On Ramp lane run out markings and drifting to the right.  Wow great improvement there, car started to drift right, caught itself straightened out but at very end it drifted right again.   The last drift right was only slight, so much better, it‚Äôs getting there.   

Trucks in right lane  and phantom breaking

Still a problem, but it calm down a bit.  I was unable to determine when or if it was going to do it.  Could not find any rhyme or reason for why this truck and not any of the next 1 or 10 or 50. Just never knew when or why it would do it.  Previously it was almost to the point of wanting to turn it off before approaching a truck.  Now it only slightly slowed, once or twice as you approach and pass a truck.  You just never knew what truck it would pick to do it.   

Lane change breaking

This is still a real problem.  You are cruising at 77mph, car closes on you doing 80+, you put your signal on to change lanes and it slows down.  Woooaaa!!!  That is not good.  Car or truck is in adjacent lane, you get past the vehicle in adjacent lane, there are no cars in front of your lane or adjacent lane, you signal and it slows down.  Why, would you ever slow down to change lanes.  Doesn‚Äôt do it when there are no cars around, it changes lanes just fine maintaining its speed?  Not fun getting the ‚Äúyou‚Äôre number 1 sign and honking horn from the car behind you.‚Äù

Highway to Highway interchange

Sweet!  Really does this well, signals, enters the lane(s) and heads onto the next highway and turns signal off.  This is working well.

Exits

Mmm!  Some work still needed on this function.  Most of the time it works very nice, others, not so good.  When it is working it signals, smoothly changes lane and exits on the ramp.  When it is not, oh boy, hold on, this is gonna get good.  Signal comes on, Panic...Dive right and accelerate, wait, over shot, Dive left, wait, over shot, dive back right.  Ok, boys I‚Äôll take over from here.  Luckily there was no State Trooper nearby else I would be looking at careless or reckless driving.  Hopefully by my manually intervening the system will report it back in the Tesla data collection.  I also experienced one where it took the exit fine, but all of the sudden changed its mind and decided to go back onto the highway.  Yikes.   That incident was under one of the Version 8.x updates, thank  goodness didn‚Äôt do it on 12.1 or 12.1.2 during this trip.

Jerkyness during drive

I think this maybe part of phantom breaking but greatly reduced.  You‚Äôll be cruising along just fine,  there are cars in front of you when it happens, get a momentary slow down and release, then another, usually two or three in a row in very short succession and then it‚Äôs fine again.  Apparently the sensor is picking something up that I can‚Äôt see.  Maybe the car in front of the car directly in front of me is doing something it doesn‚Äôt like.  It‚Äôs similar to the truck on right issue.  Doesn‚Äôt do it all the time, but every now and again it will happen.  It can be hours before it does it again.

Merging car or mostly trucks

Cruising along, right lane slows, truck/car decides to change lane into yours, sometimes very close when it decides, the tesla does not slow until the car/truck is completely in your lane.  You see it beginning to come over, but car is not responding and continues to close until it is completely in the lane.  A few times this happened in a very short space I had to intervene to keep from becoming part of the underside of the truck or a passenger in the car in front of me.  No idea why it is waiting so long to react.  Needs work.  When the cars are further away, it really doesn‚Äôt matter that much because you have so much room.  But when it is tight quarters, it waits too long before responding.   

Road Debris or pot holes

It does not react to road debris or pot holes.  You have to monitor at all times for shredded tires, pot holes or other goodies in your lane of travel and manually steer around.

Lane changing aborts.

I only had one of these during the trip, may had to do with heading into early morning sun hitting the tar lines in between lanes and the tar line was too shiny to determine, lane marking.  I know I had a hard time with it staring into the sun and trying to make out the markings.

Rain

Good amount of rain on the trip down to New Orleans.  No problems, did drop out of NoA into Autopilot and then back into NoA during some heavy parts.  No issues at all.  On way home caught a really nasty down pour deluge, traffic went to emergency blinkers, speed dropped way down, cars pulled off highway.  It was very very difficult to see the lane markings, you pretty much trusted the car or truck in front of you.  NoA dropped into Autopilot, and at times when going really slow you could feel the wheel making constant short corrections, the left barrier seemed close but couldn‚Äôt really tell because rain was coming down so hard and it was very dark, so I would take over.  Sometimes even Autopilot would say, No Go, you take over, I think because speed was so slow, like 5 ‚Äì 10 mph, that may have caused it to drop out of autopilot.  I tried to use it during this time seeing it had sensors and I did not, I only had very limited vision, it had vision and sensors, so I deferred to it.  With the slightest let up in rain autopilot worked like a champ, no more constant adjustments and when it let up even more it returned to NoA.  Even with Rain X on all the windows it was still very difficult to see how close to the barrier you were during the deluge.  It came through, no complaints just not sure what was happening with the short little adjustments on wheel during slow speed.

Bottom line from this trip with 12.1 and 12.1.2 the car did 99% of the driving.  The car is a better driver than I.  The updates continue to improve.   I‚Äôve determined NoA is an opiod, you refuse to drive without it.  I think Elon is now a dealer‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúHey kid, you wanna buy some NoA.    I did get timed out once when I accelerated around some cars to allow the car behind me to pass, I must of gone over the 15mph go sit in the corner rule.  I drove manually for about 10mins, too difficult and boring to constantly monitor your position in your lane, how easily you‚Äôll start to drift to one side or the other.  So I pulled off to shoulder of highway, put it in park, put it back in gear, got back on highway, hit shifter twice and went back to monitoring for road debris.  It‚Äôs a great driving aid, love it.   

Wish

Put a message on screen with button, ‚ÄúI promise I will be good and not go over the 15mph go sit in corner rule‚Äù  This way I don‚Äôt have to pull to shoulder of highway, put it in park and than pull back out on highway.  We all know how dangerous the shoulder of the highway is‚Ä¶  Seeing Elon got us addicted to NoA, he should at least not make us pull off.  Give us one Get out of the Corner Free Pass per trip.

Enjoy your next Tesla adventure.  The car is phenomenal.  Such a pleasure to operate/monitor on a long trip.

TeslaMotors,complaint,ng5bea,My mobile service experience (UK),"For the past year or so I've had a rattle in the the rear reading lights area of my Model 3, and recently got another in the driver's side door bin area. I finally decided to try out Tesla's mobile service to see what they'd be like and if they could figure anything out. Obviously with it being a rattle it's hit or miss if they can fix it and I knew that going into it.

I've now had my Tesla Mobile Service appointment and I have absolutely no complaints! The guy was good fun to have a chat with whilst he was working, the appointment was for a rattling trim piece so he did warn me there's only so much they can do outside of the service center.

Anyway, he looked up how to take apart a bunch of the headliner and we found what we think was the rattle, he's put a foam block in there to hopefully suppress it and put it all back together. He also fixed some other trim pieces whilst he was there that weren't properly connected.

On his way out, he asked for some window cleaner to clean where his head had rubbed against the roof whilst working on the headliner as he didn't want to make me clean even though I said it's fine. Super cool guy who had driven an hour and a half for my appointment from my closest service center. :)

I asked him a couple of questions whilst he was here, mainly these two:

1. What is the most commonly repaired thing on this model year? (2019)
2. What's the build of the new China-built Model 3's like?

To which he answered roughly:

1. The repeaters need to be replaced, it was just a bad batch and isn't a problem anymore.
2. They're amazing, no issues at all, but I kind of need these to be broken otherwise I'm out of a job. (Joking obviously, British humour)

Though I haven't paid yet, the estimate was ¬£85 ($120\~) for 'General diagnosis'. Considering I didn't have to drive an hour and a half to the service center, and, the guy was so friendly and did such in-depth work, I'm more than happy to pay that. No complaints from me at all. (This may come under warranty, will update the post when the app updates the repair estiimate)

Really great work and customer service from the Manchester/Knutsford service team!

Anyway... Just a quick summary of my experience. Not all service experiences are bad clearly!

TeslaMotors,complaint,8y8mfm,"Serious question, why isn‚Äôt Elon / Tesla more concerned about quality control?","Scratches is windshields, sunroof cracks, paint drips, panel misalignments, bubbling up of lining and now [assembley line tools left in cars](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/8y61tu/added_value_found_this_under_the_drivers_side/), this sub shows up a wide range of quality control issues with new contributions almost every day.

Most cases seem to be customers noticing defects seem right at pickup during handover, meaning the final checks of finished vehicles before delivery are either a) operating on a policy that says issues like runs in the paint and scratched glass are acceptable under current quality control standards and will only be brought back into the care centre if the customer makes a complaint or b) Quality control checks are not happening in any meaningful or corrective way at all to begin with. It seems to be the latter.

It may be a case that the issue has already largely been resolved higher up the manufacture process, and that what we are seeing now are vehicles put together during the teething problems a few months ago where model 3 assembley line and ‚Äòfluffer‚Äô issues were the main issues being addressed. Cars assembled and passed out during a period when company focus wasn‚Äôt fixed on the minor details may well be the culprit behind the ‚Äòcrop‚Äô we see now. To be fair, the company is mostly doing the right thing bringing in cars where issues arise to have them resolved and have to handle the complaints in the meantime. If on the other hand however, the issues or the vehicles we see showing up in posts like todays socket wrench under the seat are relatively new, then there is clearly an ongoing culture issue which will continue until it becomes priority and someone with a track record is brought in to oversee quality control. This is cost saving, as in the long run shipping out and then bringing back products to be resolved costs a company much much more than rolling out high quality in the first place both financially and in terms of protecting brand value. We see company statements on a range of issues both related and completely unrelated to the company, but this question of QC which is disturbing to the most invested supporters of the brand never mind causal car purchasers seems to be easily resolved (if quality over producing the highest VIN numbers is a priority) and is at the moment largely unmentioned.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/8y8mfm/serious_question_why_isnt_elon_tesla_more/,xfjqvyks,147116.0,0.8983

TeslaMotors,complaint,410f6w,Reasons why we can expect faster charging on the Model 3,"Straubel has in the past talked about faster charging, such as 10-15min. The goal with the Model [](#e) is to make a mass production car, and the main complaints are cost, charging time and pack life.

The difficulty in faster charging is the cooling required for the pack. The Model [](#s) and X use cheap  high power hot running NCA cells.

Relevant recent-ish news:

- Audi and Ford and Porsche have talked about 150kw fast chargers.

- VW have talked about the ""BUDD-e"" which might use over 320kw charging.

- Tesla have water cooled SC cables.

- Tesla engineers are now working on the pack, which will have new format cells.

- Tesla have upgraded SCs several times and are up to 135kw in several countries.

- The Model X was to have a 15kw charger.

- The Model [](#e) ""instead of pulling in air to cool the batteries through the front of the car, the nose and bottom of the vehicle could act as a fanless heat sink as air is drawn around it. This provides cooling when needed for the batteries and engine/drivetrain"" http://electrek.co/2015/11/17/sources-tesla-model-3-will-have-extreme-aerodynamic-design-details/

How might faster charging be achieved?

1) The new format cells may allow slightly better heat transmission.

2) The new cooling system may be more effective.

3) The new charger standard of 15kw when used in a SC could support 180kw (/u/paulwesterberg 's suggestion) if the 12x 10kw chargers were replaced with 12x 15kw (In the EU etc with 3-ph power, that might be 202kw?).

4) Assisted cooling. As the new SCs already have a water cooling system, it could be extended to offering attachable pack cooling pipes. Another strange idea is to take advantage of the car's use of air cooling by providing directed cool air... somehow.

5) Cooler running cell chemistry such as NMC. The GF will already be producing NMC cells, for the stationary storage market. As with the 7kwh Powerwall which uses NMC, the cells would provide superior longevity which is more important for smaller packs. I think they have a higher cost, but this may be sufficiently addressed by the GF. They probably would have less power, but should overheat less.

I think 2), 3) and 5) are pretty good bets.

With a 180kw SC, a 55kwh car might (if heating is not a problem) be able to get a 80% charge in 15 min.

**Edit:** Musk said in the recent HK vid that he expects **180-200kw** charging, allowing 15-20min charging every 4hrs of driving.

TeslaMotors,complaint,90gzvn,"First model 3 test drive in Dallas, Blue RW","Just did the first test drive of a Model 3 in Dallas @ North Park. Unfortunately, they don't have a P yet, but I was still impressed. 

I'm a 2x Model S owner, currently an 85D and planning to trade in for a P3D. The RW 3 accelerates as fast as, if not faster, than my S. I was pleasantly surprised and can only imagine the P acceleration. 

Overall, the quality was great. Getting used to the single screen will probably take some time, but the upgrades hardware is a night and day difference from my car. The screen is zippy and feels like you'd expect in 2018. 

Handling felt good and the difference between the S and 3 are pretty minor. When you are in sport mode, I'd be surprised if anyone can tell the difference. 

The seats. The seats in my S are the single biggest complaint. They are pretty uncomfortable, the Model 3 seats are really comfortable. 

The turn signal is probably by biggest complaint. The constant signal setting doesn't ""lock"" into place and it is confusing when you've done the 3 signal motion versus the persistent signal. Maybe it is something you get used to, not sure.

TeslaMotors,complaint,fswjlo,Model 3 delivery experience,"[My Model 3](https://imgur.com/a/xhuASCH)

Yesterday I received my Model 3 LR AWD in red through personal delivery at my doorstep. I ordered my car on March 1st, the estimated delivery claimed May, so I was immensly baffled but also happy when I received a mail notification on March 10th that I can get the car on 23rd of March. Albeit in this time frame sanctions by the government were put in place due to the Coronavirus. This postponed my delivery date temporarily to 25th of March. At this time the delivery process would‚Äòve been touchless. Somewhere around mid last week I was called that the whole delivery process would be adapted and that they perform delivery at your doorstep, which normally you would‚Äòve to pay extra. (~ 750‚Ç¨) This would only be carried out if you‚Äòve got access to a private parking spot. The date was now set on 31st 10 AM.

When talking about the delivery process on the telephone with a Tesla representative I wasn‚Äòt sure in what manner the personal delivery would take place. Even they couldn't tell me beforehand, but there were two scenarios: Either my Model 3 will come in a truck or there will be two reps where one of them would drive with my car. The latter scenario was the case and I waited like a little kid on Christmas day and when my car finally arrived I was overwhelmed with joy which made me tear up a bit. I saw two to three Model 3 with red body color in real life prior to mine, but it seemed so surreal to me that this‚Äòd be my car now. Then I got a little enrollment from one of the Tesla representatives and she was very polite and patient and answered all my final questions. We also made sure that we upholded the security measures, namely keeping distance at least over one meter and wearing face masks and gloves from which I offered to her. That meant that when she explained something to me regarding some settings she stood outside of the car. We also set up my phone as a key and the connection and set-up was flawlessy and worked instantly. We also checked the car for potential issues, she showed me the included cable set and the correct technique for closing the frunk respectively. They also gifted me with an emergency kit which apparently isn‚Äòt included. After the delivery took place I made a thorough check. If anyone is looking for a comprehensive checklist you can have a look at https://github.com/mykeln/teslaprep. I saw some videos and forum posts online that mentioned body misalignments or paint color flaws in certain spots. I also noticed that the gap above the trunk is bigger than those of previous models since there were complaints due to rain pouring into the trunk. I  made a very thorough inspection, however I didn‚Äòt find one defect or flaw. This somewhat suprised me, but I was very pleased with the result. This implies that Tesla overhauled their entire QA process and took the feedback very seriously.

The whole delivery process was around 40 minutes and I can not be more grateful to Tesla and especially their respresentatives for taking their time and offering this kind of customer-friendly service. The delivery team also made sure that I received my car as early as possible. I also want to thank Elon Musk and his whole team for creating such a safe, unique, fast, bleeding-edge, cool and environment-friendly car.

TL;DR The whole delivery experience was fast and awesome, I instantly fell in love with my red Model 3 and I can‚Äòt wait to take it on the road.

TeslaMotors,complaint,egu4rj,Non English voice commands and GUI questions,"I live in the US, but have a bilingual household.  Ever since the feature was added earlier this year, I've kept my GUI in Japanese.  It works pretty well, though I have a few minor complaints. (See below)

Anyway, I recently got the update that added support for many more voice commands.  The settings window where you select GUI language has text to it that says (in Japanese) that voice commands only work in English.  However, this seems to not be the case.

It actually seems that the car defaults interpreting my voice as Japanese.  Interesting.  Some commands do with in Japanese.  More interesting. 
 But only a few seem to work.

The release notes (in Japanese) list many other commands that do not work.  I think this is because the release notes are translated from English, and the people doing the translations did not know that they were translating voice commands that had to be in a specific form to work.

For those using languages other than English as your GUI language, could you please post your situation so I can compare notes?


GUI/misc language complaints: 

1. The car is in the US, so when it displays information to someone outside the car, like dog mode or sentry mode, or charge time remaining, the car should be able to display information in English, and not default to my GUI language.  This should be a setting. It is no good to show people in America Japanese text about my dog being safe.

2. As I live in the US, places have English names.  When I use voice commands for navigation, should I say these names in English?  In Japanese?  It is unclear.  What if I were driving in Japan and had to say the place names in English?  That would be weird.

3. I can send texts using voice commands, but only in Japanese -- everything gets converted to Japanese, even when I speak English.  That's fine when I am sending something to my wife, but to anyone else, I'd like it to be English.  Perhaps there is a way I can voice-select language when giving the command?  

4. Some translations are not that great -- here's an example.  In the Tesla app, there is ""electronic key"".  Below it has a status.  In English, the status is ""connected"", ""connecting"", or ""not connected"".  In Japanese, this is translated as ""cable connected"", ""cable connecting"", and ""cable not connected"".  The person translating this string didn't know what it would be applied to.  There are similar situations in the in-car GUI.

TeslaMotors,complaint,d1cgaf,Don't be afraid to change configuration if you're not assigned a VIN. Get the car you want.,"Personal anecdote here and surely there are others with different experiences. Apologies for the wall of text.

TL;DR: Get the car you want. Your delivery specialist likely knows only as much as you do, plus conjecture at the SC, and your change could put your delivery date earlier even if your delivery specialist says otherwise.

I put in my deposit on day one for the Model 3. Held off on getting it for various reasons, until someone from Tesla called me wondering why I hadn't purchased. They suggested I take back my deposit and just order normally when I'm ready. Cool. No regrets doing that.

Finally decided it was time to order as my current car was having problems and the costs of owning a 200k mi Nissan with emerging transmission problems outweighed any reason I could manufacture for not spending on the car I have wanted for years now.

I had ordered a white ext, black int P3D+ on 7/23 and like everyone who has ordered a white paint recently, has been waiting for more than a month when the order status page says two weeks. No real complaints about that, other than the slow trickle of updates to eventually let me know of the delay. It would have been nice simply to set my mental expectations for some kind of timeline. Honestly I'll take that any day over being pressured by a dealership.

While waiting, I've slowly been convincing myself that I had made a mistake with the black interior. My current car has a black interior and I have loved it but hated it at the same time, and I've been working up there courage to make the change to white.

I sent the change request on Friday and I get an email from my advisor yesterday (Saturday) that my car is expected to arrive *later this month* and this change will disrupt that plan. I seriously considered second guessing myself and leaving it. I'm no stranger to waiting for what I want though, so I told her to go ahead with it fully expecting another month or more of waiting.

I wake up this morning, grab some coffee, and receive a text that I've been assigned a VIN and to schedule my delivery of a white/white P3D+ with FSD. Next week I'll be getting the car I want when all signs pointed to having to wait even longer for changing my mind off the design. The delivery specialist explicitly told me the change will make me wait even longer.

I'm excited and wanted to assure anyone else who is on the fence waiting that changing your design is not as big of a deal as it's let on. I could of course just be lucky and YMMV. It makes me wonder if the warnings from my specialist were based on facts, experiences, or just the reluctance to be required to do work on my account to make my requested change.

Get the car you want. If I didn't change, I'd probably still be waiting that month the specialist quoted more waiting for white/black.

TeslaMotors,complaint,axr2nf,Delivery going wrong,"Delivery was scheduled for today and I was prepared to pick up the car. Delivery manager called this morning and said something was wrong with the touchscreen and they needed to reinstall software, and rescheduled to later the same day. Arrive with a check, and they tell me that the problem hasn‚Äôt been resolved and maybe they can deliver tonight.  Maybe later in the week. 

I‚Äôve already drawn the money for the loan, and added it to my insurance. But no car. And now I‚Äôm not sure I want to buy a busted one! 

Anyone know about how to escalate these complaints? If they needed time to get the car ready they could have scheduled a delivery further into the future. Now I‚Äôm holding the debt with no certainty when I‚Äôll get a car. And can‚Äôt bail as I‚Äôd lose my $2500 down.

I understand people have negative experiences with Tesla Service Centers. But with minor fixes, I have to say they've been very positive for me. I had all my sensors replaced a few months ago, then recently had one of the front sensors reinstalled (from debris while my spouse was driving). Both service visits only took about 8 hours. And both visits free. Without even asking, they also replaced the fog light, which was cracked from debris too. All free of cost. 

My only complaint is their phone line is worthless and they've overestimated their finish time by about half a day.

TeslaMotors,complaint,8isyb0,HWPC vs portable charger on NEMA 14-50,"tldr: The portable charger that comes with the TM3 maxes out at 32 amps.  If you want more than that you will need to install the Tesla high power wall charger (HPWC). For TM3, HPWC caps out at 48 amps. 

Longer version:
I got my TM3 on May 3rd and today had an electrician install a NEMA 14-50 outlet in my garage tied to a 60 amp breaker. I plugged my car and expected to see it pulling 48 amps, but saw it was only pulling 32 amps. The first thing I thought was the electrician cheated me on the wire, but I did some digging and confirmed the version of the portable charger that comes with all Teslas does not push more than 32 amps. 

I read SO much about the TM3 over the past several months and not once found that nugget of info. Even the guy at the Tesla dealership who introduced me to my car said TM3 owners get no benefit from the HEPC over a NEMA 14-50 because the max either one can push to my car is 48 amps.  I feel like this needs to be a PSA.

TeslaMotors,complaint,5o6vv4,Pedestrian avoidance activated,"Of course this was with a friend who had never been in a Tesla before. 

We were driving along a straight 2-lane road with autopilot set to 45 mph (speed limit). The road was flanked with sidewalks on both sides. In the distance, about 75m away, were two older folks walking on my side of the road away from the car at slow speed on the sidewalk. As we were about 10m away, the vehicle braked hard while flashing the pedestrian crossing warning and beeping loudly. It seemed to realize that there was nothing in the way after the initial hard brake, so it didn't completely stop before I took over. 

Both people were not on the road, nor were they in the process of walking into the road, so I'm not really sure why it assessed that an emergency stop was necessary. We weren't particularly close to the sidewalk either, maybe 5-7ft away. I've never experienced anything like this before. 

Given the mysterious nature of the pedestrian avoidance feature, I figured this was worth sharing to see if this was a common occurrence?

TeslaMotors,complaint,8pjk8v,Model 3 Review: First Car Ever,"I reserved online on day 0 and finally had my LR Model 3 delivered yesterday! This is my first car ever and I spent the past few years using Uber, Zipcar and Maven whenever necessary. Here are my thoughts:

Delivery:
I went in with the delivery checklist and threw it in the backseat and never looked at it again. They had my car out and waiting and all my paperwork was prepared in 10-15 mins. I found some goop on the roof which came off easily and a negligible scratch in the tail light about 2cm across which I didn‚Äôt care about but my delivery specialist noted it and put in a work order. My specialist spent a good amount of time helping me setup my phone key and driving settings and seemed to know everything about the car.

Service:
That‚Äôs right, I went to the service station on the first day. I got home and parked the car to pick someone up and when I came back to it, there was a small pool of liquid under it. Being paranoid, I rushed it to the service center where I met another nice and knowlegeable man who assured me it was just AC condensation and told me unprompted about how I should order online for the wheel caps if I take off the Aeros because it‚Äôs more expensive at the station. 

Interior:
I‚Äôve driven my parent‚Äôs 340i and X1 before and the only thing I can complain about is the steering wheel. The seats, screen, visor materials seem on par with entry level luxury cars but the steering wheel feels just a little bit cheap. All the tech worked really well and maybe because I grew up in the age of black mirrors, I prefer having a big uninterrupted view of the road in front of me while the car info is on the screen on the side. The glass roof is an underrated feature and it‚Äôs hard to capture through media how roomy and fresh the inside feels because of it. I was told the back seats were also comfortable and the rear AC was adequate. 

Drive:
This is a car. It‚Äôs not a smartphone that happens to also be a car; this is a no compromises car. It‚Äôs quick, the steering is responsive and the acceleration is empowering. Given my 2-3 years of purely rental driving, I drove pretty low end compacts with the exception of the 340 and X1. I have never felt more confident at the wheel than I have with this car despite my absolute dread at going through traffic in the biggest purchase of my life. The regenerative braking takes about 20-30 miles to get used to and I prefer the steering on sport. 
I used autopilot and it was a lot smoother than I expected. I like driving it so much that I don‚Äôt know how often I‚Äôll use it for the next few months. 

Impact:
I stopped for lunch and some kids slowly approached the car to take pictures almost immediately. People are very excited about it and it‚Äôs nice to see the level of interest from people who aren‚Äôt fanboys like me. Sometimes there‚Äôs too much interest though, I parked in my friends apartment deck illegally for 2 hours and the booting guys clearly came to check out the car and then noticed it didn‚Äôt have an apartment sticker. While waiting for them to unboot it, we counted 18 other cars without stickers in our row. 

Summary:
It was definitely worth the wait and it has changed my view of Tesla from being a tech company that makes cars to a car company with great tech. No complaints worth mentioning and I hope Tesla can keep the quality up in both the products and the people involved such as the amazingly helpful service tech. 


PS. Pretty sure they‚Äôre lying about the 0-60 time, I‚Äôm going to try to time it but I think it‚Äôs close to 4.6-4.8",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/8pjk8v/model_3_review_first_car_ever/,thedarkveda,1057.0,0.9976
TeslaMotors,complaint,itnf7j,MCU Problems After Replacement,"TLDR: Got my 1st gen MCU replaced under warranty three months ago. The current unit functions but is noticeably slow even for basic tasks and often freezes. On average I have to reset it once a week. Any suggestions?

I‚Äôve got a 2014 Model S P85D and it‚Äôs generally been great to me. Bought it used from Tesla in 2018 and had minimal problems. I now have just a few thousand miles before my warranty expires and I‚Äôm worried if I don‚Äôt speak up now I‚Äôm basically screwed with having to buy another MCU out of pocket soon. 

I inquired about upgrading to a 2nd gen MCU when my first one failed and was told I was not yet eligible for an upgrade. My 1st gen MCU was replaced under warranty, I‚Äôm assuming with a refurbished unit.

It‚Äôs been about three months since the swap and  overall the screen is slow to switch between ‚Äúapplications‚Äù or even just bring up the control panel. Sometimes the rear camera doesn‚Äôt come up the first time when I put the car into reverse. The screen freezes from time to time and on average I‚Äôd say I have to perform a reset once a week. 

I‚Äôve tried the few tricks I know like a full reset while in park and also clearing out all addresses in the map view. 

Here‚Äôs my biggest question: am I off base to expect a better experience? My previous MCU performed better than this prior to dying. And if I do put in a service request, what exactly is my complaint? That it‚Äôs slow and sometimes freezes? I feel like the guy who calls Best Buy because his computer is running slow... not the easiest problem to quantify or replicate.

TeslaMotors,complaint,btibrp,Is Tesla (Elon) Listening to Us Customers? (Discussion),"I love my model 3 but sometimes I have to wonder if anyone at Tesla is listening to our complaints.  Phantom braking is a big one,  Go to any forum and you can find long threads on this issue that go back at least a year or longer.  If I were managing this software development I would be on my programmers to find a solution and get it fixed.  

Initially, the backup camera worked well on the S and after a few iterations to improve quality, on the 3 but now it fails to start on putting the car into reverse and can require a reboot or long wait.  They broke something that was working and still haven't fixed it.  There are many threads complaining about this but it still isn't fixed.

Handling road splits and on ramp merges that sometimes create a new lane.  These are basic functions that the developers just can't seem to get to work properly.

Get rid of the steering wheel nag.  First, it isn't a reliable indicator that a person is paying attention nor is it a reliable indicator that a person has a hand or two on the wheel.  An unreliable system for safety is worse than no system. Use the inside camera to monitor for attention, add a capacitance sensor to the steering wheel or do away with it altogether.

Lane changing.  Customers have been complaining about lane changing behavior since it came out.  I appears to be programmed to always slow down for a lane change so when merging onto a freeway, instead of speeding up to fit into an opening it slows down and then very very slowly tries to move into the other lane, often hesitating and changing its mind half way through.  Human drivers, that know how to drive naturally speed up to match the flow of traffic and then on finding an opening speed up just enough to slip in.  Numerous threads on this topic and no real significant improvement in these areas.

I think Tesla and Elon should want to eliminate these complaints once and for all.  Then move on to the next big feature or improvement.  I will gladly give up my whoopee cushion to do away with phantom braking that scares the crap out of my passengers (I guess that is another type of whoopee cushion but one not well appreciated).

Please get these things fixed so we can enjoy using them and move on to bigger and better things.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/btibrp/is_tesla_elon_listening_to_us_customers_discussion/,barjohn5670,2582.0,-0.3092
TeslaMotors,complaint,7j32a5,REALLY hoping to hear from my CPO Specialist/Delivery Specialist....,"I placed an order for a CPO S 85, 5 weeks ago tomorrow. I was told 3-5 weeks. Last week, I was told the vehicle was done, and they would be transporting it from Milford, CT Service Center to Dedham, MA for me to pick up.

That was last Monday. I haven't heard an update since. It's a 2 1/2 hour drive between locations. Waiting for a week+ for a product that already exists and doesn't need to be built from scratch isn't giving me ""warm and fuzzies"".

Can someone explain to me, in a way that can calm me down, why it would take 8 days (or more) to traverse 144 miles?

My trade-in offer expires Thursday. It would be annoying if I had to do MORE paperwork.



EDIT: In fairness to Tesla, I didn't want to leave my ""complaint thread"" hanging out there.

Vehicle found. Paperwork in order. Appointment scheduled for Wednesday. I wish I didn't have to track all of this down myself. (I was literally on the phone with the local Service Center to see if they had it, when my CPO Specialist called me on the other line.)

Here's to hoping physical delivery and any service experiences are more pleasant and communicative than wondering where my car was.

TeslaMotors,complaint,dcgtpk,Model 3 Charging Thud and Service Bulletin,"I was charging a Model 3 last winter on a 240v and heard a loud thud.  I have since then heard it many times in cold weather.   This has been posted many time in this sub \[1,2,3\], and each time the top comment is something along the lines of this being normal.

However, Tesla has a service bulletin that states, ""The 'thunk' noise occurs when the air pressure outside the battery is different than the air pressure inside battery"" and ""Upon customer complaint of a 'thunk' noise coming from the HV battery, replace the HV battery breathers with updated components that will help equalize the pressure inside the battery with the pressure outside, faster and quieter."" \[4\]

Now, I have no experience with service bulletins, but I don't understand how is this normal, as everyone says, including my service center, yet Tesla is saying there is a fix to mitigate it?  Has anyone used this service bulletin to get their service center to install the new HV battery breathers?

Someone posted this service bulletin a while back, but I couldn't find it in my searching.  All I found was people saying this was normal, which seems at odds with Tesla's service bulletin.  Common, sure.  Normal, why?

tl;dr: Thud sound from charging in the cold has a fix Tesla knows about.  Shouldn't this fix be deployed, and not just tell people that sound is ""normal""?

TeslaMotors,complaint,k6c5p5,Unable to change model Y at home and charged 190$ by mobile service for inspections that were not done,"Hey everyone, so my father recently got his model Y and didn‚Äôt realize until about a week later due to travel that he cannot charge at home using his mobile charger using either the standard wall plug or nema 14-50. 

He scheduled a mobile service appointment since no service center has availability and the technician arrived and didn‚Äôt even look at the car. 

He then informed my father that his charger is likely bad and he cannot do anything about it due to them being back ordered and stating one would be ordered then the appointment ended.

TeslaMotors,complaint,6ob9we,Autopiloting cross country: a 2015-2017 comparison,"TL/DR, autopiloting cross country was great in 2015 and is still great.

I first [traveled cross country in my Model S in 2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/3q33rl/i_am_autopiloting_my_way_across_the_us_i_sleep_in/), shortly after AP1 was introduced. Two years later, I just got back from my second supercharged cross country trip and thought that I‚Äôd share a comparison with last time. Both trips were made in the same late 2014 P85D (AP1).

1. **Autopilot Comparison**
    1. Wow, Autopilot nagging is a real thing! I don‚Äôt notice in my daily drives since I typically rest my hand on the steering wheel, which prevents the nag, and my daily drives are ~20 minutes. But in 2015, I used to be able to sit back for an hour‚Äôs stretch on long, flat areas in the midwest, plains, and southwestern deserts. Definitely not possible anymore now that it‚Äôs on a timer.
    2. The tendency to unintentionally take offramps seems to have actually gotten a little worse. 
    3. I finally experienced the phantom braking that people have been complaining about. It was never very aggressive and was never unsafe, but was an occasional annoyance. I‚Äôd say it happened 10-12 times over the 7,000 mile trip.
    4. Truck lust has been (mostly) fixed. Used to be a very dangerous bug, now just mildly dangerous :)
    5. Despite these minor complaints, AP definitely seems smoother and more reliable in general. I loved AP1 when it came out, and still think it‚Äôs the best thing. Sorry, AP2 guys, you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre missing :)
2. **Supercharging Comparison**
    1. So many new superchargers! Love being able to explore new states such as Iowa and Nebraska which were previously unavailable via supercharging.
    2. So many crowds! In 2015, I was usually the only one at any SC. Was surprised at how rare that was the case, especially in PA and the midwest. 
    3. In 2015, many SC visits came with owner chats or random strangers asking about the car. This happened far less frequently this time.
    4. Many SCs have expanded! For example, Barstow CA had maybe 8 in 2015? It now has 16! 
    5. I still have never had to wait at a SC, even in popular CA SCs like Barstow, Harris Ranch, and Gilroy. In fact, every CA site I stopped in was HUGE with 16+ SCs.
    6. The [Superchargers iPhone app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/superchargers-for-tesla/id1056496235?mt=8) is super useful! Really nice being able to see POIs and comments/checkins left by other drivers. 
    7. Most new SCs have a pull through spot which people often comment is for those towing a trailer; however, they are still useless for towing because a trailer would jut out into traffic.
    8. I was in the middle of the Southwestern heat wave (many days over 105 deg!), and Supercharging tended to slow down a lot in the heat. Would often start at 115kW and immediately drop down to 40-50kW even with low SoC. 
    9. Elon‚Äôs [tweet about being able to reach every point in the contiguous US](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/884914920130723840) is complete bullshit. WTF Elon? **EDIT**: maybe not, see below
3. **Navigation Comparison**
    1. Tesla nav still sucks. Compared to Waze, it plots longer routes and doesn‚Äôt recognize traffic very well. It also wanted me to take several illegal turns while navigating to and from SCs. 
    2. Having said that, the time estimates have improved a great deal, and were usually very close, with a few weird exceptions where it said it would take 90 minutes to go 25 miles.
    3. The feature that shows how occupied a SC is is wholly unreliable. I get that it‚Äôs supposed to be delayed, but there were times when it would say a site had 2/8 stalls open, I‚Äôd get there and be the only one there for the entire session, and it said only 2/8 stalls open the whole time.
4. **Miscellaneous**
    1. I didn‚Äôt go online very often, so it was weird getting my Tesla news from sources other than /r/teslamotors.
    2. My Blackvue dr650 dashcam ceased all motor functions; I think it may have fried in the southwestern heat wave. I saw a funky brown Model 3 with something weird attached on the roof while supercharging at Dublin CA, but have no evidence, alas.
    3. [Did I break a record](http://imgur.com/OFLvZo6)?  Sorry for potato, I think the heat addled my phone as well as my brain. 130 degrees F in Death Valley!
    4. I will probably flood /r/superchargers with pics over the next few days.

In fact the Next Gen seats would be amazingly comfortable except for one really aggravating problem I'm having.

Sorry for the bad picture, it was taken in my garage. See the circled area? That's where a rather prominent seam or stitched area is present on the seat. Now I don't know if it's my exact height, torso shape, curvature of my spine, or the simple fact that I'm a tall and lanky individual in real life who doesn't have a lot of padding in that area, but after awhile driving the car, I can feel this seam or stitched area digging into my back and it hurts. It's really uncomfortable. I don't know what to do about this.

For anyone who's curious, I didn't notice this problem on my test drive because it was overcast and cold that day and I was wearing a jacket. But it's a very noticeable issue for me when I'm wearing a T-shirt or my work shirts.

Has anyone else noticed this problem, and what have you done to solve it? I love the car and it's otherwise quite comfortable to sit in but this seam or whatever is driving me insane.

California Vehicle Code 11796 states:

It is unlawful for any dealer licensed under this article to do any of the following when brokering a retail sale:

(c)‚ÄÇFail to refund any purchase money, including purchase deposits, upon demand by a consumer at any time prior to the consumer's signing of a vehicle purchase agreement with a selling dealer AND taking delivery of the vehicle described in the brokering agreement.

I would however have access to a charger at my parents house which is only a few minutes away. I don't drive a lot because I work from home 95% of the time so I don't know how often I would need to charge. 

Would you still buy a Tesla in my situation?

TeslaMotors,would buy if,gzzj5h,I returned my Model Y back to Tesla - Full Story/Details,"I have been hesitant to post my experience on this subreddit, but ultimately decided this information should be shared with the community. I have added some more details from another post to help outline the facts.

As the title states I returned my Model Y PUP back to Tesla Monday. This was mainly due to safety concerns and poor customer service. I will try and keep my recap short, but there are several items to cover...

I took delivery Friday June 5th in Kansas City (Delivery Center that was assigned). On my way home to Oklahoma City, about half way, I heard some noise from under the car. I pulled over to find the front aero piece hanging down and not attached. I see that I am a mile from a Casino parking lot (in the middle of nowhere Kansas) and decide to limp it there to evaluate further. That mile I could hear terrible noises coming from the front, but I didn't want to be on the shoulder of the interstate dealing with this, so I slowly made it to that parking lot. I call Tesla Roadside and am given the option to drive it back to Kansas City for service or have it towed. They tell me that the towing option would be covered only if the issue is deemed to be a warranty item. If they find its a warranty item I can work on being reimbursed. At this point I had the car for 48 hours and driven 250 miles. I had not hit anything or gone over any rough terrain. I felt confident that this would be a warranty issue. So, in order to avoid any further damage to the vehicle, I opted for the tow and thought I would get this worked out at the service center.¬†

I had it towed to the Kansas City service center Sunday night. An interesting point to note is that there was miscommunication with the tow truck company, and the tow truck driver was told that Tesla paid for the tow in full, so I wouldn't have to sign anything or pay. I asked the driver a few times to confirm, and figured maybe if they find that it wasn't a warranty issue they add it to my service invoice (my first Tesla and Service Experience).

The next day (Monday) after finding accommodations in Kansas City for the night, I arrived at the service center in the morning to make sure everything was handled. Explained what happened, they apologize profusely and say they will take a look. After letting them work on it for a few hours, I hear nothing, but since I don‚Äôt live in Kansas City and have nothing to do, I decide to wait at the Tesla center. My advisor comes out and says the car is ready to drive, but since they don‚Äôt have parts they have just secured it to be ‚Äúdriveable.‚Äù No estimates on when they can get parts (I expected that) and we would address it as soon as they are available. He then tells me this absolutely is covered under warranty because the bolts were not secured properly and it wasn‚Äôt done right at the factory. So, I am glad to hear this, but seriously concerned by the oversight. My advisor then tells me I am responsible for the $1,100 tow truck bill. I am initially confused because the car could not be driven without causing more damage. I wasn‚Äôt close to any store where I could buy supplies to tape it up, and I don‚Äôt want to be blamed for more damage. They tell me I can contact Tesla corporate myself and plead my case, but not to expect much. Disappointed about this outcome, I decide to leave the store to try and get some answers from corporate. I spend the next hour trying to get through to a real person which shockingly is more difficult than I thought it would be. I was only able to get a hold of someone by using roadside assistance. I tell the situation to the agent and the agent confirms that ‚Äúif the repair was covered under warranty then the tow should be included in that claim‚Äù. So basically this issue is with the service center and not corporate according to them.

So my 3rd trip to the service center starts with them completely agreeing that this is a warranty repair. I then tell him that Tesla customer service on the phone said that if it‚Äôs a warranty repair then the towing should be covered. He agrees, but says management won‚Äôt budge. I say I will need this to be resolved because this is my 3rd trip here and the tow truck driver is calling my phone for payment. After a long back room discussion they tell me Tesla WILL pay for it, they just don‚Äôt know if the Service Department or Roadside Assistance group will be paying it. I also find out the long delays are because all of this is being done by email... They don't have a number to call someone about it. That seems like an impossible way to get anything done in a timely manner, but that what I was told...

At this point I am upset that this has been so difficult and wasted my entire day, and being an out of town customer looks like it will be a nightmare. I was only able to get this far because I stayed in Kansas City an extra night and took off work. I tell them I am returning the car and want to start that process. I think they were shocked and I was told this was the first time any customer had done this (at their location). I loved the car, I love Tesla and still do. I just can‚Äôt deal with this type of stuff in the future. I can update everyone on the return process as it continues. All they had me do Monday was sign a ‚ÄúReturn Declaration‚Äù and hand them the keys.

Haven't heard a word from anyone else at Tesla since yesterday at the store. I just hoping to get some confirmation that my refund is in process.

TL;DR - I bought a Tesla Model Y 2 days ago. A manufacturing defect caused me to be stuck 2 1/2 hours from home. Tesla covered the repair under warranty but refused to pay the $1,100 tow truck bill. With some of the delivery issues, this warranty repair, and the terrible customer service it made me rethink this purchase and I walked away. Still like Tesla, but will wait until things are more ironed out.

Some Clarifications

\- the ""aero piece"" is different than the Model 3, it is a hard plastic cover. Some have commented that its just a fabric. On my car it would drag and flap wildly hitting underneath anytime I went over 30 MPH.

\- My biggest concern was voiding the warranty. I could Uber 20 miles to get some tape or remove it. However, I was unable to get any confirmation from Tesla that if I proceed with taping/removing it that it wouldn't void my warranty.- I didn't really return it due to the failure, it was more from how difficult it was to get a hold of anyone at Tesla and discuss the issue. Living in a state that does not have any Tesla locations made me realize that if I had a problem it might be a difficult thing to resolve.

\- My comment about loving Tesla comes from all the things they are trying to accomplish. The car had very little issues (no more than any other new car I had purchased). I know there are some that are in terrible shape and there is no excuse for that. The car was great, and amazing to drive. They really just lost me on the on going support.¬†

&#x200B;

Edit: Some have asked for proof -  [https://imgur.com/a/LvHqk82](https://imgur.com/a/LvHqk82) \- This is the return document signed. It is not an early build for anyone tracking the VINs. The door listed a production date of May 2020, post factory shutdown.

Edit 2: A picture of the damage and panel -  [https://imgur.com/a/gLoZkms](https://imgur.com/a/gLoZkms)  \- The wind would catch this panel and it would hit the car and drag on the ground. My understanding is that the Model Y has a slightly different part than the older Model 3's that were using a fabric composite. I was not close to a store to complete my own repair, and no way to get a hold of Tesla and confirm my own temporary repair wouldn't void the warranty. Regardless, I was disappointed this part wasn't secured properly at delivery. I did not hit anything, you can see the front lip and the rest of the underside has not scrapes or damage.

Update 1: Just had a call with a Tesla employee at the Kansas City location. He confirmed that my return is in process and I should expect funds back in 15-20 days. He was very nice and professional, but couldn't offer any more information on if my situation will be reviewed by Customer Service leaders at the company.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,y3bg89,"As a non-Tesla EV owner, I now get it!","I get it.  I now understand why so many people are emphatically over the moon with their Tesla. I myself drive an Audi e-tron and my wife drives a Volvo XC60 PHEV, but over the past week we drove a Model Y Long Range over 850 miles while on vacation. We drove it in downtown urban areas, suburbs, on the interstate, on back country roads, a National Park, and even an international border. After driving the car for a week in many different types of driving scenarios, I can confidently say driving a Tesla is the most complete EV experience currently on the market. The key word here is EV, as the majority of my dislikes stem around the car part of the Y we rented. The EV/Software part of the Y was nearly a full chef's kiss. The only thing that really left a bad taste in my mouth was a few aspects of the auto-pilot (AP) system.

Things I loved:

* Plug and charge
* In car route planning with charging
* Showing how many spots were open at a Super Charger
* One pedal driving
* Amazing efficiency
* AP can find and maintain a lane like no other system I've used

Things that were neat:

* The slight delay before regen kicked in when coming off AP, giving you enough time to get your foot on the accelerator.
* The speed limit recognition system automatically converting KPH to MPH when driving into Canada.
* The charge door opening when pressing the button on the charger handle
* Being able to watch a Hulu show while waiting to board a car ferry.

Things I didn't really care for but wasn't a big deal

* The two step door handles were a little annoying
* The driving info on the left side of the screen was a little gimmicky. I would have preferred to have a full screen map then an animation of a semi-truck that was actually a car pulling a trailer.
* The vegan leather looked and felt cheap but the seats were ultimately comfortable to sit in for hours which is really what is important.
* No real-time visualization of traffic along the route. I'm fairly certain traffic was taken into account when route planning, but there is no indication I could find to show it on the map. Ultimately not a big deal since it really did seem like traffic was taken into account when creating a route.

Things I really didn't like

* The suspension is subpar. The Y really needs better suspension and maybe even an air suspension system. Once the roads start to get a little rough, the suspension really started to show its faults. It was fine on smooth roads though.
* Road noise is a problem. It gets loud in the cabin over 60 mph, especially if the road is not perfectly smooth.
* There were various squeaks and creaks when going over bumps and on rough roads.
* Looking at the map while driving was a bit of a neck stretch. Like I said before, it would have been nice to have a full screen map or at least have it positioned closer to the driver.
* There is no cruise control speed memory past being able to automatically set it at the speed limit (or X% past the speed limit)
* The torque sensor for AP is not very sensitive. Our Audi is capacitive but the Volvo uses a torque sensor and only takes the slightly nudge to recognize an input. I could wiggle the Y's steering wheel and nothing. I ended up just flicking the volume up and down in these cases which was a little annoying.

Things that drove me bonkers

* Adaptive cruise control is way too sensitive. I only had one phantom braking instance but there were many times I would pass a parked car, a cyclist, a runner, a car turning left in front of me, and a few other things that would trigger a panic brake scenario. Our Audi and Volvo do not have this problem.
* No blind spot monitoring system. I found Tesla's solution to blind spots more effort and increased the amount of time when my eyes were off the road. Almost every other manufacturer has a light on the mirror which lets you quickly look in your mirror and see if someone is in your blind spot simultaneously. It's a two step process in a Tesla and I found myself manually checking my blind spots in heavy traffic situations.
* AP disabling every single time I changed lanes. In moderate traffic, this became a nuisance every time I moved into the left lane to pass someone.
* Auto high beams when AP was enabled. I ended up blinding a bunch of people because this system is not up to snuff. Our Audi and Volvo do not have this problem. I eventually just turned AP off after getting flashed multiple times by oncoming cars.
* AP is an all or nothing system. It's great at maintaining your lane, but in the rare instance it didn't,  I wish the system would let you make a small correction instead of disabling altogether. It was very jerky and would fight me in those situations. It just didn't feel safe.

I do want to touch on AP one more time as I was blown away by how well it would maintain a lane. It didn't matter if it was a construction zone with a temporary lane made of cones or a twisty mountain road full of switch backs. The darn car would stay in the center of the lane and handle almost any turn no matter how tight. It truly is next level in this aspect. The big problem I had with AP was the ancillary systems around it that made the experience like monitoring a toddler. Frankly, AP is much more advanced than Audi or Volvo's system but the latter systems are so much more relaxing to use, especially on the interstate where lane markings are generally good.

Alright. If you have read this far you're probably thinking I hate the vehicle after how much complaining I did but that truly isn't the case. The things that made the Y great were weighted much higher than what wasn't so great. Point being, the EV/Software aspects of the car are so polished that I get how people are willing to overlook some of the things Tesla doesn't do well with. Would I buy one? IDK. Maybe. It's hard to say since we already have two nice cars, but at the very least I get what the hype is about. I'm also having a hard time adjusting to not having one pedal driving on my e-tron after spending a week with the Tesla so there is that. :)

>Republican Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska proposed prohibiting people making more than $100,000 a year from claiming EV tax credits and to end tax credits for EVs that cost more than $40,000 -- levels that would exclude many of the electric vehicles on the market or planned to come to the market in the next few years, including those promoted by President Joe Biden recently at the White House.

This amendment passed 51-48, so it looks like there's no incentive on the horizon for all you folks who were holding out.

>Perhaps more significantly, Sen. Fischer's amendment also restricts the tax credit to EVs that cost less than $40,000. Consequently, the only battery EVs that will still be eligible for the tax credit will be the **Hyundai Ioniq Electric** ($34,250), **Hyundai Kona EV** ($38,565), **Mini Cooper SE** ($30,750), and the **Nissan Leaf S Plus** ($39,220). Chevrolet's Bolt EV and Bolt EUV are both below the price threshold, but in 2019 the automaker sold its 200,000th plug-in vehicle, at which point the tax credit began to phase out.

It's unfortunate that there's *any* restrictions being imposed on the electrification of the US auto market, but if this is the cost of getting those who are least likely to be able to afford an EV (lower income folks) to consider purchasing, this is better than nothing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/p2fufe/us_senate_passes_amendment_that_removes/,coreyonfire,85029.0,0.6401
TeslaMotors,would buy if,h8uq22,Refused delivery of my Model Y,"Yesterday was the day that I was finally going to take delivery of a Model Y (LR/AWD/Induction/Blue/Black). I live in Seattle, WA and we (my wife and two kids) drove down to the Renton Service Center for delivery.

I was armed with delivery checklist and was mentally prepared to walk away from the car if it seemed like it had too many issues. Well, I won't bury the lede: it had way too many issues. The highlights:

-	Almost a dozen small paint issues/scratches all over the car (front and back).
-	A few large scratches on the rear bumper area.
-	Several panel gaps that were either too wide or too narrow (flush with another panel or trim).
-	Condensation in one of the fog lights.
-	Door trim that was oddly faded and not matching the blackness of the rest of the trim.
-	Rear tail lights totally mis-mounted and sticking out / mis-aligned.

It‚Äôs pretty clear that little to no quality control or inspection went into this vehicle (vin # 011xxx) before it was presented to me for delivery.

The delivery specialist I spoke to was pretty clear: if I accepted delivery, it would be my car and I‚Äôd have to hope for the best in terms of getting these issues fixed. He also reminded me that if I returned the car under their 7-day return policy, I would be prohibited by buying another Model Y for 1 year.

He suggested that I give them a chance to correct the issues. He seemed confident that his delivery team could correct the paint/cosmetic issues, but he said he‚Äôd have to check with Service on the issues regarding panel gaps, tail light mounting, etc.

So, we drove home without the Tesla Model Y. I apologized to my wife and promised my kids a treat on the way home. I‚Äôm expecting to hear from Tesla about a re-scheduled delivery, so fingers crossed that they can correct these issues!

On question and one bit of strong advice:

Advice: whether you take delivery OR NOT, please take tons of pictures and video. I didn‚Äôt do that, and I really wish I had so that I could share them with you all now and get your thoughts on whether these were issues or not.

Question: Does anyone know of any good, clear photos of what ‚Äúspec‚Äù panel gaps and alignment should be? I would have killed to have been able to reference this during my delivery.

Thanks!

For all the comments about the Tesla Return Policy:

Relevant section:

‚ÄúIf you decide to order another vehicle, you may not order the same trim for a period of 12 months but may order another vehicle in a different trim at any time.‚Äù 

**UPDATE #3:**

Just wanted to let you all know that I emailed the Tesla advisor that initially had emailed me about my Model Y back in April. I‚Äôm not really sure if this person is ‚Äúassigned‚Äù to me, and other people had called me about preparing for yesterday‚Äôs delivery. I don‚Äôt know if Tesla has ‚Äúdelivery specialists‚Äù anymore or what their process is, but this was the only person I could think to email.

Anyway, I asked for a new VIN. After sleeping on it and looking at pictures/videos of other Model Y‚Äôs, I just didn‚Äôt feel good about this car. Even if they could correct all these issues I could see, what about the issues I can‚Äôt see?

I had to cancel the auto insurance I had preemptively purchased (whoops) and I‚Äôm wondering if Tesla is going to start billing me for loan payments on a car that I haven‚Äôt received yet. They already have my loan deposit and signed loaned paperwork.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,mpymod,"So, I drove a Tesla for the first time","I'm going to be downvoted to oblivion, but I thought I'd share my experience here anyway, because why not.

For some background: my current (ICE) car is approaching the ripe age of 11 years (we bought it new, and it's still going strong). I'd like my next car to be an EV, and of course Tesla is the first brand I thought about. An ER Model 3 costs 5x times what I paid for my current car. I would never even consider paying that for a ""regular"" car, but Teslas are... Teslas. I've watched all the videos, read all the reviews. Sure, QA is not great, but the tech looks so sweet, and the future is shining. Last weekend I had a trip down to Canberra (3 hours away), and decided to rent a Model 3 through Evee (Airbnb for EVs in Australia, basically). The owner was a top bloke and took a whole hour to give be a pretty comprehensive crash course (no pun intended, more on that later).

Alright, that's how I got my hands on a Tesla for the first time.

The good:

* the ""dumb"" auto-pilot (lane keeping and smart cruise control) are absolutely amazing on the highway. It was the most relaxed I ever felt driving
* the trip planning (in terms of charging stops) works really well and helped a lot with range anxiety. The supercharging is convenient and fairly quick. I had some trouble getting the cable out of the thing, but someone helped me out
* which takes me to the community: Tesla drivers seem to be a little subculture of their own, and super friendly. I also got lots of approving nods whenever I got out of the car, almost exclusively from men (I'm also a man). It was nice

Why I'm now seriously reconsidering getting a Tesla:

* the ""smart"" FSD is pretty shit. From constantly asking me to change lanes for no good reason to taking highway exits in a way that woke up everyone in the car, it's not even close to being useful
* the auto-parking caused the first damage to a car I was ever responsible for in 20 years of driving. I was reverse parking in an underground garage, saw the ""P"" and went for it. It turns out big-brain Tesla was trying to park between 2 cars, disregarding the massive concrete pillar right next to the spot I was getting into. I braked as soon as I realised what was going to happen, but it was too late
* the relatively small scratch/dent set me back A$3,000, which is a fuck load of money. Apparently it will also take the owner ages to get fixed, which sucks
* back to the first point, I don't love Elon's ""selling the dream/ the future is just around the corner"" sales pitch. I feel the FOMO as much as the next monkey-brained person, but fuck that tactic
* finally, competition is heating up from people who make decent cars for a living. Personally I have my eye on the Ioniq 5 and the ID.4. I don't care much for the performance part: I'm a ""chill mode"" kind of driver, and the best part of driving a Tesla was when I didn't have to do any driving. If other brands do the highway driving part half-decently and don't charge an arm and a leg for repairs, I'm in

I'm not discarding getting a Tesla, but I'm definitely less spell-bound. It's really hard to find balanced views online: it's either fanatics or naysayers. I'm neither.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,c0e6oz,How Owning a Tesla Changed My Life,"Many of us here talk about the features of our cars, the newest firmware update, the little problems (and sometimes big), and nuances of owning and driving a Tesla.  But I want to shift the conversation for just a moment and speak to how owning a Tesla has impacted my life as a whole.  I emphatically encourage anyone else here to share your story, good or bad, as well.  So here goes...

&#x200B;

I commute about 3 hours a day in heavy LA traffic.  Next to NYC, it's probably the most grueling nightmare of lane changes, starting and stopping, praying to the Gods of Sidestreets that you can make it home with a fraction of your sanity still intact in the US.  The HOV lanes are a small reprieve at times, but often just as congested as the regular ones.  On any given day, most of us that live here probably in jest wish for a quick death to end it all just so we don't have to sit in another hour of traffic; yet somehow we prevail to drive another day.  We drove our dumb cars, in dumb traffic, with dumb people, and even dumber gas prices.  This was our plight, and yet we were resigned to it, even though with every breathe we said ""Dear Lord, why me?  What did I do to deserve this?""  We returned home fatigued, haggard, with barely enough energy to cook a good meal for ourselves or our families.  We fell asleep during movie night with our significant others because the road took what life we had left in us at the end of a long work day.

&#x200B;

Then Tesla came around and offered me an alternative.  While not perfect by any means it was light years better than what I'd ever experienced.  I've driven all sorts of beaters in my life, but my last was not what one would consider an uncomfortable car to drive.  My old 335d dutifully got me from point A to B while trying it's best to smooth the bumps in the road, however it was still a comparably a dumb car despite it's price tag.  When that car caught fire and burned to the ground because of a recall issue, I vowed to be brave and try something different.  Out of this wanderlust came my Model 3 LR AWD; a technological marvel.  I work in tech and can discern what's good and just mediocre.  From day one hopping into the frying pan of traffic and enabling the AP, I found a freedom I never knew before.  Throughout the long stretch of the 405 in LA it did nearly all the heavy lifting.  It kept me safe by ensuring I was the proper distance behind traffic to avoid rear ending someone, which is sometimes a challenge because of a vision depth perception issue I have with my eyes.  I no longer awoke in the morning dreading the day, the drive to and from work.  I trusted that this car, quiet, efficient, safe and smart would deliver me to my job and allow me to work to my full potential.  By the end of the day I immediately noticed that I had the energy and mental acuity to better tackle my tasks as a father and husband at home.  Even though it's been only a couple months of owning a Tesla Model 3 the nights where I told my daughter I was too exhausted to play Shopkins with her, or tell my wife that I didn't have the energy to cook us a good dinner is a thing of the past.  I'm so much happier now, and so are the people around me that I love the most.  Yes, there are sometimes little glitches.  Sure, sometimes service has lagged when I needed it.  But all in all, if I had to slap down the same amount of cash down on a car I'd buy this one again in a heartbeat.  I have the deepest amount of gratitude to Tesla for what it's given back to me; my life.  I have faith that it will only continue to get better over time with Full Self Driving, OTA updates, and improved service.  But what it's given thus far is so much, and means the world.  I never expected or thought that something as simplistic as a car could have such a deep impact on my life, but when it comes to my family and my ability to have what I need at the end of the day to give them what they are worth, it means everything.  Thank you, Tesla, and thank you Elon Musk for your vision, and your perseverance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/c0e6oz/how_owning_a_tesla_changed_my_life/,xtheory,204344.0,0.998
TeslaMotors,would buy if,ic8ct2,Awful customer experience,"I'm gonna try and make this is short as possible to not sound too much like a whiny bitch, but I never thought buying a $60k car would suck this much.

When taking delivery and spotting all the defects, the delivery rep told me ""don't worry they'll fix everything, just take photos of everything and make a service apt though the app"". I spotted so many things wrong that the app wouldn't even let me upload all the photos for 1 service appointment. So I made 2. Of course I had to wait over a week(past the window for returning the car) for my 1st apt.

Fast forward to today when I show up 10 mins early for my apt. I check in at a jam packed service center without any room to park. A few mins later I get a call from the service rep telling my apt is not for another 4 days. I say ""no, it's today. I'm looking at it right now in the app. You want me to send you a screenshot of it?"". He says, ""That's weird, okay I'll grab a guy and head over to you"".

Turns out my first appointment had been deleted by their system everywhere but on my app, along with all the photos I had submitted. So now I'm left trying to convince them that all these paint, alignment, headliner, leather, and glass issues where there when I picked up the car. Luckily I had not deleted the photos off my phone and they were dated.

We proceeded to mark all my concerns outside in the blazing heat with barely enough room around the car to maneuver. It was up to me to find all the photos on my phone in the direct noon sun, while they deflected most of my concerns with very carefully worded statements like ""we'll definitely check all these things out and make sure they are within spec."" and, ""You should definitely talk to someone about what they said to you at delivery"".

After becoming irritated and fatigued by the sun, trying to find all the dozens of spots that I had photos of, and their robotic canned answers, we concluded with, ""We're gonna need at least a few days, is there someone coming to pick you up?"".
What?! I replied ""Uh, no I'm expecting a loaner"". He replied with ""Sorry all our loaners are gone and there's a long waiting list that I can put you on. I can give you Uber vouchers"".

So here I am, fresh from spending 30 mins confined in a stranger's car during a pandemic, fielding questions about ""who I'm going to vote for"" and, am I going to take a vaccine ""designed by Bill Gates to control the population?"". I'm also fairly certain this guy thinks you're supposed to clean leather with cologne.

Right now I've got no vehicle, no idea if they will actually fix my car, possibly infected with covid 19, and absolutely stinking of cologne. This is enough to say ""never again"".

TeslaMotors,would buy if,nt2qkb,"I've been doing some more reverse engineering again and here's what's next for the Tesla App, Tesla Insurance and the FSD subscription.","Hi there.

I'm /u/Callump01. I get bored from time to time and love to reverse engineer stuff, and recently I posted some details [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/iw6z9r/did_some_reverse_engineering_on_the_app_and_tesla/) that officially confirmed an FSD subscription was in the works, which was then widely covered on [Teslarati](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-fsd-subscription-mobile-app-leak/), [Tesmanian](https://www.tesmanian.com/blogs/tesmanian-blog/fsd-subscription), [Fr24 News](https://www.fr24news.com/a/2020/09/tesla-prepares-to-launch-full-self-driving-subscription-sets-deadline-for-enhanced-autopilot.html), [Electek](https://electrek.co/2020/09/20/tesla-full-self-driving-subscription-deadline-enhanced-autopilot/) and a bunch of other news sites. The original post was validated by the moderation team shortly after posting, so I hope this lends some credibility to the below updates that I've found and will be talking about here.

# Tesla App Updates - Tesla Insurance, 'Safety Ratings' & 'Simulator'

* **Tesla is implementing insurance directly into the app** and it will have its own section for you to view your insurance details.
* **There will be a new 'Safety Ratings' section of the app**, an early image of which can be found [here](https://i.imgur.com/Dziq8yn.png) however this doesn't show you much as it currently does not function for multiple reasons and I couldn't get it to load no matter what I tried. There are many other indicators that tell me that this is still early in development.
* The safety rating page will track your vehicle and is linked directly to your insurance. It will show the number of hours you've driven, how often you use AutoPilot, ABS events, forward collision warnings, autosteer strikeouts, accelerator variance, and many other metrics on both a per-trip and monthly basis which you'll be able to see in a neat graphical interface. You are given a 'pass' or 'fail' rating (though it is unclear whether that rating will be visible to the end user) and, from what I can tell, appears to be exclusive to HW2 and above and software version 2021.4.12 is required.
* **There will be a new 'Simulator' section under Tesla Insurance**. The simulator will allow you to adjust factors below to see how they impact your Safety Rating. Estimated Premium is calculated on a per vehicle basis using the coverages and limits of your current policy.
* Factors which affect your premium, titles and tooltips:

1. ***ABS Activation*** *- Number of times ABS is activated*
2. ***Hours Driven*** *- Average daily driving time*
3. ***Forced Autopilot Disengagements*** *- Number of times Autopilot is disabled due to ignored alerts*
4. ***Forward Collision Warnings*** *- Number of times car detects a potential forward collision*
5. ***Unsafe Following Time*** *- Portion of time spent at an unsafe following distance*
6. ***Intensity of Acceleration and Braking*** *- Speed variance due to extreme acceleration and braking. Shown on a scale from 0-10 as measured against Tesla's internal fleet.*

* Performance indicators are based on an average for that factor. The more factors you get into the green the more you'll save on your premium. Your actual premium will not change more than 50% in a month based on your driving behavior.

# FSD Subscription

* **Significantly** more work has been completed around in-app subscriptions. It looks very near completion with the 'cart' system now finished off and they have added some bits around the payment processor. This looks very very close to release with finishing touches now being applied.
* It looks like **you'll be able to refund a subscription within a set timeframe**, much like you can with upgrades, and you'll be prompted to provide feedback on why you're doing so to the team - it's important to know that this is a *request,* however.
* There will be a ""weekend mode"" and ""travel mode"" - no further details on what this actually is.
* **The only option codes currently listed for subscriptions are $APF2 (FSD Activated) and $CPF1 (Premium Connectivity)** so, at the moment, it doesn't look like you'll be able to 'Buy now, pay later' for any other upgrades such as acceleration boost or enhanced AutoPilot.
* **Billing periods are ONLY rolling monthly at the moment.** There does appear to be sections of code that does reference setting up 'billing periods' though and I have received a separate report from a source elsewhere that you'll be able to subscribe to FSD for much longer and shorter periods (one week, one month, six months, etc)
* **There will be a fancy new subscriptions page** that lets you toggle auto-renewal, updating billing address/details, download PDF invoices etc, though this is kind of obvious.
* S**omething about adding a spending limit to your card**... not sure what this is about but it's the first that I've seen it. Is this existing functionality anywhere at all? Does make me wonder if Tesla would ever be planning to charge FSD on a per-mile basis as this section is inside the FSD subscription page and doesn't appear to be related to supercharging. I'd like to make it clear that **this is a complete guess on my part and no evidence supports FSD being billed on a per-mile basis**, although I can't see why spending limits would be there otherwise.

It is likely that I'll have more specific details around FSD subscriptions shortly and I'll post an update on Reddit and Twitter once I have.

Hope that was interesting!",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/nt2qkb/ive_been_doing_some_more_reverse_engineering/,Callump01,40856.0,0.9285
TeslaMotors,would buy if,rpvjtr,V11 interface theory...it's for first-time Tesla owners more than anything.,"The v11 interface has plenty of stuff for long-time Tesla drivers like the blind spot camera and light show and so on, but it's the interface changes that are bothering us.

Perhaps the biggest complaint is that things that used to be right there on the bottom bar are now hidden in a menu (sometimes two layers deep).

After using it for a bit, I have a theory about why things are the way they are. With the ""apps"" being draggable, that sort of makes sense...they're preparing for a future where there are more apps. Perhaps an app store, or maybe just more apps and services. 

But with the controls, I think this release is acknowledging that the ""new Tesla owner"" experience can be a little confusing and the company clearly plans for there to be a LOT of new customers over the next year or two. They're at a 1M/yr run rate now and have two plants coming online in the next 3-4 months.

When someone buys their first Tesla, as I did a year ago, it's a little confusing how some things are on the bottom bar, some things are in the main car screen menu, and some things are in submenus. It's not clear which controls you can work from the steering wheel and which only work on the screen. 

This release, for all its faults, does two things well. One, it puts pretty much all the critical driving stuff on ONE screen. You tap the car icon, and all the things you need while driving are right there. There's more on that screen, it's a better use of space, it's clearer for first-time Tesla owners. Odds are if you want to know ""how do I [common car thing you do while driving]"" it's on that screen when you tap the car icon.

If you ever use the screen to do something you can do with the steering wheel, a little tutorial popup appears to tell you how you can use the knobs on the steering wheel (like if you skip forward on a music track or adjust the volume). I don't recall ever seeing that before.

I think they've got a little work to do, sure. Showing dual AC controls when the AC isn't split is more confusing than not and takes up valuable space. They could allow a few more icons on the toolbar, they don't need a ""recently used apps"" section, and if they let us drag most common controls down there instead of just apps it would solve nearly all problems.

But I think, from the 30,000-foot view, this update probably makes the ""first time Tesla"" experience a bit less confusing. And it seems to me, with the huge number of anticipated first-time Tesla owners over the coming year or two, that may have been a primary motive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/rpvjtr/v11_interface_theoryits_for_firsttime_tesla/,jasoncross00,73389.0,0.6708
TeslaMotors,would buy if,ceftpj,2 weeks with my first Tesla (MX): NOT the best car I've owned.,"Every car I've owned since my ¬£220 ford escort estate right up to my ¬£30,000 Audi S5 convertible has been in several ways better and a lovely evolution of my car experiences.  Faster, more comfortable, better tech, better build quality.  Every car has been a better car in some way.   I work extremely, save up, and get the rewards with a better car.

&#x200B;

I was expecting the same with Tesla.   I was wrong.

&#x200B;

Had I got the Jaguar F-PACE SVR (or Porsche Cayenne Turbo) that I wanted to get instead, it would almost certainly be a better car in many ways, just like my previous upgrades. Tesla, however, is not  a better car.  It is totally demeaning to suggest so.  Yes, it's better, but it's not in the same league as ""a car"".   Yes ok it has wheels and you can drive it around like you do a car, but other than that the experience is something completely different.    Yes it's (MUCH) faster,  yes it's nice inside but... that's really it.   It doesn't drive like a car, it doesn't act like a car.

&#x200B;

I wake in the morning, open the app and remind myself where I parked it, I check to see that it has been updated and what new features it has, I check to see how much is ""in the tank"" and then I check the temperature and if too hot or cold I ask it to prepare the temperature for me as I shower.  I walk to the thing and the door opens for me and I sit in, it closes.  A huge glorious screen reminds me what meetings I have on for the day as the seats and steering wheel jiggle me into my favourite driving position.   I talk to it and it brings up a load of music I want it play.   I tell it where I want to go and the glorious screen gives me a load of options I can either call or just drive to.   I then start driving.  Without having to turn the thing on by pressing a button or inserting a key.  It just drives.   But driving is an unfair description in this case - it doesn't drive the way I know it, it kind of glides.   I sit there in silence as I glide around effortlessly.  A grunting muscle-car revs his dinosaur at me at the lights and within seconds he's a spec in my rear mirror as I glide away at what should be terrifying speeds in a car, but feels like teleportation in this thing.  Teh throttle isn't a throttle it's a teleportation pedal. Press it and you get instant torque and are where you want to be in soothing silence.  Before I know it I'm on a slightly wider road (no not a motorway, just a simple A or B road) and I flick autopilot and I'm just sitting there looking around at the scenery as it twists and turns and take  me through traffic. I flick through radio stations and discover new music in the meantime.   I get to my destination, glide into my space, get out the car and the doors just all close and it locks itself up. \[this isn't made up this is all a daily actual experience\]

&#x200B;

For anyone who doesn't have a Tesla this all seems like exaggeration of little perks, but it's not, it's basically all amounts to a  completely different experience.

&#x200B;

This is not a car, it feels like some sort of UFO type thing.  Some sort of robot beast you sit in that happens to have wheels and use them on the roads.   Drives don't feel like drives they feel like robot teleportation experiences.   They are so much more relaxing, and when I want it to be, they're sooo much more fun too, like when I humiliated a Jaguar F-Type on windy roads on Saturday.

&#x200B;

This is why this feels NOTHING like my previous experiences of just getting a better car. This thing is no more a car than the best smartphone is an old wired-in landline telephone.   An iPhone bears the name phone but in truth it's a palm sized portable PC and camera that can also make calls.   I've left cars behind.  This is a technological beast or ""robot"" as my daughter calls it, that has wheels, moves on the road in a majestic way and resembles what we used to call cars.  I've not got a better car, I've now got a Tesla.

&#x200B;

Welcome to the future! :)

*Bloody hell, I'm overwhelmed!  I was rambling along in a break after a thought I had on my glide to work this morning, expecting this post to get 10 views, 3 comments and get moved/deleted.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,e0muf4,"I love CyberTruck because it's basically a big middle finger to ""pretty"" consumer trucks masquerading as utility vehicles","Having had time to process my experience with CyberTruck, I've decided it's my favorite Tesla product to date, even more than Roadster 2.

CyberTruck is pure utility. It exposes other trucks for effectively wearing makeup and trying to look pretty. There is not much function of curvy special stamped panels mounted to an internal frame, beyond aesthetics. So Tesla is not even trying to play in that rat race. 

The exoskeleton is very first principles. Maximize the function of the skin/body by making it double as the frame. There is almost no way to still make that cheap to manufacture AND look pretty, so they build all this sci-fi cyberpunk hype to glorify and celebrate its weird AF look.

I love it because they totally outflank the traditional game. It's so uncompromising, basically a big middle finger to consumer culture trucks masquerading as utility vehicles, destroying the ""ICE truck tough-guy"" marketing strategy that competitors rely on.

EDIT: I said *consumer* trucks, not work/contractor trucks. I understand workers may still prefer traditional open bed style so they can carry bigger racks and such. But most F150s today are not for work/contractor purposes. And  CyberTruck would probably still do pretty good as a work truck. Has a large 6.5ft bed, has the same freight attachment points used in airlift industry, can power electric and pneumatic power tools, has a fully enclosable and lockable bed for security, and if that's not enough, it could tow any custom work trailer. Not to mention reasonably priced.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/e0muf4/i_love_cybertruck_because_its_basically_a_big/,WhiskeySauer,127741.0,0.9769
TeslaMotors,would buy if,gzdnlc,Would you reccomend buying a Tesla if supercharging was your only option?,"So, I put in my reservation for a cybertruck recently, since FSD is going up in price again. After I paid, it occurred to me that since I live in an apartment, supercharging is really my only solution. I know they say that it's bad for your battery to just use the superchargers but at the same time most of us don‚Äôt have the cash to buy a house and a Tesla.

My current car is old enough to vote so my next car will likely be my last car if trends continue. I would prefer that my next car be electric. Rivian is selling almost exactly what I want but currently, in my eyes, Tesla is the only company worth considering almost exclusively because of the charger network. The possible solar panel add on is also very appealing and might just solve a portion of my charging problem if it can indeed put 15 miles back on the car every day. Also the new battery chemistry that‚Äôs coming may moot the battery issues.

Anyway, long winded way to ask if ya‚Äôll think it‚Äôs worth getting the car if supercharging is all you got?

&#x200B;

EDIT: My commute is only about 16 miles round trip So that means charging at least once a month assuming a 300-mile range. Both work and home are a reasonable distance to a charger. The one near work is right behind a Safeway so I could make use of the 30-40 min charge time. It was just put in like a year ago so it‚Äôs at least the v2 charger possibly v3. The one near home is in a plaza with a bunch of nearby restaurants so I would have places to kill the time so I‚Äôm not just sitting in my car for an hour.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/gzdnlc/would_you_reccomend_buying_a_tesla_if/,ZiroCool,3500.0,-0.453
TeslaMotors,would buy if,caljv3,Drove a Tesla model 3 for the first time yesterday. Holy balls.,"I scheduled a test drive about two weeks ago and drove 2 hours yesterday to finally experience the car I‚Äôve read so much about. I gotta say, holy shit! Better than I could have ever imagined! Handling was perfect(didn‚Äôt get to try out sport steering option which I regret), acceleration was crazy, it was like I was constantly in the 6k rev range of an ICE car but without the annoying engine sounds that accompany that. The ride was comfortable, lots of room in the back and the glass roof just makes the car feel so much bigger. Also made sure to look at the panel gaps that people complain about and I guess this one just didn‚Äôt have that problem as I saw no difference between the model 3 and the Audi parked next to it. Though they did have some older model s that did seem to have some weird gaps. I could say so much more about this car but I‚Äôll just say that it exceeded all of my expectations. 

On a side note, I brought my parents with me and my dad also got to drive it. He would not shut up about it on the way home. ‚ÄúThis car is the future‚Äù and ‚Äúif I‚Äôm gonna buy a new car, it‚Äôs gonna be from the guy who builds rockets‚Äù. They were also super surprised that the guy who drove with us didn‚Äôt try to sell the car afterwards. I tried telling them that Tesla doesn‚Äôt have dealerships but they were convinced that there would be some sales tactic involved. 10/10 experience.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,eztiow,FordPass‚Ñ¢ Charging Network VS. Tesla Charging Network,"I have a friend who is a ""Ford guy"", and every time I talk about Tesla, he ""throws in my face"" that Ford has the largest charging network in the country. Ignoring the fact that you can't even buy a fully electric Ford at this point (Mach-E isn't available yet), I wanted to try and get to the bottom of this claim.

The Culprit: [Official Ford announcement ""North America's Largest Electric Vehicle Charging network.""](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2019/10/17/ford-introduces-north-americas-largest-electric-vehicle-charting-network.html)

Several media sites have created their own articles based on this announcement, that Ford has the largest network of EV charging sites. This is very misleading because if you go to [Ford's EV charging locator map](https://www.ford.com/buy-site-wide-content/overlays/try-the-tech/), you'll quickly discover that their ""network"" of chargers are simply [Chargepoints](https://www.chargepoint.com/), [Electrify America](https://www.electrifyamerica.com/index), [Greenlots](https://greenlots.com/), and other third-party charging networks. **Ford has zero exclusive charging stations.**

Most of the charging locations in the FordPass‚Ñ¢ Charging Network are public stations where you can ***also charge a Tesla***. *(EDIT: Some people have pointed out that Teslas can't charge at ALL of the same chargers as the Mach-E, for instance, due to adaptor restrictions.)* Therefore, Tesla clearly has the largest network of chargers when you add their Supercharger and Destination charger network. Ford is implying that they have a superior exclusive network over Tesla, and that's just false. All they did is pay these companies a licensing fee so they can call their chargers part of the FordPass‚Ñ¢ Charging Network. The only benefit offered by Ford is two years of ""access"" to the network, but you still have to pay for all your electricity. *(EDIT: Some people have mentioned that the Ford network offers a discount on charging at these stations, but I haven't found a source to back up this claim.)*

>Ford is providing two years of complimentary ***access*** to North America's largest network ‚Äì the FordPass Charging Network ‚Äì for easy and convenient ***pay-as-you-drive*** charging.

I don't even see a benefit of ""complementary access"", because [Chargepoint membership is free](https://www.chargepoint.com/drivers/), and it gives you access to 80% of other Level 2 (AC) networks and 99% of DC fast chargers. You pay for the electricity, of course, just like you would through the Ford program. 

Am I missing something, or is this a blatant low effort marketing tactic?",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/eztiow/fordpass_charging_network_vs_tesla_charging/,joeyisnotmyname,72528.0,0.9254
TeslaMotors,would buy if,y2bwo8,Things I wish my Model 3 had,"I have a 2020 M3P with over 50K miles on it and have driving across the USA several times and here is what I'd like to see in no specific order or priority:

\- Bring back radar, Vision SUCKS. Way more phantom braking events, and autopilot slows down in foggy conditions when with radar it did not. Also, radar would show cars in front of me 2 or 3 deep, now with vision, all I see is the one in front on my visualization screen. Although, vision seems to do a better job at lane-keeping. So, a hybrid radar/vision might be best. It‚Äôs so bad that I rarely use autopilot anymore because when I do, I‚Äôm always on edge, ready to unintentionally brake check someone at a moment‚Äôs notice. You know a function is badly designed when the user is incentivized to NOT use that function. One of the biggest reasons I and probably most people bought Tesla was because of autopilot, and now it‚Äôs degraded to the point of not using it. 

\- Implement a dumb cruise control that only keeps the speed constant like every other car. I don't want phantom braking and making people angry behind me who think I brake checked them, I don't want to slow down in foggy conditions or around curves, I don't want lane keeping, I don't want distance keeping, I don't want 85 MPH to be my top limit. I just want the speed kept constant as if I had my foot on the accelerator and nothing else. 

\- Allow switching of accelerations speeds by tapping the ""chill"" word, just like tapping the battery changes it from % to miles. Or have different driving profiles available at the tap of a button, like the M buttons on BMW M cars. I don‚Äôt want to change my entire Driver profile to do this. 

\- Fix the music UI where half the song's name and band can't be seen even though there is plenty of real estate in the music bar. Show the time/time remaining in the song instead of just having the status bar at the bottom. 

\- Allow us to turn on/off the driver and passenger HVAC independently. I know you can change temps on both sides independently, but sometimes I just want mine on when there is not passenger or when my passenger doesn't want air in their face without having to change the direction of the air flow every time. 

\- Speaking of HVAC, for the love of God get rid of that stupid SLIDER to change fan speed. It‚Äôs thin and very hard to use while driving. It obviously didn‚Äôt go through real world driving tests. Go back to having large + or ‚Äì buttons to change it. In fact, make all buttons large and easily accessible and get rid of any sliders anywhere. 

\- Get rid of the auto-wipers and auto-high beams when in autopilot. I hate when I have no control over functions of the car. If vision requires both to be on, then vision isn't good. Go back to radar and keep ultrasonics. 

\- If possible, give the M3P a slight acceleration boost, even if at the top end. There used to be a large gap between the M3P and M3LR, which is what distinguished the two and why people paid a premium for it. Track mode is a nice distinction, but not enough. The acceleration boost for the LR was a money grab and diminished the value of the M3P. I know they don't want to eat into Model S sales, but people who get the Model S/X are probably more into the luxury aspect that pure speed (I could be wrong). 

\- Go back to the Apple IOS style UI/Icons and not this Android looking one. It doesn't fit the aesthetic of the car. 

\- Allow customization of how many ""clicks"" a turn signal includes. 3 is way too short

\- Allow us to have different ‚Äústyles‚Äù of UI. For example, I could have a Road-trip style, which increases the map size and gets rid of the 3D car animation. I could have a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù style, which shows speed and gear and that‚Äôs it. You get the idea. Many cars do this already by emphasizing speed, or RPMs, or oil pressures, etc. on their digital displays with the click of a button. 

\- In addition to Chill/Normal/Sport/Ludicrous modes, have a purely ECO one where all but necessary functions are turned off to maximize range and efficiency. 

\- It was nice allowing us to change the color of our 3D model, but if we added assets for aftermarket taillights or other wheels, that would be cool. It could even be something others create, and we can upload via thumb drive. It‚Äôs weird to see my 3D model with the wrong wheels and taillights since I got both replaced. 

\- Why is the walk-away door lock sound the horn honking? Tesla‚Äôs have external speakers, so make it a pleasant locking sound like other EVs do and not this loud obnoxious honk. Even the reverse humming sound is more pleasant than the honk. I hate coming home at night to my apartment and having my car honk. I could turn off the walk-away door honk, but that isn‚Äôt the point. I shouldn‚Äôt have to not use a function because it sucks. That is indicative of the function itself needing fixing. 

\- Allow retrofitting for powered frunk/trunks, new center console, heated steering wheels, and other upgrades just like they are doing with the CCS adapter. In fact, my Tesla SC is installed the newer side repeaters because I asked them to. They don‚Äôt suffer from the blinkers blinding them at night and have better low-light visibility. It‚Äôs a $350 retrofit though. 

\- Tesla needs to be more open to and more responsive when allowing other auto shops to buy Tesla parts. My go-to auto guy could not get certain parts from Tesla SC no matter how many times he reached out. But when I scheduled an appointment with the SC, they magically had the parts ready to go. 

\- STOP removing functions in a car I already paid for. This is the double-edged sword of OTA updates. We get more cool features and more power, but on the flip side, we lose some functionality like radar and ultrasonics. Imagine buying a cellphone with certain functions and later the manufacturer removes some of those functions even with the necessary hardware still installed. Now imagine some of those functions were big reasons you bought the cellphone. And you have no say in rejecting these updates or risk being out of warranty. Totally unacceptable for a $50k plus car. 

\- If Tesla removes features in an update, they should refund the owner for said removed functions. Like removing Alcantara headliner on later Model 3s. Now it‚Äôs this cheap beige fabric garbage. Not ‚Äúluxury‚Äù at all. Or removing radar/ultrasonics. I paid for that hardware and functionality and dammit I want to use it. 

\- Why are some features on my state-of-the-art electric vehicle not available that are available on some other cheap cars? Ventilated seats? 360-degree vision? Lowering the sound when a phone call comes in? 

\- Need more factory paint options. 9/10 Teslas I see on the road are white and it‚Äôs so damn boring and monotonous. Wraps are expensive and don‚Äôt last forever. A full paint job is even more expensive. 

Overall, amazing car in its totality, literally revolutionary. I know all the above fixes can‚Äôt and likely won‚Äôt be changed, but you never know. Some might be hardware and software limited in some way I‚Äôm not aware of, but then again, I‚Äôm not a Tesla engineer. This is coming from purely a user experience perspective.

I hope this is ok. It's about life. I really wanted to join this forum. 
This might be a long read. Not sure if this is a rant. Maybe a scream maybe a life tip.

I actually still have my 1000 deposit with Tesla since 2018.
Its been hard to say yes to a test drive because I know if I did I would of bought the car the same day.
I know everything about the Model 3 I see all the YouTube videos.
Read the forum almost everyday. Thanks to all the experience I read here.

I been wanting a Model 3 + for two years I have been saving $.
Been close to buying it quite a few times.

This summer was it I can put down 25% and have monthly payment of car and insurance of below 20% of my monthly income I was set. 

With COVID 19 I was going to wait since I'm working from home.

Unfortunately It's not meant to be. I have cancer now. Life is different. Life is short. 

Got medical bills so until I fight this the car will have to wait.

I will be doing a test drive for my Birthday. At least. Pretty excited.

Enjoy life. Enjoy the car.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,eixpak,The tax situation in The Netherlands explained (why over 29.969 Model 3s were sold in 2019),"In the past weeks a lot of news about Tesla sales in The Netherlands were reported, and every article pointed to the tax increase starting 1 January 2020. It's quite a complicated system, so as a Dutch citizen I thought I explain.

In The Netherlands it's fairly regular that your company provides a car via lease. However the Dutch tax authorities see this as a form of income, which is taxed. We just simplified our income tax brackets as of January 1st 2020, which makes it a little bit simpler luckily.

**Principle**

So let me introduce you to *Bijtelling*, an added income tax for lease vehicles provided by companies (not only cars, since January 1st you can also get company bicycles!). The Bijtelling is different for different kind of vehicles, for non-zero emissions (ICE) cars it's 22%, for bicycles 7%, and for EVs the following values are used:

|Bijtelling|2018|2019|2020|2021|2022|2023|2024|2025|2026|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|For EVs|4%|4%|8%|12%|16%|16%|16%|17%|22%|
|EV discount cap|n/a|50.000|45.000|40.000|40.000|40.000|40.000|40.000|n.v.t.|

So what do you need to do with that Bijtelling? You need to multiply the purchase price times the percentage and add that to your income (which is taxed). So if you lease a ‚Ç¨40.000 ICE the treasury sees that as ‚Ç¨40.000 \* 22% = ‚Ç¨8800 extra income. A ‚Ç¨2000 bicycle results in ‚Ç¨140 extra income.

EVs have a discount to stimulate the transition. Up to 2018 this was for the full value and fixed at 4% (which made S and X very attractive), since 2019 a cap was introduced for the discount. So in 2019 for the first ‚Ç¨50.000 of the car 4% bijtelling was added, the additional value the regular 22% was added. In 2020 8% for the first 45.000, etc.

**Examples**

Let's compare values for Alice and Bob, who earn 3 times and 1.5 times the modal income and see what difference an EV in 2019 and 2020 makes (modal income is ‚Ç¨ 35.500 for 2019).

As of January first we have just 2 tax brackets: over the first ‚Ç¨68.507 income you pay 37,35% tax, over anything more you pay 49,50%. So additional income (bijtelling) for Alice falls into the 49,5% bracket, for Bob it's still in the 37,35% bracket.

A Tesla SR+ costs ‚Ç¨49.000 in The Netherlands, a LR AWD ‚Ç¨59.000. So the Bijtelling would be:

|Bijtelling|2018|2019|2020|2021|2022|2023|2024|2025|2026|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|SR+|‚Ç¨ 1,960|‚Ç¨ 1,960|‚Ç¨ 4,480|‚Ç¨ 6,780|‚Ç¨ 8,380|‚Ç¨ 8,380|‚Ç¨ 8,380|‚Ç¨ 8,780|‚Ç¨ 10,780|
|LR AWD|‚Ç¨ 2,360|‚Ç¨ 3,980|‚Ç¨ 6,680|‚Ç¨ 8,980|‚Ç¨ 10,580|‚Ç¨ 10,580|‚Ç¨ 10,580|‚Ç¨ 10,980|‚Ç¨ 12,980|

For Alice, this extra income falls in the higher 49,5% bracket, This would mean the following additional extra yearly taxes:

|Alice|2018|2019|2020|2021|2022|2023|2024|2025|2026|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|SR+|‚Ç¨ 970|‚Ç¨ 970|‚Ç¨ 2,218|‚Ç¨ 3,356|‚Ç¨ 4,148|‚Ç¨ 4,148|‚Ç¨ 4,148|‚Ç¨ 4,346|‚Ç¨ 5,336|
|LR AWD|‚Ç¨ 1,168|‚Ç¨ 1,970|‚Ç¨ 3,307|‚Ç¨ 4,445|‚Ç¨ 5,237|‚Ç¨ 5,237|‚Ç¨ 5,237|‚Ç¨ 5,435|‚Ç¨ 6,425|

And for Bob:

|Bob|2018|2019|2020|2021|2022|2023|2024|2025|2026|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|SR+|‚Ç¨ 732|‚Ç¨ 732|‚Ç¨ 1,673|‚Ç¨ 2,532|‚Ç¨ 3,130|‚Ç¨ 3,130|‚Ç¨ 3,130|‚Ç¨ 3,279|‚Ç¨ 4,026|
|LR AWD|‚Ç¨ 881|‚Ç¨ 1,487|‚Ç¨ 2,495|‚Ç¨ 3,354|‚Ç¨ 3,952|‚Ç¨ 3,952|‚Ç¨ 3,952|‚Ç¨ 4,101|‚Ç¨ 4,848|

The bijtelling percentage is fixed for 5 years, so if you buy it in 2019 you get the lower tax for the full lease contract (4 and 5 year leases are the major majority in The Netherlands). It can save you more than ‚Ç¨1000 a year for 5 years in tax discount!

I hope these explanations and examples shed some light on the high Tesla sales in The Netherlands, and why add the end of 2020 and 2021 we will see more of those end of year pushes. And remember this whole story is only for company cars, not privately purchased cars. Feel free to ask any questions!

TeslaMotors,would buy if,kyrn4y,"Delivery Manager says I hold their cars to a ""high"" standard and should look at other brands","Our family purchased our first Tesla, a 2020 Model Y Performance at the end of August 2020. I think the vin is 47,xxx and paid $110 CAD in cash after taxes. I was extremely happy to purchase a Tesla after a considerable time and was wanting to purchase our first EV.

On delivery there were several issues or defects with the car to which the delivery manager had created a list and he noted it on their system through their phone. He promised all of these issues would be fixed very quickly and that I have no reason to worry since they've recorded it in their system. I would get an appointment with the body shop they work with very soon. (Pushing for their end of Q sales numbers to increase). It was not feasible for me to reject the car and potentially waiting weeks-to-a-month because my previous car was written-off from the insurance company because someone rear ended me. And the insurance company doesn't cover the cost of a rental more for than 5 days so I had been paying out of pocket for a rental over a period of a month waiting for my Tesla.

&#x200B;

Well, I've spent the last 6 months trying to get these issues fixed from delivery. The service team won't even touch the issues and says the delivery team is looking after them, which is fine since I had reported it to the delivery manager. I've had over 20 email exchanges about these delivery defects with the manager and have been asking for 6 months when would these issues be resolved for my new car. After 6 months I receive a call from the body shop saying Tesla only authorized them to fix 4 out of the 9 defects that are on the car. At this point I was considerably upset because I've spent the last 6 months of my time trying to get these issues resolved quickly only to be told a couple would be fixed. I thought this might be a simple mistake so I send 3 more emails over a period of a couple weeks to the delivery manager that had the delivery person and sales person cc'd this whole time. One month and a half goes by and not a single response from anyone, not even to say they might be on holidays and that I will receive a response soon, nothing.

When I sent a final email mentioning that the Pearl White bumpers on our car are yellowing and this is a known defect that many people have had resolved by Tesla for their white cars. I receive an email from him a month and a half later saying that the bumpers yellowing are completely normal (although not a single of my previous white BMW and cars yellowed, ever). He said I need to work with the service team (but the service team has been telling me I need to deal with the deliver team). 

Furthermore, saying that I should consider other brands that have higher quality closer to the standard that he has seen me hold their cars too. I only met him once in person on delivery day and that was when I did the walk around checklist like every other single buyer has had to do because Tesla doesn't care to have a quality control standard or team that other normal car companies do prior to the customer purchasing their cars. Then saying their cars will not hold up to the quality specifications I'm looking for in my next vehicle purchase. 

I don't understand how have I held high quality specifications and how are my standards ""high""? These are the issues I've been trying to get fixed that were noticed  on delivery day:

1. Re-attach spoiler from coming off
2. Realign tailgate
3. Paint chips on tailgate
4. Realign right rear door
5. Realign left rear door
6. Realign left rear side trim
7. Repair dent on front hood
8. Realign fender to A-Pillar
9. Replace rear diffuser due to large scratches present on delivery
10. Repaint front and rear bumpers that are yellowing (noticed after delivery)

&#x200B;

Other than these body shop issues, I have taken the car to service multiple times to fix over 30 issues that have been confirmed in my service invoices.

&#x200B;

IMO, horrible customer service and insult to injury by saying I have high standards when all I've tried to do is get these issues fixed. Clearly these issues don't even meet normal standards of a car being $110K. Yeah they have great tech and driving experience but cannot meet a normal expectation of no damages and defects on a new car, why. Could you imagine if you had to deal with this?

Apologies for the huge write up, just wanted to provide some context.

Update Jan. 20/21: I did not expect to get so many upvotes. Thank you. Sorry everyone I've been extremely busy with work since I created this post. I understand the concern that I've not uploaded any proof of images, I will do so this weekend. I would like to emphasize it's not just about the car and defects.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,17haazu,1 month in on Tesla ownership...,"So I've been a Nissan customer for years, and when I went to lease my new Maxima, they wanted 675 a month with 1,000 down. I went to a friend that owned a Chevy dealership and the prices were not much better. As a joke, I called Tesla dealership near me and they explained I had to get the app.

48 hours later I was at the dealership picking up my new Tesla.  Never once have I drove or even sat inside the car for a ride.  Just bought it blind and showed up to pick it up.  I LOVED buying a car without slimy sales people, but was scared I made a mistake not even test driving or seeing the car I bought in advance.

Well, it's been a month and here are my thoughts:

1) In most ways, this Tesla (Model 3 base) is the coolest car I've ever had. It has more features than my previous Nissan Maxima Platinum decked out car. I love the app controls (which Nissan also charged a ton extra for and did less). It is like driving  a car of the future...I previously owned 3 different Nissan 350/370z's and this car is equally as fast as any of them.

2) Gas vs Electric.  Because of where I live (apartment) I'm forced to use supercharging stations.  There are a couple nearby which makes it easy.  I HATE the fact that it auto sets it to 80 percent charge and you have to override it manually.  I once ate some ""idle"" fees while at 80 percent which I feel is unethical as I would have been back in time if they actually charged me to 100. I know I can override it, but to make me pay more while not charging me to full is a joke. 

Also, while on this topic, I have saved zero dollars switching from gas to electric.  This is not only confirmed from my bank statements, but the Tesla App on my phone confirms that my ""savings"" are 0 dollars.  My job is only 4.7 miles away yet regardless of how careful and slow I drive, the battery always goes down at least 8 or 9 miles to get to work. Something seems defective or dishonest here...

3) Trunk.  For some reason I can not figure out how to open my trunk without going into the App.  I keep the credit card key in my wallet, but why the hell can't I just press the button on my trunk to open it when close??  Ok, this one is petty....but still annoying and I'm sure I'm doing something wrong lol.

4) Toughness:  A full grown deer rammed into the side of my car out of nowhere last week.  I mean, it full out hit me from the side and I was convinced there was a bowling ball sized crater in my passenger side door.  The Tesla camera (really awesome!) caught the deer hitting me, and the rear cam caught the deer rolling behind my car after impact.  Don't worry, I went back and the deer was fine.  Even more impressive, my car hardly had a scratch from that massive impact.  You can tell where it hit if you look close....but no serious damage at all!

I love the car and feel like I'm driving in the future.  I'm sure I'll discover even more cool tricks as time goes on.  I'm just a little bummed out about not saving more money for electric.

Also, what is the deal with no spare tire? If you get a random flat you just sit there on the side of the road until help arrives to tow your car??? Was this car built for a generation that isn't able to change a tire? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/17haazu/1_month_in_on_tesla_ownership/,CastingObsidian,278.0,0.9724

Tesla Makes Offer to Acquire SolarCity



Tesla‚Äôs mission has always been tied to sustainability. We seek to accelerate the world‚Äôs transition to sustainable transportation by offering increasingly affordable electric vehicles. And in March 2015, we launched Tesla Energy, which through the Powerwall and Powerpack allow homeowners, business owners and utilities to benefit from renewable energy storage.



It‚Äôs now time to complete the picture. Tesla customers can drive clean cars and they can use our battery packs to help consume energy more efficiently, but they still need access to the most sustainable energy source that‚Äôs available: the sun.



The SolarCity team has built its company into the clear solar industry leader in the residential, commercial and industrial markets, with significant scale and growing customer penetration. They have made it easy for customers to switch to clean energy while still providing the best customer experience. We‚Äôve seen this all firsthand through our partnership with SolarCity on a variety of use cases, including those where SolarCity uses Tesla battery packs as part of its solar projects.



So, we‚Äôre excited to announce that Tesla today has made an offer to acquire SolarCity. A copy of Tesla‚Äôs offer is provided below.



If completed, we believe that a combination of Tesla and SolarCity would provide significant benefits to our shareholders, customers and employees:



We would be the world‚Äôs only vertically integrated energy company offering end-to-end clean energy products to our customers. This would start with the car that you drive and the energy that you use to charge it, and would extend to how everything else in your home or business is powered. With your Model S, Model X, or Model 3, your solar panel system, and your Powerwall all in place, you would be able to deploy and consume energy in the most efficient and sustainable way possible, lowering your costs and minimizing your dependence on fossil fuels and the grid.


We would be able to expand our addressable market further than either company could do separately. Because of the shared ideals of the companies and our customers, those who are interested in buying Tesla vehicles or Powerwalls are naturally interested in going solar, and the reverse is true as well. When brought together by the high foot traffic that is drawn to Tesla‚Äôs stores, everyone should benefit.


We would be able to maximize and build on the core competencies of each company. Tesla‚Äôs experience in design, engineering, and manufacturing should help continue to advance solar panel technology, including by making solar panels add to the look of your home. Similarly, SolarCity‚Äôs wide network of sales and distribution channels and expertise in offering customer-friendly financing products would significantly benefit Tesla and its customers.


We would be able to provide the best possible installation service for all of our clean energy products. SolarCity is the best at installing solar panel systems, and that expertise translates seamlessly to the installation of Powerwalls and charging systems for Tesla vehicles.




Culturally, this is a great fit. Both companies are driven by a mission of sustainability, innovation, and overcoming any challenges that stand in the way of progress.


Today‚Äôs offer to acquire SolarCity is only the first step toward a successful combination of Tesla and SolarCity. We will provide a further update if and when an agreement is reached.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/4p6zxb/tesla_makes_offer_to_acquire_solarcity_official/,FredTesla,163135.0,0.9993

This wasn't a performance version, but man what a kick in the ass that car is. It was up to 100mph is nuthin' flat. I can't even imagine what driving a Plaid must be like.. 

We dropped by the Superior, CO location while I was on my lunch break. Like a Crack Dealer, Tesla doesn't really ""sell"" these cars but ""offers"" them. The rep we spoke with did the usual walk around of a floor model. We immediately got a massive laugh out of the ""Romantic Mode"".  My wife was giggling like a school girl.  

So my other impressions/questions. 

* Man this thing really has A LOT of cargo space. That was very surprising. 
* The seats take a little getting used to but man that white is something else. If I get one, I think I'll go for a blue exterior with those white seats.
* No CarPlay is kinda disappointing, but this is mostly because there is no Waze to warn me of any cops ahead. That is something I'll miss but my wife pointed out that the phone sits nicely on the charging pad and we could still run Waze on that. I was thinking it would be cool if AutoPilot could look down the road and give you a heads up if it notices a police car. It could also tell you if one comes up behind you from a highway on ramp. 
* Obviously the car was super quiet on the highway but the tires and suspension do transmit a lot of noise into the cabin. 
* No spare tire is a little concerning. I'd like some feedback on that. The Tesla rep did a great job of explaining why. That was very reasonable and roadside assistance would help with any tire change. But what if we're in Colorado's mountains and out of cell phone coverage. How do we get service at that point? Also, do they repair a tire with minor damage right there or do they give you a loaner wheel and tire? I'm looking for any gotchas.
* I'm sure lots of people say this, but regen braking will take some getting used to. Especially since our other vehicle is a Jeep Wrangler. 
* Does anyone know if the Model Y can handle a rooftop tent with two or three people? I have an iKamper xCover, which may be a bit too big. I haven't investigated this yet. 

On Monday I get to check out a Ford F150 Lightning. I've got an early reservation for one, so I'm fairly sure I'll have the option to actually order one. I also have a Cybertruck reservation but that's a very late one so I don't think I'll be able to get one for quite a while. I may buy an F150 and keep it for a couple years, then get a Cybertruck. But after driving a Model Y, I may say screw it and lease that for a while before getting a CT. I will probably have to make a decision soon on the Ford. Orders are expected to open this fall. But man, what a fun car that was to drive. I totally get the attraction to it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/pp1hxd/first_time_driving_an_ev_holy_moley/,SergeantBeavis,31924.0,0.9935
TeslaMotors,would buy if,85ajxa,A detailed review of Model 3 from a M3 owner.,"Context: I'm currently a happy owner of an [F80 M3](https://i.imgur.com/kplaltD.jpg), and over the years I've owned a [F30 335i](https://i.imgur.com/edTsvFR.jpg) and an E92 335i. I've driven pretty much all the cars in this segment, namely the BMW 3-series, the C43 AMG, the Audi S4 and S5, and the new Alfa Romeo Giulia.

Well, today I was able to borrow [this baby](https://imgur.com/qFXj4Nq) and spent a day driving it on mountain roads, within San Francisco, and cruise it down 101. Here are my impressions. I'm going to score individual categories relative to other competitors in this class, so I won't be rating the Model 3's cost against a Civic, its luxury against a S class, or its handling against a 911.

**Drivetrain (9/10):**

Modern ICE drivetrains are quite good, especially in the premium sports sedan segment. Max torque reached at very low RPM from the new turbo engines, silky smooth shift from the ZF-8 gearboxes, and some of them even manage to sound good (i,e C43 AMG). But the Model 3 beats pretty much all competitors in these categories (ok maybe not sound), with 0-30 performance that feels as fast as my M3. Instant max torque at 0 rpm and no gear shift makes this car a performance star around town, especially in local driving. One point is deducted due to Model 3's power/torque falls off quite noticeably at around 55 mph and above. Still not slow by any means, but do lag behind some of the competitors in this segment.

**Steering (8/10):**

The Model 3 has really direct steering that's quite nicely weighted (more so than the Model S), and even has a bit of that steering feedback many modern cars with electric racks lack. The ratio is not as stupidly quick as the Alfa Romeo Giulia (maybe a good thing), but felt very comparable to my last 335i. Two point being deducted for the steering weight doesn't increase in a predicable linear fashion as you keep turning. It does get heavier as turn-in increases, but not as much as I'd liked and it doesn't provide as much confidence near the limit as the best in this class.

**Suspension/Chassis (9.5/10):**

Yep, that's an almost perfect score, and in my opinion as a sports sedan, the Model 3 is among the cream of the crop in this already sporty segment. It manages to be supple *and* sharp at the same time, and is able to offer some good feedback from the road without trying to set you up with your local chiropractor. It's obviously not as hardcore/razor sharp as my M3 (and no, it doesn't make the Giulia feel like ""wet sponge""), but it's extremely well balanced and reminds me of BMW's best days. 

Some people may find the ride a bit too ""harsh"", but I personally applaud Tesla for having the courage to make a sports sedan actually sporty, instead of just making a land yacht with good acceleration. BMW, maybe you should use some of those SUV profits to build actual ""Ultimate Driving Machines"" again.

All of this is combined with the low center of gravity from the battery pack, which resulted in probably the least amount of body roll in this segment. However it's not a perfect 10 because weight *can* be felt at higher cornering speed and it was obvious the car's tires are quite limiting factors.

**Interior Quality/Fit and Finish (5/10):**

Before I talk about anything else, I want to bring up the steering wheel, or rather how ugly it is. The [Model S](https://images.hgmsites.net/lrg/2013-tesla-model-s-4-door-sedan-steering-wheel_100466393_l.jpg) has a handsome and premium looking steering wheel, my M3 has [real aluminum trim and contrast stitching leather](https://imgur.com/a/Tkqkx), and the Audi S4 has a steering wheel that resembles [that of a racecar](http://image.superstreetonline.com/f/144382304+w+h+q80+re0+cr1+ar0+st0/2017-audi-s4-live-interior.jpg). Meanwhile the Model 3's steering wheel looks like an [afterthought](https://i.imgur.com/uzXoU7W.jpg) that Tesla engineers reluctantly put in last minute because they couldn't get Full Self Driving to work.

Interior materials were decent. The wood trim felt premium, but was marred by aluminum colored plastic around it. Most of the plastic were soft to touch and the synthetic leather felt ok as well. But this segment is extremely competitive and even [KIA](https://i.imgur.com/tISHJNh.jpg) started using top end materials everywhere. Minimalism is a design choice that's subjective, but material quality is an objective benchmark where the Model 3 is definitely falling short to the class leaders such as the [C class](http://www.mercedescla.org/forum/attachments/28929d1471300833-cla-interior-vs-c-class-mercedes-c-class-salooon-2014-door-panel-detail-frontseatdriver.co_.uk_.jpg). (Yes, every piece there are real aluminum, including the window switchers, and the speaker grills are laser drilled aluminum as well.)

I personally thought the $5000 price tag for the PUP is quite outrageous for what you get. For that money you'd be buying into [BMW Individual Program interiors] (http://cdn.bmwblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/F80-M3-Individual.jpg). In comparison the full leather interior upgrade of my M3 was a ""mere"" $2k.

On the other hand, build quality was solid and the only rattling I thought I heard turned out to be the zipper of my jacket. Much better ""feel"" than the Model S from the earlier days. Also door pockets and rear cup holders man.

**Technology/User Interface (Exclude Auto Pilot) (2/10):**

This was definitely by far the lowest point of my experience. The car was very bare bone as far as features go, with no heated steering wheel, no HUD, no surround view camera, and one of the worst sound system I've heard from this segment (seriously, mid-high range sound very flat and even distorted at higher volume). 

Then there is the center display, which was responsive and high resolution by itself. But the problem was the interface itself was a complete mess. One cannot even adjust side mirrors without drilling down into the menus while driving. Bringing up the odometer of the car was a puzzle game by itself. The passenger couldn't open the glove compartment when I was trying to setup Bluetooth with my phone. Navigation itself was fine, but the UI was dangerously unsafe since the turn-by-turn instruction was to the far right side of the screen, with small fonts on top of an alpha overlay. Coming from [what I currently have](https://i.imgur.com/vBjVrq8.jpg) it was just infuriating.

And by the way, [this happened twice](https://i.imgur.com/chrYRpQ.jpg) to me on the short drive up to San Francisco. Once it happened when I was trying to get to the menu to adjust my side mirror. Thank Elon for Auto Pilot.

Which brings us to...

**Auto Pilot (10/10):**

The best driver assist in this segment, bar none, end of story. Is it perfect? Not even close. Is it the best money currently can buy? By far. 

I would be lying if I said I didn't miss my M3 on the drive up to San Francisco. But after grabbing a late dinner with friends and I drove back on the boring 101 at night, I would be lying if I said I didn't wish my M3 had Auto Pilot.

**Overall Impression:**

I was impressed by the Model 3. It wasn't perfect, but is definitely without a doubt one of the strongest entries in the crowded luxury sports sedan segment. It does have some unique issues but it also has the unmatched value proposition of the sportiest EV on the market (yes, this car is a lot sportier than a P100D Model S). 

This may very well be my next daily driver, if there is room in the budget for it along with a [718 GTS](http://st.automobilemag.com/uploads/sites/11/2017/12/2018-Porsche-718-Cayman-GTS-front-side-in-motion-01.jpg) :)

The Model 3 is not a true sports car. It is not a real luxury car either. But for 99% of the people out there who can work an EV into their life, it is a *very, very, VERY good* car. The Model 3 is probably not *the* best car in this segment, but I also cannot say any competitor is clearly better. Tesla's first effort in this segment manages to trade blows evenly against the best.

P.S.

The 3 settings for the heated seats seemed to be...

1.	Somewhat warm.

2.	George Foreman.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,zr8rrm,Apple Music on Tesla appears to use the HE-AAC codec at 64 kbps. Explanation and testing inside.,"I got off my arse and did some very simple testing. It is my opinion that Apple is using the HE-AAC codec at 64 kbps when streaming Apple Music via the Tesla UI. My testing methodology and results are below.

##Methodology

* iPhone 14 mobile hotspot
* [Hotspot Monitor Data Usage](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hotspot-monitor-data-usage/id1037580658) from the Apple app store, to monitor data traffic.
* 2019 Model 3 on 2022.44.25.1 (we also have a 2021 Model Y on 2022.44.25.3 but I haven't seen an indication that bitrates were adjusted between these versions)

From there, I would monitor the data usage of the car while streaming music. I would match the data usage per song up to Apple's claims to see which codec is likely being used. [Per the Apple Music settings, it says (for a three minute song):](https://imgur.com/a/gRt5Qib)

* 1.5MB for HE-AAC (64k)
* 6MBfor AAC (256k)
* 36MB for Lossless (ALAC)
* 145MB for Hi-Res Lossless (24-bit/192kHz)

##Results

Through multiple songs I observed the same pattern - A burst of data as the next track began, then a trickle of data throughout the song. It appears to buffer most or even all of the song, then pause between tracks to do it again. On average, I saw ~2MB per track, with ~1.7MB during the initial burst and ~0.3MB throughout the track. This is consistent with the HE-AAC standard, as most of these songs were a little over 3 minutes in length.

This leads me to believe that Apple is using their HE-AAC codec at 64 kbps.

##Possible Questions/Concerns

(I'll update this with good questions from the comments)

**Q: How can you be certain that Apple is using HE-AAC and not another codec?**  
**A:** I can't be certain, but it's a reasonable guess. Apple uses very specific codecs for their 4 quality settings for Apple Music. Tesla's UI streams via Apple Music. It would be highly unlikely for Apple to make a codec unique to this one specific application given the size of their catalog. ~~That said, it's certainly possible that they have a hidden lower setting (32 kbps?) for embedded applications such as this.~~See the last question.

**Q: Could they be using a higher bitrate over LTE?**  
**A:** Not likely. There is no benefit to nerfing the bitrate over Wifi compared to LTE. There is benefit to nerfing it over LTE, as Tesla bulk buys data for their premium connectivity subscribers, and the incentive is to get as much out of it as possible while using as little as possible.

**Q: Ok, but why does it sound so much better to me?**  
**A:** 1) You're in a car, not an isolated and quiet listening environment. It's virtually impossible to tell the different between high quality lossy and lossless compression in such an environment. Secondly, [multiple listening tests (notes 10-13)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Efficiency_Advanced_Audio_Coding#cite_note-10) have shown that users cannot tell the difference between HE-AAC at 64 kbps, and MP3 via a high quality encoder at 128 kbps, even in isolated environments. Both Apple and Tesla likely felt that this was ""good enough"" for automotive use, and Tesla has incentive to minimize data consumption for their premium connectivity.

**Q: Would it be better for me to stream over Bluetooth? And if so, should I use high-quality (256 kbps AAC) or lossless?**  
**A:** 1) Premium connectivity is a convenience that you pay for. Using Apple Music over BT will yield higher sound quality and, if that's the only reason you had premium connectivity, it will save you money. 2) If you use high-quality (AAC 256 kbps), it will play back using AAC over BT, so you should lose no additional quality going from phone to car. If you use lossless, there is debate if it would transcode to AAC or SBC. Best case, you're introducing a non-zero amount of additional battery drain for no benefit (AAC), worst-case is you get SBC and it sounds slightly worse. Use High Quality.

**Q: Is it a Tesla, AT&T, or Apple limitation that we can't have offline storage and higher bitrates?**  
**A:** Of the three, my personal bet is on Apple limiting the choices, and Tesla choosing the lower of the two, but this is highly speculative. But I'll try to source it. Apple allows for the embedding of Apple Music via JavaScript. Tesla uses JavaScript for much of their UI and app interfaces. So it's a safe bet that Tesla is pulling from that. [Per this link](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/musickitjs/musickit/playbackbitrate) (thanks u/smithre4), Apple Music's embedded application(s) only support streaming (no offline), with bitrates set to HIGH (256 kbps) or STANDARD (64 kbps).",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/zr8rrm/apple_music_on_tesla_appears_to_use_the_heaac/,OverlyOptimisticNerd,225642.0,0.9852
TeslaMotors,would buy if,rttvyu,"2 year review of my Model 3 - The best car I've ever driven in the day, the worst at night","Hi everyone,

Welcome to my 2 year review of my Model 3 Performance, built around September 2019, picked up in November 2019 at Manchester-South (Knutsford) service center in the UK.

Through this review I want to cover my general experience, I won't be including any specific numbers as quite frankly I don't have them and nothing I paid for that was expensive felt like it was the car's fault and something I needed to keep track of. :)

So... I'll sum it up into different categories, these are: Charging, Range, Reliability, Maintenance, Service Center experience, and Gripes.

**(If you're looking for the explanation for this post's title, I'd jump straight to the 'Gripes' section)**

Lets start!

&#x200B;

**Charging:**

This is actually a pretty simple one. It's not a problem and never has been one.

My charging is split roughly 50/50 between home charging and Supercharging. At home, I have a third-party 20 meter charging cable running from a wall outlet, through 2 cat flaps, down my driveway, then into the car. This charges at about 2.5kW I believe, it takes about 16 to 20 hours to charge.

For Supercharging, it's generally about 25 minutes. I live near Tebay services, for anyone in the UK you probably know this place and love it as much as I do, I actually end up going here for a meal and charge whilst there. Usually I'm just finishing my drink as I get the 'Supercharging nearly complete' message. Perfect timing!

For Supercharging away from my local area, it's never been an issue. I've road tripped my car down to Monaco, this was a round trip of around 3,000 miles. For this, I used entirely Superchargers and never had a single broken stall, nevermind a whole broken station. In my 2 years of ownership I've only ever experienced 2 broken Supercharger stalls, extremely reliable and reduces the worries that you might arrive to a broken charger!

On the other hand... The only time in my 2 years of ownership that I've had to use something other than Superchargers was doing the 'North coast 500', this is a road trip around the north coast of Scotland. The only chargers on the route past a certain point are 'ChargePlace Scotland' ones, these SUCK. Every other one is either partially or completely broken, it is a range-anxiety inducing nightmare. Thank god the Supercharger network is so vast that I never have to deal with this again!

In my ownership, I've always charged the car at around 30% and up to 90%. Though I don't track degradation, I haven't noticed any difference in range. It's probably there but if I can't notice it, then there's honestly no issue. I feel this is the case for most people, the vast majority aren't plotting this. I display battery remaining in percent as the miles remaining has never once been right so it's honestly utterly useless.

&#x200B;

**Range:**

Note that this is a 2019 Model 3, before the heat pump was implemented.

With that said... I'd say my average range in the summer is about 240 miles. If I'm driving like a moron on backroads, probably less. (I did buy the 'Performance' model for a reason after all!) - On average, the outside temperature in my part of the UK during the summer is about 16c. (60f)

In the winter, I'm probably lucky to get 150 miles. This is mainly due to more rain, more wind, and it just generally being colder. I will say that as of recent software updates the cold barely affects my regen anymore though! I'd say on average the outside temperature in my part of thje UK during winter is about 9c. (48f)

When I was road-tripping through France down to Monaco, it was a blistering 39c (102f!), with this my range was all the way up to around 290 to 300 miles! Amazing! Sad to say I'll never see thay in this country though... :)

Regardless, this range has never been an issue. I've averaged 322wh/mi over the 22,000 miles I've driven. Even with this, I still get to family who is about an hour away, drive to other people's houses that are 10-15 minutes away from there, and get home on a single charge quite easily. For road trips, I generally stop about every 2.5 hours of driving for a 25 minute break to charge, use the bathroom, grab a snack, stretch, etc. - This is not a concern at all for me.

&#x200B;

**Reliability:**

Oh no!? Reliability!? But but but... The build quality! It must be falling apart right!?

Yeahhh... No, it's fine. Drivetrain has been absolutely flawless considering I launch it on literally every single drive, this is usually once a day or every other day. (Launching is addictive, if you've driven on you can relate!)

Durin the whole 2 years of owning the vehicle I've never had a single issue affecting the drivability of the car. Thoigh I have had a few software issues, like one showing a turn signal fault which was fixed by me getting out of the car and back in.

How about the build quality though? Well... It's Fremont, I don't know what you expected, but, it's certainly no China build. The paint is pretty thin, it's getting pretty destroyed around my rear wheel arches and on the front bumper, I should have got PPF really. I'll be totally honest: The China-built cars are *amazing*, all the panels are aligned, the paint is noticeably better, and overall they have less issues according to my mobile service technician.

I will say the panels are aligned fine though! Though some trim pieces were lose, my mobile service tech who was coming to check a rattle went around clipping them all back in. (Covered under warranty though so I can't complain!)

&#x200B;

**Maintenance:**

Uhh... Tyres? (Tires?)

I guess that's it. Moving on.

&#x200B;

Just joking, but really that is about all I've done to the car. At around 16,000 miles I replaced both rear tyres, then had to replace a rear one 500 miles later as it got a nail stuck in the edge of the tread. Don't worry, they're only Michilins most expensive tyre, *I'm not depressed about that or anything.* (Amazing tyres though! Well worth the price for the traction they provide!)

I've topped up the windwhield washer fluid maybe twice, the tank for it is HUGE and lasts forever.

No need to change the wipers yet, still going strong with no streaking at all.

&#x200B;

Here's a run down of my service center visits, or, mobile service visits:

\- Interior trim rattle. (Covered under 'Goodwill', free)

\- Passenger window replacement. (¬£110 I believe? Mobile service was covered under 'Goodwill'. The window got scratched all the way up by a rock that got stuck in the seal - On this same visit they also checked the power steering harness for any water ingress and re-enforced it as that's apparently a known issue on my age of car)

\- Tail light replacement. (Due to condensation, I didn't really care about this as it clears after driving a little, but my dad kept bringing it up every other day he'd visit, so alas... It got fixed. Covered under warranty, mobile service under 'Goodwill', so all free!)

\- Headlight alignment. (Covered under 'Goodwill', free. I'll explain this more in the 'Gripes' section as it's quite an annoying and long story - Whilst at the service center they also re-lubricated the upper control arm joints and re-sealed them, this was to avoid a potential squeaking issue apparently)

&#x200B;

**Service Center experience:**

As I work from home and largely drive my car for fun more than anything productive, some of the visits I made to the service center were simply to get out of the house and do something useful for once, some could have been mobile service instead.

Though... Every time I've been to the service center it has been a great experience. Tea, Coffee, and some snacks to eat whilst you wait. The service center sales staff are great and love to have a nerd out about Tesla stuff. When I was in for my headlight alignment I was chatting about FSD Beta with them and we were both nerding out about wanting to try the yoke steering, and expressing our concerns about parking with it of course. We came to the conclusion it'd be fun to try at least. :)

Upon collecting the car there's always a friendly person from the service department who comes and explains what was done and is always happy to explain anything in detail if needed.

For mobile service, I've had the same guy each time, I gave him hand holding stuff whilst he was working and got to have a fun chat with him about my road trip around France and he was telling me about places he was planning to stay in my local area and about his own personal Model S 100D that had been into an accident when someone side-swiped him.

Overall... I've never had any poor experiences at my local service center. They're a great bunch of people and whilst I was in for headlight alignment (On the 24th December!) I overheard that they'd got a bunch of gifts from customers. I'd thought about bringing one but didn't want to seem weird! I guess I was the odd one out by not bringing one instead. :)

&#x200B;

**Gripes:**

Alright... So this is the part you're probably looking for, the explanation to the title.

In the daytime, I absolutely love the car and it's a joy to drive. Great fun on backroads, absolutely smokes anything on the road, and the acceleration kinda makes me want to throw up, but in a good way!

In the night time... Ugh... It feels like any minute I could crash and not even realise I was about to hit anything.

Lets split this up into the 3 main causes of that: Headlights, auto high beam, automatic wipers.

&#x200B;

Gripe 1 - Headlights:

I've seen on US videos that the headlight alignment is basically straight ahead, there's not really many headlight laws there. It's just a free-for-all with hopes that anyone can see the road through the glare, or, you just buy a bigger vehicle than everyone else and screw over anyone in a smaller car by blinding them instead of them blinding you. **Nice.**

In Europe... We're a bit more civilized and opt to use technology instead of simply pointing the headlights higher. (Apparently US laws are changing to allow some of this tech some time soon?)

So lets do a quick comparison of 2 cars, to show part of the issue here. My 2019 Model 3 Performance (¬£52,000!), versus my dad's 2014 Peugeot 308 (Like ¬£30,000 new?)

Tesla vs Peugeot... Fight!

Peugeot, the cheap French brand: Headlights adjust based on the angle of the vehicle, have a very strict beam pattern so they can shine as far out as possible and as high as possible without affecting other drivers, spotlights (Fog lights) turn on to see around corners better, headlights generally have lots of spread so visibility to the sides is generally great.

Tesla, the premium brand: Headlights are static so they have to be pointed lower as not to blind people when going up a hill, beam pattern is not strict at all so they need to be pointed lower to not blind others, headlights have pretty terrible visibility around corners as they have little spread and don't adjust for corners at all or turn on the fog lights for corners.

I really don't get it... 2019 and this is the state of the headlights...? I understand in the US these got some kind of award for being great...? Did they not bother to research the European market before releasing the Model 3 here?

Now here's the really annoying part:

*The headlights don't stay in the same place each drive.* Lets say you manually adjust the headlights to be higher up, so they shine at people's number plates instead of literally 1 car length ahead (No joke, this is what I had before manual alignment, and what Tesla just aligned it back to), you'd think the whole point of headlight alignment is to align them, right?

Wrong! Get out of the car, get back in and they'll move to another position. Maybe they point at the ground and you can't see anything whilst driving, maybe they point to the sky and cause everyone to flash their headlights at you. Who knows!? Lets spin the 'Wheel of fortune' to find out!

See TeslaMotorsClub forum in the UK section for a bunch of people complaining about this same experience. I imagine it's a software bug, maybe some kind of gyro-drift causes it? Who knows, either way, it needs fixing. It's annoying for other drivers and annoying/dangerous for myself.

**EDIT:** Here's a picture of the low beam versus high beam, this is 1 day after Tesla aligned them. Go watch a US video of a Model 3 and compaare, you'll see my problem pretty fast. :)

[https://imgur.com/a/2jE7E5D](https://imgur.com/a/2jE7E5D)

**UPDATE:** Of what I've gathered from comments, people in Europe largely agree with the statements I made here, whereas US users do not. To be clear... These issues mentioned here are caused by the EU headlight alignment and lack of advanced headlight features that are common amongst other vehicles sold in the EU and UK. Manual alignment could resolve this issue, but it has a software bug that causes it to reset the alignment when entering the vehicle on a slope.

&#x200B;

Grip 2 - Auto high beam:

If I wasn't a software engineer and understood the issue a bit better, I'd assume they trained the auto high beam model on images of retroreflective signs instead of car headlights.

How is it that on a single drive the high beam can turn off for EVERY sign at the side of the road, but not a single car until they've already flashed their lights at me?

Some people say it has improved with the FSD Beta. Maybe improved vehicle detection has helped with this, I'm not sure what the underlying logic is but right now it's absolutely horrible.

This combined with the broken European headlight alignment means I can come around a corner then suddenly go from seeing 10 car lengths ahead to literally 1. This is absolutely terrifying if you're doing 60mph around a corner then it suddenly sees the sharp corner arrow signs and turns off your lights mid-turn.

I've turned off auto high beams now as it's frankly more problematic than it is useful. When there's a lead vehicle it does a great job at turning off for them, just a horrible job at everything else it needs to do... :(

Gripe 3 - Auto wipers:

Lastly... The cherry on top! Camera-based automatic wipers.

Credit where it's due, in the day these work great and I only have to push the manual wipe button once or twice per drive, if that. In the day, they work far better than ones in the vast majority of other cars, regularly getting just the right amount of wiping to not be annoying.

At night... I mean... How do you know the difference between rain and just a black sky? This seems like a major oversight. I live in a rural area in the UK where there's no street lighting for the most part and very low light pollusion. Dark is very dark.

The autowipers simply don't work in the dark. Once you get street lighting they start functioning pretty well again, but 90% of the time you're sat there trying to drive whilst spamming the manual wipe button as you don't have time to look away from the road to use the on-screen buttons for changing wiper speed.

(Why doesn't this use the scroll wheels like in the refresh S/X? This makes 10000x more sense!)

&#x200B;

Conclusion of the gripes:

As a result of the above gripes... Here's my general night time driving experience if it's raining:

\- I can see 1 car length ahead with the low beam.

\- Every corner I approach causes the auto high beam to flash off for several seconds then back on, making that 1 car length all I can see. On roads I don't know well this makes the corner kind of jump scare you as the high beam turns on you're doing 50 still into a sharper than you could see turn.

\- Oh, there's a car approaching? All I can see is RAIN, let me keep spamming the manual wipe button whilst threading the needle with the 1 car length of lights I have and trying to slap the wiper speed I want on the screen. Heaven forbid there's any road debrid, pedestrians, dogs, or anything else I need to see ahead of me. (Voice commands aren't fast enough to use really)

Honestly... I'm not being extreme herre. It's dangerous and stupid. It makes absolutely no sense to me why these issues haven't been a higher focus. I guess because the main software engineers are in sunny California where everything is already lit and corners are just 90 degree intersections? I really don't know, but they **seriously** need to focus on Europe. Really hope Elon's so called improvements for Europe coming in March are actually helpful.

&#x200B;

**Overall conclusion:**

Against what the gripes might suggest... I absolutely love my Model 3 Performance. It handles great, the sound system is great, the charging network is great.

Never drive at night? You're golden, not a problem at all for you. But me? I drive at night a lot, I work with a lot of Americans so my day starts at like 4PM and most of my driving is in the dark.

Regardless of the gripes... I'd still highly recommend the car to anyone! I just wish Tesla would focus their efforts in places that are important for other countries (and other states...), it seems like Europe is largely forgotten unfortunately, with the software becoming more crippled over time with no real improvements in sight.

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the updates like the blind spot camera, live sentry mode camera access, the various cold weather improvements, and the general ease of ownership and the service experience. My 2 years of ownership have been amazing, there's just a few things that are extremely questionable. :)

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading my review! I hope it doesn't come across too harsh!

Let me know if you have any questions, or, if you have experienced any of these issues yourself. I'd love to discuss this and know if the newer Model 3's with the new headlight design experience similar issues in the dark. :)

&#x200B;

**EDIT:**

An absolute legend /u/allegory_corey has figured out the cause of my headlight alignment issues. They are lower in the EU in general, but, especially low as I park on sloped ground. It seems like Tesla is using some suspension travel sensors to determine the weight of the vehicle, if the rear is squatting down more than the front then it must be heay, right? Or, *it's just parked on a slope.* His solution is to drive onto flat ground, open then close the door, then the headlights will re-align themselves back to the correct alignment. This is pretty clearly a software bug. Please someone at Tesla, look into this. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/rttvyu/2_year_review_of_my_model_3_the_best_car_ive_ever/,curtis1149,13467.0,0.9998
TeslaMotors,would buy if,xnwstk,Tesla accessories I wish I didn‚Äôt buy,"So it seems like a common act of excitement to buy accessories during the long wait time while you're awaiting to receive your tesla. I think this is part due to youtubers pushing you towards that direction (because guess what they make money out of advertising for those sponsers!). So I'd like to list out the things I bought so that you don't make my mistake and burn all that cash. Before I go any further, I recommend not making the mistake I made and don't buy anything before you actually receive the car. Here's the list of things that I purchased, which ones I thought were worth it and which ones where not.

# Things I wish I didn't buy:

\- **[Center console cup holder cover](https://a.co/d/1hqb2fm)**: I bought the baesenor ones off the amazon. Honestly, I don't know why people buy anything to cover there. There original space (without the cover) is not that big enough as you might think. So any type of covering (of any brand) would make it difficult to put your coffee cups and stuff in there. So you end up forcing the cup into the place and there is like 70% chance that doing this actually increases the chance of spilling coffee outside that area. Which defeats the entire purpose and messes up your entire interior. Just don't buy anything and your car looks more minimal and oem and you save money too!  
(If you insist of having some protection I would only put something for the floor of that cup area).

\- **[Magsafe phone mount](https://www.jowua-life.com/en-ca/products/invisible-foldaway-car-mount-with-magsafe-charger)**: I bought the Jowua phone mount, for a rip off price. Bought it directly off the Jowua website and while they said the shipping is free they didn't mention anywhere during the checkout that there was going to be a 25% (or any) customs being added after it shipped. I would never buy anything off of their official website, beware. Aside from that, as much as I loved and used the carplay in my previous car I have never used my phone itself once in tesla. It's just unintuitive, because the Tesla UI is just awesome and has everything you need, you also save on phone data. Also I'm not sure if the magsafe charging is mfi certified and if has negative effects on your car battery draw or not. I would only buy a mount or a mount with charger if I was a uber driver. Otherwise save yourself money and space in your tesla.

\- **[Jowua Center console trays](https://abstractocean.com/products/center-console-tray-gen-2)**: I bought both. The youtubers are so gong ho on these! While the quality of them are nice, I feel like they're totally useless. They don't allow for much space as they show in the videos or pictures. I would either not buy anything and use the spacious area as tesla designed it (and just throw stuff in the the lazy way!!) or just buy the tesla OEM ones. Way better value for 1/2 or 1/3 the price. Much better use of space. The other brands (other than tesla and Jowua are just trash, don't even bother)

\- **[Jowua light bar thing](https://abstractocean.com/products/handheld-led-lightbar)**: Meh, it's cute but wouldn't buy it for the above reasons. After the first 30 minutes it becomes something you ignore. Don't worry you don't need that light as there is already great cabin lights in the cabin. And the amount of the space it occupies is not worth it in my opinion (You'd want to put your glasses there instead of that).

\- **[Jowua Game controller](https://www.jowua-life.com/en-ca/products/multi-device-wireless-controller)**: Update- Just tried the controllers, and realized the A and B buttons are revered. What the hell???? Big no! ~~I'm neutral on this. Still haven't used it one time because the only games worth my time are Sonic and Cuphead and I haven't received that update yet. The controller looks cute. But I feel like you could buy the xbox controller for half the price with much better grip (with sacricifing the cool look of jowua of course)~~.

\- **Jowua glove box usb connector**: Total rip off. Just buy it off ali express for 2 dollars. I'm 100% percent it comes out the exact factory with just different labeling, charging people 10 times more just for the branding.

\- **[Air freshners](https://a.co/d/6RFz9Fq)**: I can't spellout the name here (rhymes with tesla vehicle models names), but you probably know which ones I am reffering here (you can find them on abstract ocean). They smell amazing and very classy. But they end in like 1.5 days. So up to you.

\- **[Homelink](https://shop.tesla.com/product/model-3_y-automatic-garage-opener)**: I would probably save cash by not buying it. It's way expensive for what it is.

\- **[Tesla key fob](https://shop.tesla.com/product/model-s-key-fob)**: Don't waste money on this. The phone connection is already phenomenal, zero need for that. 

# Things I'm happy I bought them:

\- **[Tuxmat Floor mats](https://a.co/d/hv5mBlb)**: I bought the tuxmats. They are freaking awesome and worth extra penny/dollar. I don't think they even have any competition with the amount of coverage and the quality that they have. 

\- **[Spigen glass protector](https://www.spigen.com/products/tesla-model-3-y-screen-protector-ez-fit-glas-tr)**: Totally worth it. I bought the non-matte version and I think it's the one to go. It's so good you wouldn't notice it's even installed. The only gripe was I didn't find any good instructions when installing it and ended up installing it with a ton of frustration.

\- **[Tesla rugged trunk mat](https://shop.tesla.com/product/model-y-rugged-textile-rear-trunk-mat)**: I bought the OEM ones from Tesla shop (The cheaper version). It's awesome go for it. If the tux mats where a bit cheaper I would have definitely bought them because they are the only product on the market that offer protection for the lip of the trunk where you put your luggage. Or who knows, with the savings you make on the stuff on mentioned maybe you can shell out for the tux mats!

\- **[Armrest cover](https://a.co/d/2VtwK9g)**: Definitely go for it, makes night and day difference. Especially the comfy ones, and they don't cost that much (Edit, I bought the Motrobe brand).

\- **[Tesla Water Bottle](https://shop.tesla.com/product/stainless-steel-water-bottle?sku=9123515-SS-A)**: For the money I think it's worth it. Very cool and elegant design. Has exccellent ability on holding tempreture and a very nice soft touch to it. And it feels like a nice attachment to Tesla brand.

\- **[Model 3/Y Performance Pedal Set](https://shop.teslarati.com/en-ca/products/tesla-model-3-y-performance-pedal-set)**: I actually bought two sets of these. One was ""Top fit"" and the other was ""Motrobe"". Top fit was noticeably heaver and better quality. That being said both of them didn't actually seem to be real aluminum. Would be nice if someone with a performance Model 3/Y can confirm if the OEM ones are real aluminim or not. All the being said, It adds a very nice touch to the driving experience altogether. 


\- **Tesla Wall charger**: I bought it, 100% worth it. Especially with the voucher that I received from Tesla.

\- **Update 1** - Added performance pedals because I forgot 

\- **Update 2** - Wow lots of elite Homelink fans haha. I don't disagree that this is an innovative and very useful tech. My point was if you already have a garage door opener that is hidden on your sun vizor and just works, is it still justified to pay that amount of money for it?

\- **Update 3** - Added the links, even though it wasn't the general intention of this post.

\- **Update 4** - Just tried the Jowua controllers for the first time and realized the A and B and X,Y buttons placement is reveresed.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,6eur3w,I was on the fence about keeping my Model 3 reservation but US withdrawal from Paris accord and Musk leaving White House committee has steeled my reserve... I'm not buying another gas car,"I'm concerned about potential service issues with Tesla as I live in a state with currently no Tesla service center, so I thought about not going forward with getting a Model 3. I reserved on day one and am a huge Tesla fan but I can't afford to have car problems that are difficult or lengthy to resolve. 

But with my country pulling from the Paris Climate Accord and practically daily shitty news rolling in about the only planet we have, I'm feeling like fuck it, I'm going to roll the dice and take a risk on it. All in. 

We need to start making more sacrifices, too, financial and otherwise. Driving a Tesla is only one small part of the equation, and before anyone lambasts me for suggesting that driving a Tesla is a sacrifice, I'll address that now. Obviously driving an incredibly fun, quick car that is highly desirable is not a sacrifice, but I would suggest that people for whom a Model 3 or a Bolt or Volt is a little outside of their price range, maybe they consider making some sacrifice in some other area to be able to fit an electric car into their budget. Or maybe someone can afford it but wants something bigger for the money or wants more of a sports car or just doesn't like the aesthetics of any of the electric cars available - - maybe those people should consider making a sacrifice for the planet (and therefore our children and our species and many other species) and get an electric car anyway. There are lots more things as well that we can do, like commute by bicycle, insulate our homes better, stop buying all sorts of cheap plastic disposable shit, etc, but I won't get into all of that on this sub, and you know what to do anyway. 

I know this sub isn't supposed to be political but I really don't think that halting climate change is a political issue. It blows my mind that we're not all on the same page about this. The scientific conclusion has been made. It's literally going to be a global disaster of geological proportions if we don't dramatically lower our carbon emissions immediately. This fits in this sub because Tesla is part of the solution. 

OK. Off the soap box. Have a great day.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,rrpqsp,"1-Year Free Supercharging is Over, Here Are The Numbers, and What I Learned","I've had my 2021 MYLR for exactly one year now. At the time of purchase, I had 1 year of free Supercharging and I definitely used it for most of my charging. I downloaded the TezLab app a few days after purchase so I could track some data. I'm in Southern California where electricity and gasoline are both very expensive. Here is what the data shows (I think):

Total Miles: 14,437 mi  
Total Energy: 4,109 kWh  
Avg. Energy: 285 Wh/mi

* 84.5% of my total energy intake was from Supercharging.
* I received $1,243 in free Supercharging.
* I got 110mpg and burned 130gal equivalent.
* At $4.50/gal in SoCal, a 50MPG car is equivalent in fuel cost if using Supercharging prices only.
* Even if I paid for Supercharging, I would have saved $722 compared to my previous 30mpg vehicle.
* If I charged exclusively at home at the lowest rate in my area of $0.19/kWh, I would save $466 over exclusively supercharging and $1,188 over a 30mpg vehicle.
* Average Supercharger Max Power was 133 Kw.
* Estimated max range is now 305 mi vs the original 320mi.

I know Sentry Mode, Pre-Conditioning, Cabin Overheat protection, and other systems use energy not related to the movement of the vehicle plus efficiency losses while charging. So this data isn't a perfect representation of those factors. If I didn't use those auxiliary systems, I'm guessing my total efficiency would be higher. I'm not a numbers guy, so don't be surprised if most of this info is incorrect or the calculations are wrong.

A FEW THOUGHTS ON THE CAR AFTER 1 YEAR:

* Not being able to charge at home blows.
* Autopilot is the greatest gift to humanity. I use it 90% of the time. 
* I look forward to charging at superchargers. It gives me a legitimate excuse to stop, get food or use the restroom, or check emails/texts.
* I love how excited people are to see the car because they've ""heard so much about it.""
* The car's unique quirks bring a lot of joy to people of all types. There is something for everyone to love! Fart noises, movie watching, drawing, Santa mode, megaphone, great storage, excellent acceleration, and more. 
* I played the Christmas Light show for my mother who then started crying. She said she was so happy to be alive in an era where technology was capable of such things. I then started crying as well. 

Is this the greatest car ever made? No. But I can confidently say that it brings the most joy to the most amount of people, well over any other car, which feels priceless. 10/10, would buy again.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,4ocrw6,"CMV [serious]: If in 2018 one can buy an (almost) self-driving EV from Tesla, why would anybody even think about buying anything else?","CMV (Change my view) [serious]

We are pretty sure the 2017 Model 3 (and S/X) will have the hardware for full self-driving. 

Software will probably take a bit longer: 2018/2019 until it is really L4 capable, one more year to gather robust statistics to show it is safe (like Tesla is currently doing with autopilot v1 on the highway) and another year before we can legally sleep through our daily commute.

The chances of any other company reaching such a level of automation in that time-frame is approximately zero, because everybody except Google has not started *large-scale* real-world testing and Google has not contracted anybody for *large-scale* manufacturing.

It seems 2018/2019 there will be only one company that can sell me a self-driving capable fully electric car. So why would anybody buy any other car (*)?

We've been planning to buy a Tesla since the S came out. We've planned on never buying another ICE car. We have always planned on going electric and wanted to focus on Tesla for a large variety of reasons.

We've planned on buying the truck at some point, but thought that we would be getting a Y first and then getting the truck eventually. We thought the Truck was going to be 49k for a single motor, and we knew that we needed something probably more expensive with better towing capacity.. We will need the truck for towing a few things someday but also we just need a truck for home renovations we plan on doing. 

We're big sci-fi nerds so when we heard it was going to be something very futuristic, my wife and kids were pumped. 

So when the truck was unveiled, we were watching it as a family. It was love at first sight for all of us. Reserved immediately. It's perfect for us in every way. Dual motor. 

My friends all said: ""OMG it's ugly"" ""Not gonna buy this"" ""gonna wait for the electric F150 or Rivian"".  I personally don't think it's ugly. I love the look of it.  I also know that there's a lot of genius that went into the design that people aren't picking up on and also in the improvements/efficiency in manufacturing. 

The truck's price-point and abilities have brought us closer to some dreams that we thought were going to take 15 years to achieve. 

People can make fun of it and I laugh at the memes. I literally don't feel defensive. I'm so happy I ordered one and I have told my friends: ""For once in my life I have no fucks to give. Not a single fuck."" I don't care if you (whomever is reading this) like it, or if my friends like it, or if anyone likes it or hates it.  I guess this is what it feels like to know you made the complete right decision.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,irvzbo,"I drove the Porsche Taycan 4S for an hour, and here are my thoughts on the strengths and weakness of it against all the Tesla I've driven.","Due to some luck I had a [Porsche Taycan 4S](https://i.imgur.com/SBf9h1Q.jpg) all to myself for about an hour. As a big fan of both Tesla and Porsche, I've driven many of the modern Porsches and I've driven almost all of the Tesla models (including all Performance Model S/3/X except the OG Roadster and the Model Y. I currently DD an AWD Model 3 with acceleration boost. Here are some of my thoughts on many of the aspects of the Taycan from the perspective of a long time Tesla driver.

**Exterior design**: It's all subjective, but I think it's one of the two best looking 4 door sedan on the planet right now, EV or otherwise. Small details like the [headlights](https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/08-Headlights-of-the-Taycan-4S.jpg) just really sets it apart from the competition.

**Powertrain**: The 4S is the ""slowest"" Taycan model at *only* 3.8s 0-60. But in typical Porsche fashion it's probably a little quicker than that. It launches slightly harder than my Model 3 (3.9s 0-60 according to Tesla) but definitely won't blow away anyone who's been driving any of the Performance Tesla models. One thing I both liked and disliked was the two-gear transmission. On one hand it pulls hard at speed well north of 70mph (far quicker than my Model 3 at that speed) but despite how amazing PDK is in their ICE cars, that one shift just feels *jarring* in the context of an EV. It's barely noticeable but once you notice it, it's hard to ignore. 

Additionally, it doesn't regen nearly as hard as Tesla does when you lift foot off the throttle, that may be jarring for some EV owners but since I often drive ICE sports cars on weekends it didn't bother me. However I prefer Tesla's implementation as far as an EV experience goes.

**Handling/Chassis/Steering**: The unit I drove had PASM (Porsche Active Suspension Management) and All Wheel Steering, but did not have the physics defying electromechanical anti-roll bar system. But even then it's **by far** the best handling and best steering EV I've driven by a mile. It weights about 600lbs heavier than my Model 3 yet has less body roll, far better/natural steering, quicker frontend response, and a more compliant ride at the same time, all on All Season Tires. Considering Model 3 is the most ""sporty"" model in the current Tesla lineup, it's safe to say the Taycan is far ahead of any other Tesla models in terms of driving dynamics. 

**Interior**: Design is subjective, but it's got a pretty attractive interior. Porsche has always been known to have the best *build quality* amongst all the mass production manufacturers, and the Taycan is the same. A high end Porsche makes most mid-range BMW/Mercedes/Audi look like they are built by children in a South East Asian sweatshop, and even the Ferrari 458 Italia I drove on the same weekend had worse interior build quality. 

Material wise it's nothing to write home about though, in a typical Porsche fashion, it has way too much plastic (although high quality ones) for cars of its price point. The Model S's cabin material has always been pretty decent, so the gap isn't large here.

**Cabin insulation**: Far quieter than my Model 3, 80mph in this car on the same stretch of highway feels like 50 in my Tesla. I guess some of those extra weight went to insulation after all.

**Cabin tech**: The instrument display was beautiful, the curved instrument panel was striking to say the least. Tesla still has the *largest* touchscreens in the industry but these days they fall a bit behind in contrast and pixel density (Mercedes is probably the best these days). However [this center console screen](https://imgur.com/ebn6F3L) was **absolutely awful** and it combines the worst of physical buttons and touch screen. It's not super responsive, looks bad, requires you to press down like a physical button (and in turn it has haptic feedback), and gets really hot after a while. It's just terrible.

Btw Tesla really, *really* need to upgrade their parking camera systems. These days [3D surround cameras](https://imgur.com/OViVsEx) are pretty common on highend German cars, meanwhile Tesla still doesn't offer a simple top down view in any of the cars. Some of the other stuff ranged from very useful stuff like cooled seats to gimmicks like [night vision](https://imgur.com/Bo6IBLl). 

Porsche has always been the worst in terms of cabin tech amongst the luxury German manufacturers and the Taycan follows that tradition. It didn't even have HUD as an option (apparently the 2021 model added it). The interior tech gap between the Taycan and Model S actually isn't nearly as bad as it's between the Tesla and say.. an Audi A6. 

**Driver assist**: I've never used Porsche's InnoDrive, and this car didn't have it. It only had adaptive cruise control and basic lane keep assist. They worked well, but again these are standard features from a new Honda Civic and Porsche still charges $1200 for it. I honestly don't know why Porsche doesn't just use Audi's driver assist system in their cars.

**Range**: I drove pretty spirited during that one hour and after driving for 33 miles, the expected range dropped by only 27 miles, so Porsche is probably conservative in their range estimate here. Apparently despite 203mi EPA range, the 4S can go [264mi non-stop traveling at 75mph on the highway](https://insideevs.com/news/440424/porsche-taycan-4s-range-test-great-results/).

**Conclusion**: Great car, and has a bunch of typical Porsche pros and cons. The 4S is the Taycan trim I would buy if I were to buy one. But I won't be buying one since I don't have the budget to drop $130k+ for a daily driver. Even though I don't see Tesla being threatened by this car in any meaningful way, it's good to see EV entering new segments in the market and I eagerly await the Model S refresh. 

P.S. Talking about Model S refresh I honestly don't care too much about the Plaid powertrain or whatever absurd 0-60 time it would get, I want a new high quality cabin in a way that's *unique to Tesla*. The [bar is *crazy* high these days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bY8EcDzg3g&t=179) in terms of interior tech and luxury, I hope the new Model S plays to Tesla's strength and bring some surprisingly cool stuff.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/irvzbo/i_drove_the_porsche_taycan_4s_for_an_hour_and/,cookingboy,675127.0,0.9987
TeslaMotors,would buy if,6thyte,Interesting experience at Buena Park Tesla store.,"So I stopped at Buena Park Tesla store for a quick charge yesterday. My wife and I decided to go check out the showroom and see the new facelifted Model S and X (ultra white interior was super comfortable). A Sales advisor comes up and asks if we are interested and we say no we are just charging our Model S which we love and we have a Model 3 on the way. 

At this point the sales rep tells us we should ditch our Model 3 reservation and get a Model S.  Tells me there isn't much difference in price. Which I just gave him a silent look.  He then says a Model 3 was there a few weeks ago and whips out his phone to show me the pictures of him in the back seat. ""See how cramped we are in this picture?"" Him and another gentleman looked cramped, but they were taking a selfie and getting in picture together. Then he started bashing the minimalist cabin and how the car is really not that nice and we will be disappointed coming from a Model S. At that point I politely told him we aren't buying another Model S and a fully loaded Model 3 will be great. He then starts saying well don't get one of the first ones because those will have so many problems like the S and X. 

He tried to get in more jabs and we just walked out. Regardless of anti selling or not you shouldn't anti sell by talking badly about your own product. He could have talked up the Model S without being such a pompous ass. 

Well anyways. End Rant. But this is not a good look for Tesla and if I didn't have a Model S and I was just browsing to see what my Model 3 would be like and I encountered this guy I would have cancelled my reservation and high stepped it out of the showroom to never return.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,pmxsql,Why Tesla is struggling in Japan,"DISCLAIMER: I am aware that Tesla is a relatively new company that can't just start making 10 different models off the bat. I am also aware that they are working on a more compact model at the Chinese plant and that will hopefully turn things around.

I live in Tokyo and my family is currently considering which EV to buy. A Tesla is obviously one of the options, but the reason we're hesitant:

They're TOO FREAKING WIDE

[Model 3 at our house](https://preview.redd.it/43xj0unv34n71.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6638f7e15c3103b0f20ac3025d3baead3ec47a1)

&#x200B;

[driver's side barely opens](https://preview.redd.it/u1dsbyk944n71.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e0496febfc6572d518eeec470044c88ce814bd3d)

I know they had the Japan market in mind when they made the Model 3 1849 mm in width, but here are the problems it still causes.

1. Japanese city parking lots. Most are the kind like you see in *Tokyo Drift* where each car has its own platform, and max width is usually 1850 mm. The smallest model having a margin of 1mm necessitates some virtuoso parking skill every time you want to go shopping in your car. Models S, X, and Y aren't even a viable option for city dwellers.
2. Streets. Japanese cities are not like most US cities where the roads are straight and wide and go on for light years. Most Japanese neighborhoods and cities were laid out and densely populated (some even overcrowded) centuries before automobiles were invented, and as such have narrow roads with many bends that aren't optimal for cars to begin with. This is why makes that have a wide reach such as the Corolla have different widths depending on the market, and the Japanese market version typically has the smallest width.
3. Housing conditions. Again, it's not like American cities where middle class families have houses in the suburbs. More than half of the total population live in the Tokaido Megalopolis that include Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya. The city is too big for there to be any suburbs, and land tends to be pricey in any city, so the end result is that half of the national population live in apartments. Again, these buildings tend to have platform parking spaces, which means you'll be scraping your car just to get in and out of your house, too much of a hassle for most.

Now, some points that didn't apply to us but is a huge part of people avoiding Teslas:

1. Housing conditions. As mentioned above, half of the population live in apartments. Even if the building had a flat parking lot, you couldn't just install a charger as you please. Also, again most city buildings have platform parking (if any), so the only time you have access to your car is when you want to get it out. Makes it quite difficult to charge while parked, and logistically as well, it's far more complicated than just plugging it into a wall.
2. Most people don't drive daily. Actually, this is true for us as well, but most people don't commute by car because there's no parking space at work. Public transport is good enough for most, which is why they don't have cars to begin with. In fact, there are only 0.23 cars per capita in Tokyo (the entire prefecture, not just the city). Case in point: our next-door neighbors have a parking space, but no car. Let's face it, walking/biking is a way cheaper emissions-free mode of transportation than an EV, and it's only a five minute walk to the nearest subway station. Basically the cost is hard to justify for a lot of people.
3. The people that do drive daily live in the countryside, even though Tesla infrastructure is focused on the cities. I do get Tesla's purpose here; it doesn't make sense to start installing superchargers in sparsely populated areas, even if a larger portion of the residents drive daily. However, if you consider the cities that dot the ""countryside""... out of the four main islands, the ""main"" one that has the megalopolis in it has most (\~30) of the chargers, the second most populated (has Fukuoka and Nagasaki) has three, the third most populated, Hokkaido (has Sapporo) has *ONE* (NOT in Sapporo), and the least populated has a whopping ***ZERO*** superchargers. Even on the main island, if you lived on the North West side (as opposed to the South East that has the Tokaido Megalopolis), that whole half of the island has a grand total of **one** supercharger. The mountain range that divides those two halves of the country don't help either.

The government is going all out with the funds to *aggressively* cut down on CO2 emissions (I mean we get approx. 17k USD in grants and tax incentives if we buy an EV now), so hopefully we'll see developments in the near future that enable EVs to run on smaller batteries, but for now it's unfortunately a very niche market.

Edit: Holy yikes I didn't expect this much traction! I'll reply to as many comments as I can. Thank you for your patience!

Edit 2: A lot of people (incidentally not the ones that live here) are talking about the consumers' ""loyalty"" to domestic brands or about the size of other imported cars. I don't think it's as much a matter of ""loyalty"" as it is availability, and bang for the buck. Just look at how iOS has taken over. 
Some Japanese people prefer German luxury cars because it signals wealth and social standing. Others like Italian performance cars because they're into fast and fancy cars. The vast majority want something that won't put them in debt that will save them fuel and corner city streets easily. That happens to be Japanese cars.
I saw much less non-German cars during my time in Germany than non-Japanese in Tokyo. What else can you expect, of course domestic companies understand the domestic market better and have an edge. What's strange is that this doesn't apply to the North American market, which has had three major companies for a century before Tesla. Anyway, no one I know favors a car that doesn't suits their needs over one that does simply because it's ""Japanese"". One factor may be that parts for foreign cars are pricier and harder to come by if they break, but other than that, maybe if they worked for a company they would favor their cars.
Reliability is also a huge factor because there are state mandated biennial full inspections for all registered vehicles. It'll cost you around 500-1k USD and you won't be able to use your car for a few days, so you really want a car that a) won't break and b) has readily available spare parts if they break. I don't know about inspection laws in other countries.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/pmxsql/why_tesla_is_struggling_in_japan/,Screw_Hegemony,2076.0,0.9939

A friend of mine and her two kids drop by to see the Model 3. The kids are amazed that they get to see a Tesla up close. Show them all the details of the car (as many as I could) and they love that its 'electric....no gas needed mommy'.  They crawl in and out of the car, asking all sorts of questions.  Wanting to know all about the car, and in some cases knowing the answers to their own questions.

They pulled up in a new Audi A4 . A car that I would have LOVED to have had only a few short years ago.  Hell, those cars are what we all wanted.   German engineering.  Did it get any better?  Nope.

I asked them if they could have any car, BMW, their Audi, Mercedes ....what would they want.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,awn9rf,"We are all Tesla customers/fans, please stop attacking our fellow community members.","Yes, I'm referring to the split opinions on the recent Tesla price drop.

It was a larger price drop than usual (with some markets seeing up to 20-30% drop overnight), even by Tesla standards. Followed by two price drops earlier this year already, which is also more frequent than usual, even by Tesla standards. So it's very *understandable* how some people feel disappointed in their purchasing decision. I would feel slightly bummed out buying an iPhone if the exact same model sees a 20% price drop the week after, let alone an expensive car.

No, most people are not blaming Tesla (although now their ""Buy a Model 3 NOW to get the best deal"" emails from last quarter didn't seem to age that well), and I haven't seen many who have demanded any financial compensations or refunds, and let's be honest, they'd have no right to such claims.

But it should be *absolutely understandable* that many people feel somewhat bummed out, and attacking anyone who voices their feelings or just want to vent a little is just poor taste, and especially so when it's backed up by comments like ""You should be happy that you supported the mission!"", or ""How stupid of you to think cars won't depreciate!!!"".  Does venting help? Not necessarily, but you can't blame people from being... human.

If you don't feel disappointed or bothered in any way, shape, or form, then all the power to you. But not everyone is in the same financial situation that can handwave away thousands of dollars of differences. When people on this sub post ""I've never owned an expensive car, but I worked hard and saved hard to buy a Model 3"",  they get all the supports and upvote. But now the people who are very understandably be disappointed with the purchasing timing is getting attacked by the same people who enthusiastically encouraged them in the first place.

I'm not hoping for the community to reach a consensus on this topic, that would be as unrealistic as Farady Future's product line. But I am hoping that we can be **empathetic** toward each other so we can all move on and wish for Tesla's success in the long term.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,v3dgsv,My thoughts and analysis after using the CCS adapter for a few days,"Received my official CCS adapter from harum.io the other day and have been trying it out. So far I‚Äôm beyond happy and very glad I bought it. Here is some of my thoughts and analysis on it.

-It cost me 309 bucks exactly. Ordered on the 15th and received 15 days later. 

-The adapter worked with every station I‚Äôve tried so far. Tried at a few cheap/free 50kw CSS stations and would sit around 45-49kw charge rate. Was able to get 46kw(about 60% charge, 20% to 79%) delivered to my car at for $2.50 thanks to MG&Es special charge program in Madison, WI. That is DIRT CHEAP, about 5 cents per kWh. 

-I also tried an Electrify America 350kw signet unit and peaked out at 185kw and it stayed pegged at that from 14% to 33ish%. Charged to 84% and it costed me $7.27(13.9 cents per kWh) Way cheaper than the cheapest off peak rates near me which are about 11.8 cents per kWh, standard kWh rates are 14.8cents per kWh here. 

-There is NO way currently for you to precondition the battery for fast charging at non superchargers. You will be coldgated and won‚Äôt get good speeds at all until the battery is warmed up. The two work arounds for this are to either put a nearby supercharger into your navigation, or I also found that after driving for an hour or two on the highway going 80-85mph in 90 degree weather made it so the battery was warm enough for a full charge rate from an EA 350kw station. 

-350kw EA stations are definitely faster than V2 SuC and within two or so minutes of V3 charging times. Normally on a road trip I‚Äôll arrive with 0-5% left in the pack, charge for 10-15mins until the charge rate starts to drop below 120-100kw, leave with 50-65% and then rip it for 2-3 hours until the next charger. V3 can get me from 5% to 50% in 10-11 minutes. 350kw ea station got me from 14% to 50% in 12 minutes, and V2 SuC does that in about 20 minutes.

-I don‚Äôt have a place to charge my car at my apartment currently until I move in to my new place in August. This means I‚Äôm very reliant on public L2 charging and DCFC for my MYP. It‚Äôs really not that much of a hassle for me to charge my car, no more so than a gas car even without being able to charge at home. I either leave my car parked at a nearby L2 charger and let it go for a few hours, or if I need my car more immediately I‚Äôll go DCFC. If I‚Äôm DCFCing, all I‚Äôm doing anyways is sitting and watching a video for a few minutes, going to the bathroom and grabbing a snack, quick grabbing groceries, or eating a meal. There are still issues with having to do this. One is the obvious lack of convenience of having your car charge whenever you‚Äôre not using it, and waking up to a charged pack every day. This will eventually be a non issue for me once I move as my new place will have a charger. As time goes on this will be come a non issue for most apartment dwellers since way more L2 charging will be installed in the coming years. 

-The second issue I have with no at home charging is cost. Superchargers generally are half as expensive as gas, but they‚Äôre still way more expensive than charging at home(~31 cents per kWh where I am) Half of the reason I bought the CCS adapter was to help me save money in the long run. I drive over 35k miles a year so fuel costs are big for me, and a large reason it made sense for me to get an EV. The more I‚Äôm able to save the better, so being able to have the ability to charge at 3x-6x cheaper(5 to 14 cents) than a supercharger is a no brainer. 

-This CCS adapter will be my main form of charging until I move most likely. If I were still driving my 2014 CX-5 I would be paying nearly 600 bucks(and climbing) per month on gas. Now thanks to the CCS adapter I should be able to keep charging costs well under 100 bucks if I want to, and have access to every DCFC I could need. That 500 buck per month savings means my Tesla payment + fuel + insurance is cheaper than my 8 year gas cars payment, fuel and insurance; not to mention maintenance costs. Just simply amazing stuff.

I would highly recommend this to anyone thinking about it. It works and it works well. I don‚Äôt see tesla pricing this very much cheaper when it comes out than the $309 from buying direct from harum.io(Im expecting it to be more expensive than that honestly), so there‚Äôs no point in waiting to get your hands on one if you‚Äôve been eyeing it. It‚Äôs definitely a game changer for me, but I‚Äôm in a unique situation. Some/majority of people that charge from home almost exclusively and only need to DCFC a few times a year to see family won‚Äôt benefit as much as the supercharger network probably serves you great already.

TDLR: Works well, charges fast, saves money, more flexibility with charging, buy it if you want it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/v3dgsv/my_thoughts_and_analysis_after_using_the_ccs/,petitepenisperson,4887.0,0.9956

Well I'm a res holder in my mid 20s. I've spent some time breaking down the time benefits and quality-of-life benefits of the options. If you're stretching your budget to buy this car, maybe I can help. This thread isn't about whether you should buy a Model 3, I assume you've made up your mind already, and it‚Äôs not really about diving into delivery windows or possible tax credits. 


**Range:**

Tesla claims the small battery gets 220 miles of range and the big battery is 310. Let's assume you'll get 90% of this after some degradation, so about 200 miles and 280 miles. That's 80-ish more miles for $9000. 

The argument in my own head was ‚Äúyeah, 200 miles is fine for my commute and going 40 minutes to IKEA, but what about that romantic electric road trip I want to make?‚Äù

I live in the Seattle area, so looking at what kind of road trips I would do that are over 100 miles. Regardless of battery sizes, on road trips it is usually most efficient to charge at each supercharger you encounter to take advantage of the fast charge from 10% to ~70%. Distance between superchargers is usually between 80 miles and 160 miles. When I was mapping out trips I noticed the time savings were only about 12% for the longer ones, so I decided to make a chart of all the cities and places I might want to road trip to mapped on abetterrouteplanner, and then a few extra to fill out the data. 

[Check Out The Chart Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JxhLRVejjRtJPdZxlOocf-KLOEq_f0oLe5mDXsVqQT8/edit?usp=sharing)

It illustrates how time savings as % of total trip length is zilch on the 144 mile drive to Vancouver, it jumps to 5% on the no-charge drive to Portland because abetterrouteplanner recommends slower speed for the 173 mile drive, and then jumps to between 10 and 12 percent for any length of journey that has 2 charges or more. 

SF and LA are less efficient driving SR because the Supercharger network between Seattle and California has some holes, but I expect those to be filled in the next 12 months, bringing efficiency back in line with the curve. 

I was shocked at how drastic the returns diminish by adding 70% more battery. If you‚Äôre like me, you will find that paying $9000 results in only a minor ~12% bump in total time savings for long trips and doesn‚Äôt let you skip enough chargers to justify the cost. My conclusion: sleep easy, the SR battery is fine. 

**Premium Package:**

Obviously, nobody is immune to hype. Especially in the car world, it‚Äôs easy to get swept up in the excitement over cool features, and Tesla gets to piggyback on years of carmakers investing in convincing people options are worth paying for. 

Once we cool off, we can see how much we actually care about the premium options:

* Premium heated seating and cabin materials throughout, including open pore wood d√©cor and two rear USBs
* 12-way, power adjustable front seats, steering column and side mirrors, with custom driver profiles
* Premium audio system with more power, tweeters, surround speakers and subwoofer
* Tinted glass roof with ultraviolet and infrared protection
* Auto dimming, power folding, heated side mirrors
* LED fog lamps
* Center console with covered storage and docking for two smartphones

So, wood and premium materials are cool. Power seats are cool. Glass roof is cool‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs all pretty cool. And it almost sounds like a good deal when you see it all for *only* $5000. 

Ask yourself this though, is your office chair power adjustable? Do you care? How many speakers are in your home audio system? Mine has two and it sounds pretty good to me. The big rear windshield is standard, the glass roof is just a bit directly above the driver‚Äôs head. How much would you care about that? Fog lamps and cool side mirror tricks are fancy, but you will be just fine without them and stop caring either way pretty quickly. I admit I am tempted by the wood interior, but not $5000 tempted. It‚Äôs important to take a step back and see if you would pay this kind of money for these things anywhere else in your life. I haven‚Äôt before, so why start now? It already has a ton of cool features in the standard model to get excited about. 

My conclusion: It‚Äôs cool, but I don‚Äôt spend money on ridiculous luxury in my life. Is this worth the extra financial baggage? Nah. 

**Color:**
Similarly, it‚Äôs tempting to discount black as the color you *don‚Äôt* want because it's the boring basic color. I strongly suggest you consider black as equal to the other options, then get whatever color you want.

**Wheels:**
On the Model S, I‚Äôve heard that Aero wheels can get between 3% and 6% efficiency gains. Let‚Äôs call it 5%. If this is true, then you really want to pay $1500 for a 5% less efficient car? You kidding me with this? This is another luxury that is worse than useless, and I strongly suggest you don‚Äôt get caught up in the pearl-clutching about the exact wheel style people are salivating over. 


**FSD/Autopilot:**
I was tempted to not include this because it‚Äôs such a different animal of a discussion. Not only is Autopilot genuinely useful, but you can also buy it after you get the car. Now I do understand that it is definitely easier to finance that $5k along with the rest of the car, but $3k isn‚Äôt so bad, I would hang onto that until we actually get some delivery dates on FSD. 


Hope some of this helped, feel free to correct my math or call me a peasant for advising against options. I hope some young people who are looking at the car don‚Äôt get swept up in the luxury hype.

The delivery leader or whatever she was called seemed out of the loop, which didnt really bother me (she didnt know when my car was being delivered, as it seems happens a lot as logistics are wrong.)  Thankfully there was nothing I found defective.  

1 month in and around 1k miles, the front tire has a bubble.  I scheduled and went in for the appointment where it was fixed.  I was then told I owed them 500$.  These wheels cost 5.5k$ and are brand new, I noted this should be warranty covered.  They stated since this is obvious road hazard damage, it is not warrantied.  The warranty for this tire expressly states the tire is covered INCLUDING road hazards.  The service manager was ""on vacation"" and no one else in authority knew what to do, so he would call me back in 3 days when he returned.  (I still have not had a returned phone call.)  I left refusing to pay, but they charged my credit card (on file) any way!  Because I didnt sign anything, it was easy to dispute, but what a joke!

Tesla stories are no joke.  The customer service reps just direct you to stores and the store folks have limited or no information or authority to act.  I love the car but hesitate to encourage people to buy.  I think I have also learned to warn, if the car is damaged on delivery, refuse delivery.  Their promise to fix it may lead you to trouble as they cannot maintain repairs or loaners currently.  Then you see stories where the repair list mysteriously disappears and people have to fight for repairs on a brand new car.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,b3f8dt,Why Tesla stock isn‚Äôt over $900 (yet),"Okay just saw a post about how Tesla should be $937 if it traded at same sales valuation as a few years ago. Also noted that there are a LOT of people who are confused by Tesla falling despite incredible growth. 

I‚Äôm a shareholder, not a shortseller. This is just a reality post. Tesla falling despite growth is simply due to valuation first, other things second. 

A lot of people compare Tesla to Ford or GM. Forget those crap. Compare Tesla to Honda because Honda consistently produces cars that hold strong reputations. I would use Toyota but that stock is 4x the value of these two. The Civic, CRV, Accord, etc are all pretty stable products and most agree that future models will be just fine.

Anyway, Honda and Tesla have similar valuation. 

Tesla has $3B in cash, Honda has $18B in cash. Tesla last quarter revenue was $7.2B, Honda revenue was $35B. Tesla profit was $140M, Honda profit was $5.3B. Okay think about that. Honda‚Äôs profit was close to Tesla‚Äôs revenue. It was 25X Tesla‚Äôs and Tesla says it won‚Äôt make a profit this quarter. 

So, imagine you have a lemonade stand. Stand A costs you $100 and makes you $14 per year. Stand B costs you $100 and makes you $2 per year. What stand do you want to own? Stand A is also reliable while B takes big risks. 

So even if Tesla manages to grow revenues 5X its value from what typical automakers are valued would be the same as Tesla. 

When Tesla was trading at almost $400 a share more than a year ago it was because Elon Musk promised 10k cars per week by the end of 2018 from a factory operated almost completely by machines. (Cheap to operate) That didn‚Äôt work and Tesla uses people 24/7 and makes just 7k per week today. Tesla is beating expectations but the expectations have been pulled back drastically. 

It‚Äôs a tough business. During the Model Y event Elon spent more time talking about how tough the business is than the new car. 

Now you have this whole SEC thing, 4 layoffs in one year, demand speculation, high margin S cannibalization by 3, and other things. Basically you have the risk of lemonade stand that might start costing you money. So people think (what people think is what‚Äôs important because the market is a voting machine): why take on all the risk of buying a $100 stand that could cost me more money when I can simply own a stand that makes $14/year? 

That‚Äôs just the why. Doesn‚Äôt mean I agree with it. I own Tesla stock for a few reasons. 

1. EVs are the future
2. Tesla direct to consumer model can‚Äôt be replicated by other carmakers in the US
3. Tesla is far ahead of the competition. Model Y is much cheaper and far more range than competing crossover EVs (except Hyundai Kona if you think that‚Äôs comparable)
4. Tesla has more autopilot miles than any other company has to help with full autonomy and once Tesla cracks the software every Tesla sold since October 2016 will be a chip swap and flip switch away from driving itself. 

I strongly believe in those among other things and it‚Äôs a totally long term mindset. If the stock falls I‚Äôll buy more. If it rises I‚Äôll still buy more. When is a good time to buy? All the time. Here and there. The worst time and the best time. If you bought stocks before the 08/09 crisis , during it,  and after it you‚Äôd be way up.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,9h1cfi,"After seeing the new Audi , the iPace and Mercedes EQC I think that the traditional auto brands have a big hill to climb with EV sales","Aside from the other discussions relating to tech and drivetrain and features vs price of Teslas etc., I truly think that there is another massive hill to climb by other car companies in selling their EV cars.  This is from a design standpoint.  Here is what i have noticed a lot in relation to the comments regarding the designs of the iPace, eTron and EQC.  They are nice but I feel that people may not like them because they look too much like their ICE counterparts but cost more (much more in some cases).  So the clients will opt for the ICE version if they really want a similar look.  (Think VW eGolf)

The problem is that if they made them too different, then they would look ""odd"" or not like the Mercedes/Audi that people are used to and not many people would buy them (think BMW i3). So how do you build a car that can look unique enough to demonstrate it's an EV while similar enough to the brand to keep a familiar look.  I don't think any of the 3 succeeded.

I could be wrong... but from what I have seen I expect weak overall sales of the 3 recently launched ""Tesla killers"" because of that alone.  Tesla is a brand that expresses identity and a way of life.  That is very hard to recreate by other car companies getting into the EV space.  I truly want them to succeed though as more competition will grow the market as a whole, but I am, skeptical.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9h1cfi/after_seeing_the_new_audi_the_ipace_and_mercedes/,PFC12,8929.0,-0.9048
TeslaMotors,would buy if,7pek5p,Model S vs Model 3,"9 March 2018: This list is not updated anymore. Check out the latest [here](https://model3ownersclub.com/threads/model-3-vs-model-s-%E2%99%9E.6192/).

**Model 3's Advantages:**

* The Model 3 LRD has more range than the Model S 100D. Check out the numbers [here](https://i.imgur.com/WEW8Cnp.gif).  

* The Model 3 is 25% more efficient than the Model S which means you will pay 25% less to charge at home. 

* The Model 3 LRD has 78.3 kWh usable battery capacity (source: [page 6 footer](https://www3.epa.gov/otaq/datafiles/CSI-HTSLV00.0L13.PDF)) vs 72.6 kWh in the Model S 75 ([source](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/1865416/)) and 77.5 kWh in the Model S 85 ([source](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/1865416/)). That means the Model S/X battery capacities are over advertised but the Model 3 capacity is under advertised. 

* The Model 3 battery degradation will be 25% slower than the Model S because it requires fewer charge cycles to achieve the same mileage. If you look at the graph [here](https://i.imgur.com/l2qwzyr.gif), you can see that the S and X are already pretty good but the 3 will be better. 

* The Model 3 uses the newer battery technology. The 2170 cells in the Model 3 have 18.5% higher energy density than the 18650 cells in the latest Model S based on EPA documents. S/X will probably switch to the 2170 cells in the future. That means if you buy an S/X it is likely that it will become the old technology soon. When the S/X switch to 2170 cells, this should increase the range, reduce weight and improve handling. See the calculation and data sources [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7pek5p/model_s_vs_model_3/dsgnm1k/). Also, listen to Elon [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOPE_lMxShw&feature=youtu.be&t=1524).

* The Model 3 has the newer motor technology. These motors are lighter and have better track performance and Autobahn performance. They reduce weight and improve handling. The permanent magnet motors don't go into limp mode as quickly as the current Model S/X AC induction motors. The Porsche Mission E has permanent magnet motors for better track performance. The Bolt and Model 3 have permanent magnet motors for high efficiency. Unlike common assumptions, these motors are not the less capable economy option. They are superior in every metric. For more info see page 15 [here](http://www.parkermotion.com/whitepages/Comparing_AC_and_PM_motors.pdf), and [this](http://www.coppermotor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Techno-Frontier-2013-MBurwell-ICA-EV-Traction-Motor-Comparison-v1.8-Eng1.pdf) and [this](https://www.slideshare.net/DesignWorldOnline/the-best-motor-for-hybrid-electric-vehicle-powertrains-33408764)) research. They were more expensive until recently but the prices have come down. Check out paragraph 10 that starts with ""Alternatively, in terms of ..."" [here](http://rockstone-research.com/index.php/en/research-reports/2072-Commerce-Resources-Well-Positioned-For-Robust-REE-Demand-Growth-Going-Forward). The Model S does not have permanent magnet motors because they were expensive and difficult to source at high volume until recently because of rare earth materials but Tesla has made a deal with a Chinese supplier ([source](http://www.indmin.com/Article/3602814/Tesla-signs-permanent-magnet-supply-deal.html)).

* The Model 3 has a driver-facing camera. This might enable facial recognition related features for driverless Autopilot or it might be used for monitoring the cabin against vandalism under the Tesla Network. There is a video about it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb25sZbsFtw).

* Better handling because of less weight. Model S 75 and the Model 3 SR have similar range and both are RWD. Therefore comparing these two makes sense. Model S 75 curb weight is 4469 lbs ([source](https://www.caranddriver.com/tesla/model-s/specs/2017/Model-S-Sedan/390568)). Model 3 SR curb weight is 3549 lbs ([source](https://www.tesla.com/presskit)). The difference is 920 lbs (417 kg). The Model S 100D and the Model 3 LRD are also comparable in range. Model S 100D's curb weight is 4736 lbs ([source](https://www.caranddriver.com/tesla/model-s/specs/2017/Model-S-Sedan/390570)). Model 3 LRD's curb weight is expected to be around 3895 lbs. The difference would be 841 lbs (381 kg). 

* The Model 3 center console has more storage space and charger docks for two smartphones (Source: See video [here](http://www.motortrend.com/news/video-exclusive-a-closer-look-at-the-tesla-model-3s-interior/))

* The Model 3 has door pockets, coat hooks, lighted vanity mirrors and adjustable front seat belt anchor points. The Model S does not. 

* The Model 3 has a folding rear seat armrest with cup holders. [Photo](https://i.imgur.com/TeinQ9c.jpg)

* The Model 3 infotainment computer has a liquid cooled and faster processor. Therefore the touchscreen is more responsive. Even the latest Model S doesn't have this yet. To prevent any confusion, both the Model 3 and the latest Model S have liquid cooled AP2.5 computers with dual graphics cars. The AP2.5 computers are the same but the media control unit processors are different. The Model S/X still use the Tegra 1 mobile processor from 2011. Quote: ""On one side, there‚Äôs the infotainment Electronic Control Unit (ECU) or MCU now powered by the Intel Gordon Peak BMP and Intel Apollo Lake system-on-chip instead of Nvidia‚Äôs Tegra chip in Model S and Model X."" [Source](https://electrek.co/2017/09/28/tesla-model-3-new-dual-computing-platform-autopilot-media/).

* The Model 3 insurance will cost less than the Model S.

* Price: The Model 3 costs a lot less than the Model S. Many people are comparing the wrong cars. The Model 3 LR is not comparable to the Model S 75D. These cars are comparable: [Model S 75, Model 3 SR], [Model S 75D, Model 3 SRD], [Model S 100D, Model 3 LRD]. The Model S 100D starts at $97,300 before options. The Model 3 LRD is expected to start at 35+9+4.5+2= $50,500 assuming $4,500 for dual motors and $2,000 for air suspension. EAP and PUP are not included in either price. The Model S 100D is 93% more expensive than the Model 3 LRD. 

* The Model 3 front armrest has storage space. Model S does not. Also, the front cup holders are better positioned in the Model 3. They are difficult to use in the Model S.

* The Model 3 will support up to 184 kW Supercharging when Tesla upgrades the Superchargers. The Model S can only support up to 120 kW. Even the latest Model S doesn't support 184 kW yet. More info [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/6swl45/tesla_called_me_regarding_my_model_3_reservation/drqqrq5/).

* The Model 3 production line is more automated. Listen [here](https://youtu.be/51UhA6jffis?t=651) to Elon confirming this. That means fewer parts are hand assembled compared to the Model S which means fewer manufacturing errors. See the video [here](https://youtu.be/L8IqX18WZPo?t=157) and thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7y92pa/model_3silver_vs_model_s_gap_panel/).

* The Model S is not more premium than the Model 3 because there is no difference between the Model S and Model 3 gross margins. Check out the second bullet point on top of the shareholder letter [here](http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/ABEA-4CW8X0/2707351374x0x952053/F302D22F-FC9B-41A3-9534-60D0032673CC/TSLA_Update_Letter_2017-2Q.pdf). Even though the Model S prices are high, Tesla doesn't have higher gross margins on the Model S because half of the car is hand-assembled but the Model 3 production line is a lot more automated. The Model S is expensive because Tesla uses 7 times the number of employees as other car makers to build the S/X ([source](http://www.autonews.com/article/20170611/OEM01/170619951/teslas-real-capacity-problem:-too-many-people)). 

* The Model 3 has 1.5"" more headroom in the front and 2.4"" more in the rear seats than the Model S. 
Model 3: Front= 40.3‚Äù, Rear = 37.7‚Äù([source](https://www.tesla.com/presskit)), Model S: Front= 38.8"", Rear= 35.3"" ([source](https://www.tesla.com/support/model-s-specifications))
* The Model 3 has practically the same legroom as the Model S:
Model 3 Leg room: 42.7‚Äù Front, 35.2‚Äù Rear ([source](https://www.tesla.com/presskit))
Model S Leg room: 42.7"" Front, 35.4"" Rear ([source](https://www.tesla.com/support/model-s-specifications))
* The Model 3 is only 1.2 inches (3 cm) narrower: 
Model 3 width: 76.1‚Äù with mirrors folded  ([source](https://www.tesla.com/presskit))
Model S width: 77.3‚Äù with mirrors folded ([source](https://www.tesla.com/support/model-s-specifications))

* Only the pano sunroof version of the Model S supports a roof rack. The all-glass version does not. However, all Model 3 roof versions (all glass or metal) are expected to support a roof rack. Check out [this](https://youtu.be/GQ0epCRIgmc?t=1041) and [this](https://youtu.be/_DT0vDMWsq4?t=219) video.

* The Model 3 air vents are digitally controlled. That means when FSD is enabled and a family member summons the car for a driverless ride, air vents will work the way the passenger wants. Each passenger won't have to adjust physical settings. 

* Model 3 steering wheel has scroll buttons that with extra functions. 

* Better audio quality with the Model 3 with PUP compared to the Model S with PUP has been reported by many people who have compared the two. Check out [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3mO8UWFmAk) video.

* The headlights are better. They distribute the light evenly and provide a clearer view. Check out the photos [here](https://imgur.com/a/jWZ0V#MMtq8YZ).


**Model S' advantages:**

* The Model S has more cargo capacity: 30 cubic feet instead of 15.
* The battery failure and drive unit warranty is different. You get 8 years or 120,000 miles (whichever comes first) with the Model 3 LR, compared to 8 years and unlimited miles for the Model S. The warranty extension for the Model 3 will probably increase the mileage from 120K to 240K. Details have not been released yet. Practically, this doesn't make much difference because the overall warranty on both cars is 4 years or 50,000. Therefore most Model S owners who keep the car longer than 4 years already buy the warranty extension. 
* Model S steering wheel is thicker, more comfortable and attractive.
* Model S has a heated steering wheel.
* Free unlimited Supercharging for the duration of your ownership if you buy a Model S until the end of January 2018. See details [here](https://www.tesla.com/support/referral-program) for the 31 Jan 2018 deadline. Free Supercharging does not stay with the owner or with the car anymore. Tesla changed this more than a year ago. See the details [here](https://www.tesla.com/blog/update-our-supercharging-program). 
* The Model S has optional third-row seats for kids. 
* Bioweapon Defense Mode.
* Better backup camera than the Model 3 which seems to have a fisheye view. See the video [here](https://youtu.be/_DT0vDMWsq4?t=3007).
* Availability: In most cases, you can take delivery of a new Model S sooner than a new Model 3. The only exception to this is existing Tesla owners who don't mind an RWD car.
* The frunk is larger.
* Model S has a power liftgate.
* Autopilot following distance can be set using the cruise control lever instead of the touchscreen. 
* Model S has less road noise. The reason is unclear. If this is related to what Elon mentioned [here](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/885626334503882752), the Model 3 could have the same thing. 

**Less clear differences:**

* There is no difference in road noise between the S and the 3. Details [here](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/2555938/).
* Horizontal 15"" screen in the Model 3 vs vertical 17"" screen in the Model S. It is unclear which one is better.
* Model S door handles extend but they also break down frequently and cost $850 each to replace out of warranty. 
* The Model S has a keyfob and smartphone app entry which requires a mobile signal. The Model 3 has touchless Bluetooth smartphone entry and a hotel keycard. It is unclear which option is better. 
* The Model S has aluminum body panels instead of steal. These are better against corrosion but they are expensive to repair. 
* The Model S has an instrument cluster but the Model 3 has better visibility because it doesn't have it.

---

* Somebody made this excellent video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjW0YVxSCAE) that talks about most of the differences above. 
* Check out the video [here](https://youtu.be/W-RNygAgChQ?t=781) about whether it makes sense to buy an S. 
* Tesla will most likely update the Model S in 2018. See my message [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7htx43/does_anyone_have_any_thoughts_on_what_an_eventual/dqtsg3y/) for details.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,reu9ss,First 24hrs with my Model Y Performance (spoiler: full motor failure),"**Backstory**

I've always been into cars, and I was looking to get a new vehicle as my winter/practical car. I'm keeping my S4 and 718 Cayman S as well, so this was going to be in addition to those 2. I've been in enough Audi/BMW/Mercs/Porsches and wanted something different. Smooth power, roomy interior, cool factor and quiet ride were my main considerations. I don't need the all out performance of something like an X3M or GLC63 since I've got other cars. I wanted this to be a stark contrast to my current 2 vehicles.

&nbsp;

Decided a MYP would be a good fit, especially with very strong resale value. I can keep it for a few years and see what the electric market is like with Rivian, electric Macan etc. The ordering and delivery process was terrible, but that's another story. It was easily the worst ""dealership"" experience I've had buying any car (new or used).

&nbsp;

Anyways, I get my car on the evening of Dec 10th. By the afternoon of the 11th, it had a rear motor failure followed by a completely dead vehicle that's unable to drive. 

&nbsp;

**Motor Failure** 

Picked up my blue on white MYP on the evening of Dec 10th. By the afternoon of the 11th, it had a [rear motor failure](https://imgur.com/FqTE42h) and 2 mins later was [completely undriveable](https://imgur.com/2NQjz3W) and had to be towed to the dealer. It was being driven at 60km/h when a warning came up about the rear motor. A couple mins later, it was fully dead. Luckily I was near a friends house and parked it in their driveway. Would have sucked if this happened on the highway. I googled the error and it seems like this has happened to other people before, and usually pretty soon after delivery. Still, off too a pretty terrible start with the car.

&nbsp;

Bad things I've noticed over the first 24hrs, coming from someone who's into cars and driven a bunch of stuff on street/track:

&nbsp;

**Build Quality:** Wasn't expecting much here, so I was ok with some gaps and not having perfect panels. There was some glue residue on the edges of the panoramic roof, and there were marks on the headliner when I took delivery. The interior plastic piece on the b pillar has a massive gap between it and the roof on 1 side. Otherwise, I'm totally ok with it. I knew what I was getting into and wasn't expecting it to be on the level of the germans.

&nbsp;

**Closing the Door:** You have to pull pretty hard to actually close the door. It wasn't just me either. Multiple people failed to close the door properly the first time they tried. You really have to slam it more than any other car I've owned. Not a very nice experience for the user. I can imagine some older person actually having trouble to close it properly.

&nbsp;

**Honk Upon Lock:** I can't believe this car makes a cheap honk sound when you lock it like some early 2000s GM car. It should 100% have some pleasant sounding chip/beep. 

&nbsp;

**Loud Seat Motors:** Loudest seat motors I've heard, especially the lumbar.

&nbsp;

**Cheap Carpet Mats:** I've already installed proper mats, but the stock carpet mats (only included for driver and passenger) are the thinnest and cheapest feeling carpet mats I've experienced. They're so lightweight and flimsy with no impression of quality. This doesn't matter too much, but it speaks to the cost cutting happening everywhere.

&nbsp;

**Can't View Songs on Phone?** Unless I'm dumb, is there actually no way to view a list of all music on my iPhone and pick something? The interface between phone and the car is terrible and super limited. I really hope I'm missing something here. There isn't even an easy way to activate Siri since the in-car voice button will trigger the Tesla voice assistant. Very disappointed in the user experience here.

&nbsp;

**Flimsy Sunshades:** Once again, more cost cutting. You can easily feel the cardboard inside them. There is absolutely no feeling of quality when operating them. There's also a little flap of fabric that covers the mirror instead of a sliding piece of plastic or plastic cover. Feels like something I'd expect in a $10k car.

&nbsp;

**Very Unrefined Suspension:** This is probably my biggest ""real"" complaint. It feels like shit. There is no sense of money or R&D put into it. It's so crashy when driving and you can literally hear creaks and noises from the suspension being transmitted into the vehicle while driving (with the music off). The dampening feels like crap and there's no reason for this car to ride this terribly. I bet you an A class has a more upscale feeling suspension. No adaptive dampening available is also a joke. I expected this based on some reviews, but it's next level bad. My Cayman S with Sport PASM feels light years ahead in suspension setup. Maybe if you're coming from a Civic or Camry this is acceptable to you, but if you've driven any modern car from a luxury brand, this is appalling. 

&nbsp;

**Headliner:** I'm probably just spoiled, but I thought most cars nowadays had a fabric headliner. Not the MYP. It looks like fabric, but when you touch it, it's a nasty cheap plastic type of material. Come on, I get you have to cut costs, but this is nearly $100k after tax in Canada. 

&nbsp;

**Auto Dimming Mirrors:** These work well enough, but the portion of the mirror that auto dims is small. There is a thick border around the auto-dim part of the mirror, where it's normal and reflective. I've never had another car where it stands out this much. You can almost be blinded by lights in this outer border since it's so chunky. It should definitely extend more towards the edges of the mirror.

&nbsp;

**HomeLink Garage Opener:** Just another example of more cost cutting. Even Porsche gives this to you. I'm sure it's Tesla being cheap and not wanting to pay the license fee to HomeLink for every car sold. I know they offer it as a dealer accessory for like $400, but come on.

&nbsp;

**Straight Line Speed:** It's actually not as fast as I expected. If you're not used to fast cars, this will feel like a space ship. If you're driven modern performance cars, it's nothing special. I feel like the MYP has an adequate amount of power. I feel like it needs another 100hp to be classified as a proper performance variant. My other cars both feel just as fast and launch significantly harder with launch control. The MYP rolls into the power softly from a dig. When you're rolling, it does feel great - but so does any other modern fast car if you're in the right gear.

&nbsp;

**Blind Spot Monitoring:** It's just sad that the car doesn't have true blind spot monitoring like every other modern car. I knew it didn't have it (the chime/assist thing is garbage vs a proper system) so I was prepared for this, but just 1 more thing it's missing.

&nbsp;

**Rear Visibility:** Terrible due to the slope of the rear glass. Worse than all its competitors. I'm ok with this but some people might not be.

&nbsp;

**Heated Steering Wheel:** It seems to cycle on/off to regulate the temperate. The problem is that it's either nice and toasty or very noticeably colder when it turns off. I wish it be consistent. It's a stark contrast and very noticeable as it turns on and off while attempting to maintain a warm wheel.

&nbsp;

**Auto High Beam:** Very inconsistent and basically unusable in my short night time testing. I live near some rural roads with a single lane in each direction and it wasn't very sure about when to turn the high beams on/off. I ended up turning it off after getting fed up with the system. 

&nbsp;

Good things about the car:

&nbsp;

**Smoothness:** I love how smooth it is with no transmission. This is exactly what I wanted. Both my other cars have a DCT and they get pretty clunky in the winter when cold. It's very nice not to feel any shifts. Smoothness also goes for power delivery. It's not as fast as I expected, but I love how smooth it feels when accelerating. 

&nbsp;

**Quietness:** I was on the fence about this before getting the car. I expected it to be very loud on the highway based on some things I've read. I was very happy with the cabin volume and found it to be much quieter than expected. Maybe I'm just used to louder performance cars and that's why I think this is quiet, but regardless, I think interior noise is totally acceptable for what the car is.

&nbsp;

**Interior Space:** This thing is massive inside. I love how much rear seat room you have, all the trunks and under floor storage you have. It feels so nice and airy while driving too. The way the windows are positioned and the drivers seat. I love how open it all feels. The white interior also helps out here.

&nbsp;

**Sound System:** I had read some major complaints so I was expecting the worst. It really isn't that bad. It's half decent. Don't go expecting 7 series or S class quality, but I think it's totally acceptable for this class of vehicle. Those complaints were way overblown to me. I'm using bluetooth streaming from my iPhone which I believe is the 2nd clearest source with USB being the best.

&nbsp;

Overall, I still think it's a decent car. I expected the cost cutting and knew about some of the downsides going into it, but it's always different once you actually own the car. For the reasons I wanted the car, it works well. The suspension is easily the biggest let down. If they give it air suspension, increase power and fix up their UX, I think they could have nearly perfect compact SUV. And offer some kind of luxury package for $5k to make the interior feel more expensive. Nicer headliner, nicer door cards, better carpeting, more sound deadening etc.

&nbsp;

Also, I love to complain and nitpick basically every car, so I'm definitely more critical than most people. Your average buyer coming from a Prius would love this thing inside and out. I realize I'm more spoiled by nicer cars and having spent significant time with luxury brands.

&nbsp;

Lmk if you guys have any questions! Happy to answer them.

&nbsp;

**Edit: replying to some basic questions. Will do more individual responses later on.**

Yes, I'm still happy with the purchase. I knew what I was getting into. I just wanted to share my experience as someone who owns my current 2 cars (2017 Cayman S and 2012 Audi S4 w/ tune).

&nbsp;

Straight line speed: I have dragy numbers for all 3 cars. With NO rollout:

718 Cayman S - 4.13 seconds

Audi S4 w/ tune - 4.32 seconds

Model Y Performance - 4.10 seconds

With rollout, all 3 cars are easily in the 3 second range. Numbers on paper don't always reflect what a car feels like in real life. I'm just saying that I expected the Y Performance to feel faster off the line vs combustion cars, but in reality it's nearly identical if you mash the throttle. Again, compared to the 2 cars I own. I'm not saying it's slow, but it's a speed I'm used to and find adequate. It doesn't feel like it's crazy fast. It IS very nice for passing power while cruising.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/reu9ss/first_24hrs_with_my_model_y_performance_spoiler/,FazedCow,12918.0,0.998

TeslaMotors,would buy if,as4bav,[Discussion] Why I think you should not prepay for FSD,"People have been asking me in HW3 threads on reddit and on TMC if they should prepay for FSD (to lock-in the current pricing) and separately if they should wait for the newer HW3-equipped cars instead of buying now.
So in order to make my answers more visible I am doing this, feel free to chime in with your perspective too.

So I'll start with a word of caution: Tesla's history of fulfilling retrofit promises is not exactly great (remember they'd rather you buy a new car - a lot more profit that way):

- (paid!) P90D->P100D battery upgrade took a lot longer than promised and was filled with frustration: https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/2556184/
- Lighted vanity mirrors - did not happen: https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/169977/
- AP1 development will continue despite HW2 arrival: did not happen
- ""Your car will meet you at the porch"" summon - did not happen, people that tried to pursue it (on ap1) were told ""if it's not in the manual, it was not promised""
- For new model 3 owners - also consider the wording in the purchase agreement (not sure if same in CN and EU): h/t https://twitter.com/scottwolf_arch/status/1066314684863795200

> [Prior agreements, oral statements, negotiations, communications or representations about the Vehicle sold under this Agreement are superseded by this Agreement. Terms relating to the purchase not expressly contained herein are not binding](https://www.tesla.com/order/download-order-agreement?country=US)
So don't just blindly trust what the tesla.com says, only trust what the purchase agreement lists! AP1 owners never got what they were promised.

Also since the ""promise"" was to only to retrofit a new computer - if you are on a HW2.0 car - you'd be with the old worse Bosch radar and RCCC cameras (= no dashcam), and no redundancy. Retrofitting new radar and ep. the e-fuses is very unlikely - major wiring harness change!

And god-forbid there's another sensor suite change meanwhile - that would mean even hw2.5 would be on subpar sensor suite with unknown performance. (I am not saying it's likely, but it is possible and it happened before very stealthily, remember the first [""hw2.5 is nothingburger"" statements from Tesla!](https://electrek.co/2017/08/09/tesla-autopilot-2-5-hardware-computer-autonomous-driving/) ) 

Also remember, when you pay cash at time of upgrade (even if price is somewhat more), you will likely get much higher priority vs when you already paid so there's no downside to place you last in line (see model3 reservations for example of how this played out).

And the there's not even a timeline when HW3 would actually make any meaningful difference in performance, after all current software is not even at the promised EAP level (and it's been 2+ years since EAP was finished and was only undergoing final testing and validation, if you believe original announcement. Meanwhile here in the real world we are on 3rd total rewrite of the codebase and cannot even read the speed signs yet)

Look at all the people that prepaid FSD back in 2016 - how well did it work for them? And as they say final 10% of work take 95% of time.

Also did you know first batch of hw2.5 was stealth-recalled due to overheating problems? Unlikely any retrofits would happen until HW stabilizes - who knows how long it takes, and the happy new owners of hw3 cars might be not so happy for quite a while initially (just look at hw2 owners).

Also consider crash risks - if you get into an accident, chances are the car would be totalled so whatever software-only upgrades you have would be lost (FSD is NOT transferrable between cars).

So you see, there are lots of risks and the upside is just fixing the price of a potential upgrade who knows when, if at all? (what if HW3 will not achieve FSD and HW4 would be needed in another few years? and HW3 is to only achieve full EAP promised stuff (like that smart summon)?) There's also a very real chance the price cannot be retroactively increased for existing owners because of how the current price is advertised.

With all of this in mind - I don't recommend you to prepay for FSD. Enjoy what you have now! When the time comes you can evaluate the options in a lot more informed way. Assuming you still have the car and like what you see and so on.

I should add that I prepaid for FSD in Jan 2017 and then regretted it. But because Tesla bought back my car as a lemon for the full price in December 2017, I had a rare chance of a do-over and I sure did nto make that mistake again when I bought another one in March 2018.

In a similar vein, if you REALLY want a Tesla car and can afford it NOW - buy it now and enjoy a known quantity. If you cannot afford it now or if you don't LIKE what's offered now, then wait until you can afford it or when something you like is offered and look at everything at that point in time. It's really hard to predict the future after all.

I know some people consider the prepayment money as a grant to Tesla to speed up the development - if you truly believe in something like this, there are still better ways that better protect you:
- You can invest in Tesla stock and if FSD happens - imagine the explosion in the stock price that would follow! And these money are transferrable to your next Tesla should there be a delay in development or something happened to your old car too!
- You can also invest the money in some other ways and be diversified (which apparently is very important too according to investment advisors)
- If you want it to be a free gift to Elon/Tesla - do it as a free gift instead - it allows them to have more cash without incurring the liability on the book so the benefit is again bigger

- In the end it's your money of course, but do choose wisely, I am sure you worked hard to earn them!

EDIT - addition from another comment below: since I checked what FSD actually affords you in mytesla page, I was a bit shocked. Here's the full description:

> Full Self-Driving Capability

> All you will need to do is get in and tell your car where to go and your Tesla will figure out the optimal route. Please note that Self-Driving functionality is dependent upon extensive software validation and regulatory approval which may vary widely by jurisdiction. BUY

So.. a glorified navigation no actual driving involved?

Since it‚Äôs just a metal box, you can easily run electrical connection to it.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,e3kgre,Update: Diminished Value claim for Model 3 accident,"This is a follow-up and conclusion to a few posts I've made since the summer. My Model 3 was hit/run in a parking lot. SentryMode caught the whole thing on video and eventually deciphered the license plate of the guy who hit/run run me - [post 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/cfpbed/it_happened_to_me_too_parking_lot_hitrun_caught/) and [post 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/cg3jil/update_it_happened_to_me_too_parking_lot_hitrun/). Once the insurance claims were filed and the other guy was officially listed as the at-fault driver, and the repairs were made and paid for (and reimbursed expenses to me), I pursued a Diminished Value claim. For this, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/cq8vle/to_all_model_3_owners_whove_been_in_an_accident/) asking for data about any redditors experiences in this area. There didn't seem to be much personal experience, but u/PaleInTexas suggested AutoLoss.com. .... so with that whole introduction out of the way, here's the updated.

I hired Auto Loss and at first worked with Monica. She was responsive and helpful. AutoLoss provided me with boilerplate documents in which my scenario's details were pasted in, and I was directed to submit them to the insurance adjuster. AutoLoss never visually inspected my car, but based on details and the repair invoice, they suggested that the DV was ~$4800 (P.S. 2018 Model 3 LR RWD, first prod; $2600 of body damage on rear door and quarter panel, no structure damage). When I submitted that number to State Farm, they wanted an 'independent' appraisal of their own, for which they arranged and paid. Based on that appraiser's report, SF offered me $1800.

Any time I received any communication from State Farm, I forwarded it to Auto Loss and either Monica or Jesse would respond. Not immediately but in a day or two. They asked me to take my car to CarMax for an appraisal to buy it. I told CarMax everything about the accident, but I didn't mention anything about the DV claim. They are probably wise to the process, and wouldn't appreciate knowing that I never had any intention of actually selling. But I needed a real offer to know how much value was lost in the car's worth. AutoLoss and State Farm's appraiser both agreed that my car (pre-accident) was worth somewhere around $47k-$48k. CarMax's offer to buy was $37k. Obviously, CarMax's offer has their desired profit margin built in, but this offer demonstrated that my car had lost much more than $1800 worth of value.

I counter-offered to StateFarm at $4500. Of course, the adjustor is a professional negotiator, trying to pay as little as possible. So the conversations included lots of reason why he can't/won't pay that. He also told me that State Farm was very familiar with AutoLoss and was often unrealistically high in their valuations in their experience. He also told me that some of the claims had gone all the way to court and the car owner was stood up by AL because they didn't show. After all these reasons, State Farm offered me $2300.

It was clear to me and the adjuster that the claim wasn't going to be settled for $2300 and it wasn't going to be settled for $4500. I don't know how often these DV claims actually go to court, but I was starting to feel confident because the $10k difference between what **their appraiser** said was the pre-accident value, and the real/valid offer to buy from CarMax, told me that the number was closer to my position to theirs.

I explained all of this to the adjuster. I told him that I imagine that he has a large case load, that his boss wouldn't like to see this claim go unsettled, and that he was spending a lot of valuable time with me that could all go away - to settle for the middle at $3300. I told him he has 48 hours to get back to me.

At the 49th hour after not hearing anything from him, I sent the adjuster an email telling him the price just went up to $4100. An hour later, I got a phone call offering me $3000 and I agreed.

So I'm posting all of this for two reasons. First, to put some data out there about Diminished Value data for others to benefit from if anyone ends up in a similar situation. Second, to try to shed some light on the whole process of dealing with insurance company for a DV claim.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,aq6s1f,S100D owner here - first impressions after an Audi E-Tron test drive,"I have been invited by Audi to test drive the E-Tron yesterday in Switzerland and wanted to share my impressions. 

Overall what surprised me the most is how much Audi wants the driver feel that it is driving an ICE car and not an electric car. The regenerative braking is very weak unless you hit the brake pedal (which the Audi sales guy said is the most natural way to tell the car to slow down). 

From the outside and in the inside everything feels like another Audi.

With regards to regenerative braking it appears that the angle at which the car goes is taken into account: on a flat road there is almost no braking, when going downhill the regenerative braking kicks and slows the car down just like an ICE engine would do. 

The car‚Äôs battery was showing 320km range on a 95% charge. Unlike a Tesla, the full power is only available when you move the gearbox into Sport mode. 

I told the sales guy that for me to buy this car Audi would need to add a setting to turn the car into ‚Äúone-pedal driving‚Äù (or Tesla mode :) ).  I can understand where Audi is going and why they want their car to behave like an ICE car but this is not going to attract electric car owners in my opinion. Note that since Audi is going the route of online software upgrades it is possible that this will be improved over time. 

A plus point for Audi though: the noise insulation is much better than in a Tesla. Not sure if this has to do with the huge frames they have around the doors‚Äô windows but it feels very quiet.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,bya6u4,"Here are thoughts on the first 250 miles of owning my M3 Performance. They are honest, pensive, and varied. In a word, WOW.","People tend to rationalize decisions and have instant bias toward the choices they‚Äôve made.  This often leads to confirmation bias in there analysis.  I‚Äôve trained myself as best I can to avoid these types of biases, and so I‚Äôm going to give you my honest evaluation of my M3P after spending day 1 driving it and visiting a supercharger for the first time 

Background.  I live 25 miles out of a geographically large metro area (Dallas/Fort Worth). I‚Äôm 39 miles from the nearest supercharger.  I have a wall charger at home on a 60 amp circuit.   I‚Äôm a married father of 2 (family of 4) -preteen and teen.   Commutes are long, road trips are frequent, I‚Äôm financially conservative, but always looking for adventure.  

Here we go.  My thoughts and impressions:

1) Everyone should own a Tesla.  Period.   Anything ‚Äòbad‚Äô you have heard is nit picking.  The overall experience far exceeds any small issues.   This bullet point sums it up if you want to stop reading and go buy one. 
2) Traffic is now enjoyable.   The car does all the hard work.  If everyone owned one of these, traffic would flow incredibly better.   I‚Äôve always wondered why the Tesla‚Äôs I‚Äôve seen on the road weren‚Äôt blowing by people, and it‚Äôs because the driving experience is now chill. No rush, sit back, let your mind wonder, enjoy the music, talk on the phone, listen to a podcast, think something interesting.   
3) Traffic is especially fun with family.  You can participate in all the conversations and be briefly distracted, even in heavy traffic, and it‚Äôs no stress.  This is coming from someone who doesn‚Äôt fully trust the AP yet, but man it does an outstanding job and is a life changer.  
4) It feels amazing to not be spewing fumes, and riding in an oily, smelly, polluting vehicle. And I‚Äôm an NRA member, hunter, non-liberal type who also owns an F-250 diesel truck for hauling cattle. If everyone owned one of these our cities would be amazingly cleaner places.
5) Holy cow my car is fast.  Cheers Love, the Calvary‚Äôs here. If you want to be up there, press the pedal and you are up there instantly.   No turbo wind up time, no noise, you are just there.  0-60 is great but 60 to 100 is even greater.  Yes 100. And it feels so controllable at 100 you don‚Äôt even realize it (come on, I had to test it)
6) The car is absolutely beautiful.  The paint, the lines, the white interior, and view of the sky, the minimalistic controls.   The view of the interior from the outside!
7) The charge rate at home is better than I expected.  44-45 miles per hour at about 60 pct battery charge.   I had done the math, but when you consider that you can run a bunch of errands and then in about one hour you have a full tank of ‚Äògas‚Äô again. So cool.  
8) the superchargers are amazingly simple and the automation is great. Notifications, information on screen, automatic payments, no buttons to push at a pump, wow. A truly refined experience.   And the AC is on the whole time. 
9) the audio system. Wow. 
10)  the handling. Wow. 
11) the experience on the inside is underrated! I have no wind noise. Road noise of course, but no wind.  And the lack of engine noise and vibration is so nice.  And the go-pedal response is instant.  And did I mention that it‚Äôs quick?!

The negative: 
1) The shiny black center console needs to be improved.  Going to add a wrap. It shows dust and fingerprints way to easily.   
2) The buying experience needs to be improved considerably.  It‚Äôs a black hole for too many people. And when you NEED a car, you can‚Äôt be wondering when you might get it.  
3). There are a few small issues: view out the back is not good (the rear camera is excellent though),  I want to be able to open the front trunk without using my phone, and the navigation needs the ability to input a starting location and state of charge instead of just using your current location and state of charge so you can plan ahead.    And I wish the navigation results would automatically show you if you‚Äôll be able to make it to the closest supercharger after your destination.   But man these are such small things compared to the overall experience. 

Have I missed anything?    

The car is a leap forward and will change how we go about moving around.   I remember the 70s when cars were unreliable and most without A/C.   This car makes normal driving feel that antiquated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/bya6u4/here_are_thoughts_on_the_first_250_miles_of/,FlyinBovine,1568.0,0.999
TeslaMotors,would buy if,hkuivm,"PSA: Check your Carfax, even AFTER sale of your CPO vehicle","I am normally a huge proponent for Tesla. I was happy to recommend buying CPO from them but am actually in quite a pickle that I have to say now ""buyer beware."" I bought a Model X certified pre-owned (CPO) from Tesla (at Paramus NJ) without one issue on the Carfax report. It turns out that after I received a clear title from the DMV a month after the sale, there was an anomalous report of flood damage recorded to the DMV on the vehicle approximately 3 weeks after the issuance of my clean title, and I was not aware of it until recently. 

Because of this report, supercharging was turned off. You can imagine my surprise learning this over a hundred miles from home. I was never sent a courtesy call, nor email, nor letter telling me they had this report on my VIN. No attempt was made to their paying customer to rectify it. I would not have driven it that far had I known and would have taken another vehicle. They effectively kept me stranded and did not even turn on supercharging even temporarily for me to get home. I called roadside service twice out of desperation and the CSR had to tell me no exceptions because of policy--I could tell they said so reluctantly, but they know they stranded a family of five. They just turned it off without telling me, knowing full well I showed active use of the vehicle on my app and driving it nearly weekly since the day of sale. I was never in a flood or accident. I never went to a shop other than Tesla for anything more than minor repairs or tire change, and my insurance is up to date without any claims. 

I wish I could tell you a happy ending to this. Currently I am actually sitting in a hotel, waiting on the trickle charge of 4 miles an hour, to get enough miles to get home. The hotel was nice enough to let me charge. I had a starting charge of 60 miles and need 140 miles to get home safely. You do the math to figure out how long we've been here.

I really am at a loss as to how to prevent this even after sale from Tesla, but aside from periodically screening Carfax, a brand on the title is a scarlet letter that will take serious effort to remedy. I know my experience is a really rare event among the thousands of vehicles they sell, but when it happens to a vehicle that you paid significant up front price to get, it can hit you hard if you cannot weather it. And it's an even harder hit when the company you trusted treats you now like a pariah.


EDIT: Thank you all for the advice and wishing us good luck! Just wanted you to know I made it home with the family safe and sound.

Why does tesla not want to reduce the cost substantially so that almost all owners buy into it? Or roll it into the cost of every car sold and have it as a default feature?

TeslaMotors,would buy if,j88ffd,Feels like Tesla lacks several drivers assistance features other brands have had for years,"First of all, I love my Model 3 and would never buy another ICE car after owning it. But every time I am driving in friends vehicles, I am jealous of the inclusion of obvious safety features Tesla completely refuses to add. For such a technically advanced vehicle, it shocks me that there is no option for the following features:

\- REAL blind spot assist. My favorite implementation of this is Mercedes/Maserati with a bright red triangle in the mirror when a car is in your blind spot. Toyota and others with the orange icon are also solid. Tesla used to have an option for this to display on screen, but it was silently removed because it was implemented so poorly. Nobody wants to look at a screen while lane changing, put the indicator on the mirror where we're already looking. I know proper hardware for this (nor the mirror LED) don't exist so this can't really be added OTA.

\- Rear cross traffic alert. Warns when cars are driving perpendicular behind you when backing up. Again, no rear radars so it couldn't easily be added OTA.

\- 360 camera(!). Teslas have so many cameras it feels like this would be a no brainer. I realize there are licensing requirements for this, but come on. If Hundai can add it on their mid $20k vehicles, Tesla has no excuse.

Does anyone else feel annoyed by this? I know people have been driving for decades just fine without this safety tech, but it's a shame that not even the most expensive Teslas have ANY of these features. It bums me out to see how much development time Tesla uses to add new games but doesn't address any of these basic drivers assistance features that have existed for well over a decade.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/j88ffd/feels_like_tesla_lacks_several_drivers_assistance/,IBTRDIA,521.0,-0.7071

I've been working on this design in my spare time over the past 10 months or so. This prototype is 3D-printed and spray-painted, but if there's enough interest I'm hoping I can get them injection molded and turn it into a product.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thanks everyone for the constructive feedback! Now that I've got some impressions, I'll answer to some common sentiments:

1. **These look too thick/chunky!** \-- I don't disagree. I was initially going for something much more akin to the 19"" sport wheels, but turns out that something that thin won't physically fit over the 18"" wheels. I also need a bit of room for the clips that latch onto the wheels. I miiight be able to thin out the spokes a bit, but likely not by much without making the whole design look real stupid.
2. **How do the aerodynamics compare?**  \-- This design was intended for looks and not for range. The target customer would be someone who wants a more traditional wheel look than the aero caps and doesn't really like the look/color of the wheels underneath, but also doesn't want to spend a lot of money on new wheels and/or wants the ability to switch to aeros for range sake at will. (Basically I designed these for myself, surprise surprise). So I haven't done any practical testing of the range effects (also I didn't make enough prototypes to cover all four wheels at once!), but I'd expect them to be less efficient than the aero caps but more efficient than Tesla's 19"" wheels (mostly based on wheel diameter).
3. **I want these in black or some other color.** \-- If this does become a product I plan on offering silver (with black center, as pictured), or all black as options. Maybe more if I expect another option to do well.
4. **The finish looks rough/weird in the pictures.** \-- Agreed, the plastic comes out rough due to the method of 3D printing, and I was too lazy/eager/impatient to sand and buff the prototype. As a product (industrially injection-molded) the finish will definitely be smooth/glossy/shiny. (Matte paint could be applied if demand for that option were high enough)
5. **I like the idea, but the execution is not for me.** \-- Totally fair. If this particular design goes well I'd certainly be interested in making other designs, such as a true ""aero"" alternative or aero covers for other tesla wheels.

&#x200B;

Thanks again for the feedback. I've got a bit more testing and validation to do (as well as seeing if I can do anything at all to thin out the spokes), but I think I'm gonna go for it! Probably will need to launch a Kickstarter or the like to pay for the initial tooling.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,gzp3zh,"I finally test drove the Model Y, and I left loving our Model 3 even more...","I really wanted to like the Model Y, but it‚Äôs not the crossover my wife and I were hoping for.  If we got a second Tesla right now, it would likely still be a Model Y just for the cargo room, but I think we‚Äôd still fight over who got the Model 3.  I definitely don‚Äôt think the Model Y is ‚Äúthe best Tesla ever made‚Äù as so many reviewers have stated.  I do think it will fit *some* people better than the Model 3, but I think the Model 3 is a better sedan than the Model Y is a crossover.

1.  The hatch is too low for our dog to comfortably ride in the back, which is priority #1 in getting something other than a sedan for our family.  This was the biggest disappointment for us.  Yes, he could lie down.  Yes, he could technically stand up if he were close to the back of the rear seats.  No, this isn‚Äôt going to be an acceptable way to travel with our dog.

2.  Even the Performance Model Y with the Performance Upgrade Package didn‚Äôt feel as sporty as our non-P Dual Motor Model 3.  This is expected as a heavier, taller vehicle is going to be harder to turn and roll more when you do.  Even though this wasn‚Äôt surprising, it is still a trade off that favors the Model 3.

3.  Visibility through the rear view mirror is way worse than I had imagined.  You really have to experience it to understand how bad, I think.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what the rear camera is for,‚Äù you might say.  Well, I like using my rear view mirror for more than backing up, but the UX doesn‚Äôt allow the rear camera and navigation open at the same time.  I think it will soon, though, as it is the only way to quickly see what vehicles are behind you and overtaking you with one quick glance instead of three (each side mirror and the rear view mirror).

4.  I watched quite a few Model Y reviews with hundreds of thousands of views, and not one made any mention of the rear crossbeam being an issue for headroom, let alone rear passenger safety.  I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô8‚Äù, and my head solidly hit that crossbeam unless the seat was straight up.  It‚Äôs not just a comfort issue, but it could be a big safety issue.  I wish independent crash tests included rear end collisions with dummies in all seating positions, but typically, seats are tested on sleds outside of the vehicle.  That will do nothing to see how a rear passenger would fare in a rear end collision with the seat reclined.  This really concerns me as the father of a teen whose hormones drown out the part of the brain where her common sense resides (just like all of her friends).  Scrub to 10:27 at this video to see what I‚Äôm talking about: https://youtu.be/-V1YNsUGQI0

TL;DR  If you‚Äôre considering a Model Y, drive one and sit in the back with the seats at all positions to know what you‚Äôre getting and what you‚Äôre giving up over getting a Model 3 instead.  The Model 3 is still the coolest thing of any kind I‚Äôve ever bought, and I think a lot of people who *think* they want a Model Y will end up being happier with a Model 3.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/gzp3zh/i_finally_test_drove_the_model_y_and_i_left/,TWANGnBANG,112548.0,0.9936
TeslaMotors,would buy if,d0emwa,Model S to the Nurburgring. Post for the layman.,"I wrote this so that friends who don't mainline Tesla can share in the excitement too.  --------------------------

Porsche has finally released the Taycan with elaborate and expensive fanfare.¬† The starting price is much higher than anticipated - a fully optioned Taycan Turbo (sic) S goes for $240k. While a Tesla Model S with Ludicrous mode includes many unrivalled features (OTA, FSD ready, SuperCharger network) sets you back a 'mere' $100k.  Fully spec'd with most expensive paint option, FSD package and 21' wheels pushes the price to $113k.  The Taycan, which was built to beat the ageing Model S on every performance metric, has fallen short in at least 2 categories:¬† Slower 0-60 mph, probably slower on the 1/4 mile and a \_much\_ lower range (EPA \~240 miles versus \~370 miles).¬† The Taycan also has far less passenger and luggage space etc.

Don't get me wrong .. the fact that Porsche has gone this route, put so much effort and money into EVs, is great news.¬† This will fatally undermine their ICE cars (which are halo cars for the rest of the world) so it is also a brave move.¬† They might even have just shot themselves in the foot as no-one is sure that, even at ridiculous pricing, the Taycan will be profitable.

Anyway, the Taycan was specifically developed to go fast around the Nurburgring and their most expensive version has clocked a very impressive time doing so (7:42).¬† The early Teslas would over-heat and go into ""limp mode"" on such a long track.¬† The Model S has never been tested there in its latest guise.¬† And no-one knows what, if any, updates Tesla has been holding back.

But Musk tweeted yesterday that Tesla would be taking a Model S to the ring.

Now, I dunno, but I can't see how a Model S can beat the fully prepped, most expensive Taycan in their backyard.¬† Racing, though inconsequential for most, is Porsche's claim to fame, with an impressive 'track' record.¬† The Taycan is the first EV with a 2 speed gearbox designed to get the most out of an electric motor, it has a big fat racing spoiler that goes up and down as needed to optimise traction vs top-speed, including a \~90 degree position to increase braking.¬† It is lower and much smaller than the Tesla, with an even better drag coefficient.¬† Its battery capacity is comparable to the Tesla's (93 vs 100 kWh) and has stronger regenerative braking. It has carbon fibre wheels and Porsche's racing heritage.¬† They claim lighter copper wiring due to its lower amperage, as a result of their much touted 800 volt system.¬† They've taken ages to test and tune it before finally releasing it.¬† You still can't buy one but it's getting close.¬†¬†

Musk has made it clear that the future of Tesla is not in this category but in cheaper Model 3s and Ys.¬† The Model S still uses the old battery format, the 18650 not the 2170\[0\] cells, and a cooling system derived from the first Model S. ¬†How is it possibly going to come close to the Porsche's time?¬† One would reasonably expect the Taycan to run at least a minute faster round 'the ring' than the Tesla.¬† Does Musk think coming within 20 seconds of the bespoke test Porsche will be good enough? It would be a remarkable achievement but not beating the Porsche would be a mistake.

Musk has slayed naysayers before, he does magic.¬† He hasn't made any claims as to what the Model S will achieve but this short tweet is ominous and possibly a master stroke or is it another ""funding secured""?¬† We'll know by the end of next week. ¬†

TeslaMotors,would buy if,8umqhp,So I work at Tesla and thought I'd share some thoughts about it after a few drinks,"I work at Tesla and created an account just for this comment. Talking/sharing too much about TSLA after the ""worker sabotage"" incident still going on seems extremely unwise, however, after reading some posts and having a few glasses of wine, what the hell, after months of lurking I thought I'd finally make a post and say something.

It's a bit difficult sharing my experience without revealing identifying details, but I can tell you my work involves just software development. I have not worked directly in manufacturing or anything directly handling industrial equipment or parts.

As a little background, I've been working in IT for decades (always in software development) and have been in many companies. Some working directly, others as a contractor, always in software. Most companies were quite big. I've been at Tesla for around two years.

So here's my opinion...

Good things...

This is the FIRST company in my career where I have not noticed negative comments and feelings from coworkers. Before this there was always someone unhappy and strongly bashing the company, but at TSLA, all my coworkers seem pretty positive. I'm sure that doesn't mean they love everything about the company, but overall, there's no considerable negativity. I'm not surprised that happens in small groups sometimes, but I'm surprised it has been happening with everyone I've interacted with, in my team or others -  I can't think of a single coworker [I know] who seems to hate the company/his life there. Never happened before, weird stuff.

People seem proud to work there. So indeed, I've seen this before with SOME coworkers in SOME teams, but what is different at Tesla is how widespread [in my universe of work] this optimism is. 

But I'm not a fool and I know this sounds like the usual corporate ""we love what we do"" bullshit, and maybe it is, I only know a little slice of Tesla and I've worked in enough companies from hell (regardless of market cap) to consider these comments as bull - and yet, this is true to me. My little view of Tesla is full of happy coworkers. I'm sure some others are unhappy, but those I work with, daily interaction ALL seem motivated and really trying hard to do their best while seeming happy about it - that's a first.

Regarding the CEO, it's also different. The negativity in some of my previous companies was intense. People had little respect for the top dogs. With Elon there seems to be a lot of respect. I suspect some of that love comes from his media-rockstar-popular-says-whatever-he-wants ""cool"" style, but another - more interesting - side (probably the main reason) is that workers see the CEO having a lot of skin in the game... He has a lot of his $ invested and he spends a lot of time going around and is actually seen doing hands-on work on all sorts of shit (from hardware to software) trying to fix/do/improve things, doing long hours at the office, etc. 

I've heard stories from veterans on how they saw him somewhere doing this or that, some tasks seeming low on the food chain, actually working like the minions do...  and that isn't something I saw in my past with multiple CEO top honchos, not at all.

He also has a reputation for being very demanding, but at the same time it kinda balances it because he seems open to suggestions from everyone (in theory, haven't... tested that side). 

I did not experience this weird ""boss bleeds as much as we all do"" feeling in any of my previous companies... none of them.

So while he makes ridiculous bucketloads of money, at least he's respected for working the same way he demands of us, which isn't as common as one might think. It does influence you. My coworkers grab tasks very quickly and really try to solve them. Sometimes they're clumsy and prioritize wrong, but they're putting the effort into it, there's enough passion. There's a lot of thought about ""the customer"" and how it will look to the outside. And keep in mind that many of these guys can't even afford the products they're coding/working about, but they still seem passionate about getting it right for other people.

This is the usual bullshit you hear at every company about ""our values"", but it was the first time I saw it occur in a realistic way. We don't do/solve only because its our job, we really want to pass a good impression, because we're proud of the product and it feels like a fight to survive and screw everyone who said we can't do it (looking at you, shorters).


Bad things...   



The main bad thing for me is a certain lack of maturity in my area of work. We should be working with more process but instead sometimes operate like a start-up with a dozen guys. You'd be amazed at how TSLA does not have certain systems/practices that are widely used in the field of work I specialized, in that particular field we're at level 3 out of 10, at best, probably due to poor management of that area in the past 5 years. That means we spend a lot of time fixing stuff that goes wrong in production, stuff that could have been avoided [cheaper] at earlier stages with a bit more process and ""by the book"" approaches.

Very often it feels we're working hard, but we're not working smart. That annoys the shit out of me because I don't have the power to just go there and set a whole new process in place. Sometimes I want to leave because of it, but at the same time, the potential is huge and I'm sure it will be fine tuned eventually when things slow down.

The reason for this immaturity, IMO is no doubt the huge speed of growth and the need to survive. Putting out fires, doing it to solve it, but not necessarily according to be best practices that will save us time in the future. And also still retaining a few managers who got used to working in this cowboy way and have zero interest in adding process. This part worries me a bit because I don't think some of our current ways of working can scale. I have many ideas on how to improve my area but don't feel comfortable bypassing my manager, because revealing how much is wrong would no doubt result in dismissal (of myself or my boss, most likely not the latter)

Sometimes it feels we're eating soup with a fork and my boss is telling me there's no time to go buy a spoon because we need to finish the soup real fast or we're done. While it's indeed urgent to finish the soup, it drives me restless we can't spend some time to save us a lot more time (i.e. cost) from there onward.

Anyway, a bit of a pointless rant and you shouldn't take it very seriously because I'm just one guy in one team, so a very limited view of a huge 40K people company. I'm sure there are much worse areas at TSLA where people are sad and gloomy and other areas where everything is perfect, process is super efficient and cutting edge. It's so big you'll always have those outliers.   
I'm only commenting my little slice of experience, which so far,  I think might represent the ""average"", at least in my field of work.

I don't own stock at this time but if I did, I'd be very bullish simply because of the ""no negativity"" feeling. I've seen companies rotting from the inside because my colleagues (and me) ended up not respecting the company, the leaders and the products. I don't see that now, not yet. So that's why I'm positive about the outcome, there's no sense of poison or pessimism or apathy from the inside... people are truly trying.... well, the ones I know at least. :P

TL;DR: Drunkish post. Only company in my career where all people I interact with seem genuinely dedicated to it and actually give a shit about customers and the product. Also admire the effort Elon is putting into it at personal cost. Needs work on some process areas to stabilize, mature and scale better after this crazy survival run is over... it's not a small company that can go super agile and process-light all the time anymore.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,c09gd7,"Just ordered an inventory MS 100D, wife doesn't know yet","This is a tale of a cascade of stupid decisions leading to now. To start, I have been a Tesla fan since before the IPO, and have known that a Tesla was in my future for over a year now. My wife knows of my passion for the brand, and rolls her eyes anytime I bring it up (as a good wife will). I stupidly arranged a test drive last year and was blown away, and have been stalking both used and new inventory MSs since. Have a spreadsheet that is way overkill to understand if I can afford it that includes current car equity, taxes, monthly payment, trade in values from about 10 different places, charging efficiency compared to my ICE vehicle and more. Was browsing the inventory last night and saw a 100D for $78k, and with some additional research and knowing about the end-of-quarter sales push to heavily discount showroom models made another very stupid decision and go to the local showroom.

Because of the aforementioned spreadsheet, I know and can quickly calculate how much a monthly payment would be and how much car I could afford to keep the payment at around the same as my current ICE. On a whim, I went to the showroom to see if the price includes the discount (it does) and to chat with the reps on a slow Thursday afternoon. Then something magical happened, the rep pulled up the internal inventory and there is a showroom 2018 100D MS available in the state, for $69k, a $40k discount and I immediately go into a panic. It has Silver Metallic Paint, Black Premium Interior, Premium Upgrades Package, EAP, 19"" standard wheels, ash wood decor and a dark headliner.

I quickly messaged my wife about the price and discount to warm her up about the idea, but receive no response. I am mentally going back and forth because it is a smidge more than my budget of \~$60k and am furiously punching numbers into my spreadsheet to figure out how I can get the payment down, clutching my credit card in the other hand and two OAs chatting with me.  Ask the OAs if I can remove EAP to drop the price $5k more, and they assure me they could. Still no response from the wife.

And my final stupid decision (for now). Thought, screw it, if she comes after me with a butcher knife I can cancel the reservation and ward her off. As OA#1 runs into the back to finalize the paperwork, OA#2 is still chatting me up, congratulating me, all the good stuff. We get on the topic of overnight test drives, and I jokingly asked if I could have one. I already put down my reservation, I thought, why not? OA#1 returns, and I ask about the overnight test drive again. He runs back, asks the manager, and in a couple minutes comes back with a key. SCORE!! As him and I are walking to the parking lot, the wife finally gets back to me with one word 'Wow'. I decided to not tell her yet, and now have a 100D sitting in the driveway where my car usually sits for when she gets home. I am so terrified for what will happen in about 3 hours when she returns...

UPDATE 1: My oldest had a doc appointment that my wife usually takes him but couldn't because she got out of work later than expected. I jumped on the opportunity to drive the loaner! She will be home already when I return and the kids are probably going to rat me out before I can say anything... developing...

UPDATE 2: Wife has seen, been driven in, and driven the loaner. She really likes it! She keeps asking questions about the discounted one. The only thing she doesn't like about the discounted one is the silver color. Haven't mentioned the reservation yet... still developing...

UPDATE 3: I somehow mistyped and stated DL100D, it is a 100D, no performance, no ludicrous

UPDATE 4: Just got a text with a tentative delivery date of 06/25.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/c09gd7/just_ordered_an_inventory_ms_100d_wife_doesnt/,germanmojo,37832.0,0.7625
TeslaMotors,would buy if,gx8sre,Does anyone regret buying a Model 3 (or any other Tesla)? Why?,"I know this is maybe not the most objective place to ask this, but I've posted elsewhere as well. I'm a realtor and just sold my 2010 BMW 335i. I need to replace it. The Tesla is way more than I intended to spend, but people just keep recommending it, it keeps growing on me, and I think I could swing it. People rave left and right about them. There were things I loved about my BMW (speed/comfort/handling), but maintenance was going to be a nightmare at the 20k miles/year I was on track for. Let's hear the bad shit about the Tesla. Who wishes they'd bought something else and why? EV just not for you? Should have bought a different Tesla? Did you buy the wrong Model 3? Is the Performance worth it?

Quick edit to piggy-back on my own post: How do YOU charge? I own a house, but have no garage. Where I would park the car is right next to the house, but outside and on the south side of the house, so it gets sun all day. Can I charge in the rain/snow/heat? I would have to get 220 installed out there, but that would be easy. I'm just concerned about having a convenient and weatherproof charging setup.

New edit: I drove a Model 3 (Performance) and a Model S today. Honestly, I was a little underwhelmed. The 3 is fast and there's no denying it, but it wasn't something that blew me away. I think I just read so many incredible reviews that I put the bar way too high. The salesman was cool, but seemed like he was too busy to really help me. I said ""Sell me a car!"" and he said ""The car will sell itself!"" And then they seemed to just step back and see if that would happen. The car is cool and I'd say there's a 75% chance I'll get one, but I was less than impressed with my experience at the Tesla service center in Salt Lake. I drove the S because I came back from my drive in the 3 and was unable to figure out how to use auto pilot so they let me take an S out to try it since all their 3s were out again. I feel like auto pilot is a big thing with these cars and it wasn't even covered in the pre-drive run-down. It was all so rushed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/gx8sre/does_anyone_regret_buying_a_model_3_or_any_other/,JWRealtor,6074.0,0.9838
TeslaMotors,would buy if,6kcict,UPDATE: My Tesla Model X 90D Driver side falcon door opened while driving on freeway with my 6 y.o. sitting next to it!,"To the Reddit community

I would like to come back and thank everyone who took the time to read our post. It was your attention that prompted top Tesla executives to step up and address the issue with seriousness. Within 24 hours of posting, we were contacted by John McNeil and Michael Ojaghian and the repurchase process was completed with the personal delivery of our refund check. https://imgur.com/gallery/Y2iwR

There has been both positive and negative reaction to my post as some doubted the veracity of my statements. Other than what I have already written concerning the issue, the accuracy of my statements will be further confirmed when the NTSB has concluded their investigation (and can be attested to by the alacrity with which Tesla handled the refund once this issue went public). This is a matter of public safety that should be addressed by Tesla and all other car companies who choose to employ the same type of automatic door in their vehicles. In my case, my child's life was put at risk by a clear defect in their vehicle which I hope no mother would ever have to experience. 

I appreciate the support of the Reddit community but I did not escape unscathed. It is clear that there are some who would rather attempt intimidation than read a person's account with fair-minded criticality. I expected questions but not abuse as some forgot that my family were Tesla fans which is why we waited a year for our vehicle. I hope my own experience drives others to positively support each other to resolve broad-based issues like transportation safety. In the end, if my story had ended tragically, it would have likely affected many more families on that busy freeway. 

Thank you,

TeslaMotors,would buy if,avxxri,Summary of changes Tesla announced on 28 Feb 2019,"* Model 3 Standard-Range is now available to order for $35,000.
* Tesla released a new Model 3 version called 'Standard Range Plus' for $37,000 with a partial premium interior.
* Model 3 LR is now back. It was discontinued when Tesla introduced the Mid-Range version.
* Model 3 LR now displays 325 miles EPA rated range instead of 310 miles. That means Tesla has stopped voluntarily reducing the score. LR's score was already 325 miles but Tesla was reducing it to 310 to advertise the same range for LR, LR AWD,  and Performance versions.
* The Autopilot page on S/X/3 Design Studio shows two Fully-Self-Driving features to be released later this year. I think that means Autopilot 3.0 hardware should be released soon because it will be needed for these features.
* Model X Standard Range version is now discontinued.
* The price of Model 3 Mid-Range, Long Range AWD and Performance versions have dropped by $2,900. MR starts now at $40.000 instead of $42,900. Long-Range AWD at $47,000 instead of $49,900 and P at $58,000 instead of $60,900.
* Autopilot is now $3,000 instead of $5,000 and it is now called just 'Autopilot' instead of 'Enhanced Autopilot'
* Tesla has now moved three features from the Enhanced Autopilot option to the Fully Self-Driving option (Navigate on Autopilot, Autopark, Summon). This is important for financial reasons because Tesla has been selling the Fully-Self-Driving option since October 2014 but the money they collected so far didn‚Äôt count as sales. Until now, 0% of Fully-Self-Driving features had been released. Therefore even though about 73,000 buyers might have bought FSD until now (my estimate) and Tesla collected about $365 million, this would go to the balance sheet as deferred revenue. With this new change, Tesla is looking at completing FSD features quicker for those who already bought it and they will start selling FSD to new buyers that is already 40% complete (my estimate). If we assume 75% FSD completion rate in 2019, $274m could move from deferred revenue to sales by the end of 2019. The contribution in Q1 could be anywhere between $0-$146m depending on the implementation.
* The Fully Self-Driving option is now back in the Design Studio and the price before delivery is now $5,000 instead of $3,000. However, if you bought EAP before 28 Feb 2018 for $5,000, you can still buy FSD for $3,000. In other words, the two options together used to be $8,000 and it's still the same price. See the details [here](https://i.imgur.com/ykJSg7q.gif).
* In a [blog post](https://www.tesla.com/blog/35000-tesla-model-3-available-now) today Tesla says they will shut down all of their stores and switch to online sales only. They will keep a few locations but those will be converted into galleries instead of stores.
* If you are not happy with your purchase, you can now return the car within 7 days and 1,000 miles.
* The 0-60 time for Model 3 Performance dropped from 3.3s to 3.2s and Model 3 Mid-Range dropped from 5.6s to 5.2s in the Design Studio.
* Model S prices used to start at $76K / $94K / $133K. It now starts at $79K / $83K / $114K. 
* Model X versions used to start at $97K / $138K. Now they start at $88K / $119K.

Wife needs car for work and I love Tesla's (to me it is an awesome toy, her, it's utility).

Some questions:
-	Charging, wall socket?
-	what's maintenance like? no oil change but winter tires etc
-	what's customer service like?
-	what are pain points in cold weather and in general?
-	what's the most annoying part?
-	is it worth taking money from our house fund? (Kind of a weird ass question, but any answers from grown ups would be much appreciated)

I spent hours and hours on research over the past several months and with the recent release of the SR MY and myself purchasing my first home, I thought I‚Äôd finally be making the switch. Please excuse the wall of text; I‚Äôll work on formatting once I get coffee and sit at my PC. For now, I‚Äôm writing this up from my bed as the memories are fresh and I‚Äôm unable to sleep. 

A bit of background: I‚Äôm a 30 year old guy who would consider myself a former ‚Äúcar guy‚Äù but have shifted towards practicality in recent years. Loving tech and finally having my own home to charge an EV, I thought this switch would be a no brainer, but my test drive didn‚Äôt seal the deal for me as expected. 

I test drove the new SR MY as this is what I had decided would be the model I would buy. I wanted to make sure that I didn‚Äôt test drive a performance model and then purchase the SR, which I can imagine feel vastly different in terms of acceleration. 

First thing I noticed- The seats were the most comfortable that I had ever sat in. Truly, they‚Äôre a dream. The white interior was beautiful in person and the leather felt so smooth. Myself and my GF talked about them repeatedly on the ~45 minute drive home, but unfortunately, that‚Äôs where the wow factor stopped. 

Upon sitting down into the Y, a Tesla employee gave me a brief rundown of how everything works prior to our departure. Shockingly, the screen was unresponsive and laggy on more than one occasion and section of the settings. This was extremely surprising to myself, my GF and the employee and certainly disheartening, given the fact that everything is operated from this screen. It occurred again, even while on the drive and my GF attempted to click around. Is this common? I sure hadn‚Äôt seen it in the YouTube videos I had viewed. I‚Äôm not sure of an explanation but I can‚Äôt think of a great one. 

One foot driving- This didn‚Äôt come as a surprise to me like it may to some as I had read about it pretty extensively. But the harshness certainly took a bit to get used to. During my drive, I wasn‚Äôt able to master it and become a smooth driver. Sure, it would probably become second nature after a few days. But with my small taste of Tesla, I can‚Äôt say I loved this feature, but certainly understand the engineering benefits. 

The pano sunroof was beautiful! I loved it but also wondered how effective the tint is when the sun is overhead. I previously owned a 2016 VW GTI that had a mesh screen that covered the sunroof when closed. Even with the mesh and the tinted glass, I still found myself wanting a form of a blackout cover. I can‚Äôt help but think that the MY would also leave me feeling this way at one point or another. I‚Äôd love to hear back Fr on anyone with opinions on this. 

Space- This was my favorite aspect of the vehicle. Sitting upright, comfortable and having tons of cargo room was truly incredible. I also laid down in the back with my GF and I can confidently say that we could sleep in this vehicle if we were to take it camping (I‚Äôm 6‚Äô4‚Äù). 

Suspension- Many reported a harsh ride in their MY. I didn‚Äôt find this to be the case at all. The car rod smooth, lacked major wind noise (single pane glass on this test drive vehicle) and was overall very pleasant to ride in. 

Acceleration- Many people overhyped this for me. Although the SR MY is ‚Äúslow‚Äù for a Tesla at 0-60 in 5.4 seconds, many told me that the instant torque of an EV would surprise me and be very addicting. This was not the case at all. Enough so that I asked the sales associate to come out to the vehicle after my drive to see if the car was on valet mode or something similar. It was truly sluggish and not in any way impressive to me. Context: I currently drive a 2019 VW Golf R with minor modifications that have my 0-60 at ~3.5 seconds. 

FSD- I had zero intentions of purchasing this package but knew I had to try it on my test drive. From lack of aggression to hugging the yellow line around turns, I wasn‚Äôt able to tolerate allowing the vehicle to drive for long. I didn‚Äôt feel initial confidence in it and in very little time, I confirmed the notion that I wouldn‚Äôt want to pay for that feature. One question I do have to you all- is the audible tone announcing a green light available without self driving? I truly loved that feature. 

Overall if I had to rate the SR MY, I‚Äôd probably give it a 7.6/10. It‚Äôs a fine car and may scratch the itch for those wanting a spacious EV for less than a MX, but for me, the hype was far too strong. I came in with high expectations, expecting to leave the lot, placing an order and saying goodbye to my beloved Golf R. But I can confidently say that I won‚Äôt be purchasing a SR MY anytime soon, if ever. I know I‚Äôm disparaging this vehicle in a Tesla subreddit where the fans are passionate, but I wanted to accept the downvotes that will follow in hopes of giving an unbiased opinion that differs from the majority that I‚Äôve came across. I‚Äôll gladly answer questions about my experience in the comments and would love to hear feedback from anyone who is willing to cultivate constructive conversation regarding this topic. For now, happy Sunday and thank you for reading.


EDIT: I made this post with one intention- To educate those who are potentially interested in the new SR MY, more specifically, individuals with no experience in the EV world like myself. I was hoping to learn more, answer questions and cultivate good conversation on the topic and my specific situation. Prior to posting, driving the car and even before researching, a great friend of mine whom I respect a lot warned me that this sub was ‚Äúa cult‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt dismiss his opinion but I also didn‚Äôt allow it to stop me from posting honestly. Unfortunately after reading the responses here, many of these replies are very emotionally charged. I have been downvoted for stating facts, such as ‚Äúno, it was not in any form of valet/chill mode‚Äù confirmed by a Tesla employee. Downvoting factual responses devalues the voting system on Reddit and screams cult following with blinders due to a preconceived dedication to a company. This blind consumerism is something that I‚Äôd urge you all to think critically about and attempt to avoid in the future if you truly love this company as it seems. The detrimental effects of this mindset drive lackluster development and competition, allowing for companies to produce mediocre products and slows innovation. I truly do not see this happening with Tesla, as they‚Äôre extreme innovators and I admire the barriers they have broken. But this type of behavior can easily become the norm for many other facets of life, interests and purchases. 

All of that said, I‚Äôm considering scheduling another test drive. One with a dual motor MY to see how ‚Äúpeppy‚Äù it feels, and in hopes that the screen freezes were an anomaly. I‚Äôll likely report back with an update upon completion of this test drive, but know, it will be another brutally honest review. I expect the continued downvotes but thankfully these made up internet points mean nothing. Happy Super Bowl Sunday, all. And please strive to remove emotion from your judgement when possible.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/lekf4e/test_drove_my_first_tesla_today_with_every/,A7III,17187.0,0.9997

I have a 2015 85D Model S

Heavy investor in TSLA (paid for both cars, thanks Elon!)

We purchased a Model Y to replace an old SUV. The girlfriend's parents live on a dirt road. A road we've taken many times with the S and all other cars we've owned. This damage is from a single trip! I kept the speed around 25mph.

The picture is after cleaning the car. Every single white dot you see is a paint chip. Unbelievable. I'm sure a clear bra would have mitigated most if not all of these but who knew I'd basically have to wrap the whole car?? Don't make the same mistake I did.

Don't buy a Model Y unless you stay in the city or get the rear doors wrapped.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,fgekvl,"As a Chinese Tesla fan, let me say what happened this time,maybe the employee made a mistake.","My English is not very good, there may be grammatical errors, please forgive me.

Maybe you don't know a piece of news that sensationalized China. The results of Volkswagen's Passat and Tiguan were very bad when they tested  25% offset impact  in China.This is a huge scandal sweeping across China. In the tests, the A-pillars of these vehicles were completely broken, the airbags would be distorted, and the driver would surely die.In contrast, Volkswagen's Passat and other models in the United States, the test results are good.Chinese car consumers and the media are very sensitive to the configuration of the same model in different countries.Volkswagen Passat now has the nickname ""mobile coffin"" in China„ÄÇOnce bad news appears, it is easy for Chinese consumers and the media to associate discriminationÔºådouble standard.

The above is the historical background. This time, Tesla model3 has only one controller model in the list of auto parts declared to the Chinese government, which is 1462554 (HW3.0). I think this may be a mistake by Chinese Tesla employees He should write 1462554 (HW3.0) and 1483112 (HW2.5) on the list when reporting to the governmentÔºårandom equipment should also be noted. The Tesla owners who got the car found that some of the vehicle's controller models were 1483112 (HW2.5), which did not match the instructions on the list, so they complained to the government agency.From Musk's tweet, it seems that Musk does not know that there is a problem with the registration list.

There are an amazing number of Tesla and SpaceX fans in China. Every day they guessed on social media (similar to reddit) when Tesla will have a dry electrode + super capacitor battery, and pay attention to each test of the stainless steel starship SN series. They will argue with others because of 5G and StarLink, and they will patiently tell people who lack space knowledge how good the SpaceX Raptor engine is. Every time Tesla's software update is published on Weibo (similar to Twitter), the excitement is forwarded. Many people in China have a type of ""Musk Refresh Disease"", which means that F5 often gets the latest news from Tesla, SpaceX, Solarcity, and Boring Companies in the media.If there is a Tesla employee or who can contact Tesla and tell Musk China is a huge market, many people here are his hardcore fans, but also Tesla fans. A perfect solution to this matter, focusing on the Chinese market, we will win-win.

This is the first time I have written English content for foreigners. I don‚Äôt know how many grammatical errors I have.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,edie8l,"I rented a Model 3 for 3 days and a 500-mile trip as a test drive. My detailed review, for others who are considering a Tesla.","So, I‚Äôve been considering a Model 3 for some time. I‚Äôve test drove one before but wasn‚Äôt comfortable making the change based on the 20-minute drive. So, I decided to rent one for a trip from Dallas to San Antonio and back. Here is my detailed review, I figured those of you on the fence could use some more input.  If you feel anything I wrote is incorrect or based on ignorance, let me know. I‚Äôm here to share and learn.     
   

Car: 2019 Model 3, 250-mile Range, 19‚Äù wheels, basic autopilot, black interior and exterior   

My current car: 2015 Lexus ES 350    
     
 TLDR Summary: Exhilarating look at the future of the automobile. The acceleration is incredible, and the tech is great. However, the road noise and ride quality leave a lot to be desired and some annoying, but minor, design issues hold back the car tremendously. I loved it, but its flaws are too much for me at this point given my driving needs. However, I'd gladly recommend to anyone who doesn't do a lot of long distance driving, even with it's flaws.     
   

The Ugly: (Starting here because most want to hear this, let‚Äôs be real.)  


Autopilot near miss: Autopilot was great 99% of the time. However, we had two serious swerves toward concrete barriers. I didn‚Äôt mind those too much since I was always ready. However, the BIG issue was a phantom stop. We were driving down the I-35 going about 65MPH. No car was close in front of us, yet suddenly, the Tesla slammed on the brakes all the way down to 45MPH. A car that was following us closely nearly slammed into us, luckily, he was paying close attention. The frantic, stressed look on his face as he slammed his brakes was scary. If he was distracted at all, like most drivers are, it would have been a major accident likely causing a pile up. The issue I have with this is I couldn‚Äôt prevent it. By the time I could react and accelerate, the car had slowed down tremendously. I was ready and yet only luck prevented a major accident.     

   

Mileage:  We consistently got way worse mileage than expected. For example, we went from the San Marcos Supercharger to the Waco Supercharger. 149 miles with 220 miles charge, so a 70 mile buffer. The entire trip we got warnings to slow down or we wouldn‚Äôt make it. Ultimately we arrived with 19 miles left, so a 50 mile loss. It was 56 degrees and we drove the speed limit on autopilot. The only thing I can think of is that Texas has high freeway speeds (70MPH to 80MPH most the way). That was very disappointing.  Please let me know if I‚Äôm missing something obvious as to why our mileage was so bad.    

   

The Bad:    

     
 

Opening doors: The door opening is designed incredibly bad. EVERY SINGLE PERSON who I drove around tried to open the door (from inside) using the manual latch. I was ready to alert them so they didn‚Äôt, but I wanted to see if anyone would figure it out correctly. When every single person‚Äôs instinct is to open the door incorrectly, it‚Äôs 100% a design flaw. Just bad.      


Console Design: The console lid closes poorly and opens too easily. Any console lid that requires an alert on the screen to inform people how to close it is obviously designed extremely poorly. Also, it‚Äôs impossible to keep the console lid clean, it‚Äôs awful.  The entire interior looks and feels cheap.     
   

Ride Quality: I understand this isn‚Äôt a luxury car, it‚Äôs an electric mid-level sedan. However, the ride was extremely loud and bumpy. It‚Äôs a tiny step up from my daughter‚Äôs $15k Toyota Corolla and light years below my Lexus. (I knew it would be worse, the ES350 is made to be quiet and smooth, but it was bad even expecting it to be bad.)    



Stiff steering: If found the steering stiff and the turn radius didn‚Äôt allow for much maneuverability when parking.  I probably over weigh this because I must do a sharp 90 degree turn into my garage. It‚Äôs far easier in my wider and longer Lexus, I was expecting the opposite.     

  

Connectivity: Maybe this was a fluke, but we lost our Spotify connection multiple times on the drive. Each time we lost it we‚Äôd test a phone and it could get connected instantly.   

  

The good and great:    

   

Acceleration: Oh, what a feeling! Every single time I accelerated fast was a revelation. It was so smooth and powerful, even being the slowest model. I can‚Äôt wait until I can buy an Electric car so I can feel this daily.    



Charging: Simple, it felt great to be off oil. The thought of never going to a gas station again is like a fantastic dream.  The SuperChargers were easy and accessible, only once did I have to wait for a spot. Someday we will look at gas pumps and wonder why we waited so long. (Short answer: big oil and auto.)     
   

Autopilot 99% of the time: So, I like the Autopilot when I‚Äôm going fast, but I don‚Äôt really feel it‚Äôs necessary. You must pay such close attention and constantly pull on the wheel, so it‚Äôs not as amazing as I thought it‚Äôd be. However, in slower highway traffic it‚Äôs incredible!! There isn‚Äôt anything more stressful than slow freeway traffic and the autopilot handled it like a champ. Having AI handle the driving for an hour of stop and go driving was simply magical. And since it‚Äôs slow, I didn‚Äôt have to stress about being so ready to prevent my untimely death. (Yes, I still paid attention, but I can deal with the risk of a fender bender much better than the risk of a fiery death.)    

   

General Tech: I loved having the touchscreen and it was very easy to use and beautiful.  I got used to it very quickly and I don‚Äôt miss the general dashboard at all. Having Netflix and Youtube available when charging is a nice bonus.    

   

Summary: I love the Tesla Model 3. Its acceleration is incredible and autopilot in slow traffic is maybe the best thing ever. I personally won‚Äôt be making the switch yet. Why? I have to frequently travel to San Antonio and Houston and I just don‚Äôt feel like adding an hour of charging time is something I want to do at this point especially when the mileage was so poor. Throw in the much louder and bumpier ride and it‚Äôs just too much to give up. If I was a city driver mostly, I‚Äôd most likely be buying one right now. (Also, the Autopilot scare left a major impact. I feel like waiting a year or two for more refinement is worth it for me.) However, I‚Äôd definitely opt for the long range, 250 MPH is really 20 0MPH and maybe less depending on the weather. That‚Äôs just not enough for someone who drives a lot. Overall, an amazing time!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/edie8l/i_rented_a_model_3_for_3_days_and_a_500mile_trip/,bobloblaw1978,23087.0,0.9932
TeslaMotors,would buy if,ef96xj,Tesla sold my already paid for model S,"I‚Äôve been trying to resolve this issue with Tesla for several weeks, and haven‚Äôt come to any conclusion because of lack of communication and support received from Tesla‚Äôs team. 

After several months of searching for the Tesla I wanted, 2019 Model S P100d I finally found a showroom model at the Florida Tesla location and placed my deposit thinking I‚Äôve secured it. I completed the registration required by Tesla, got my MVPA with Tesla with the VIN, got it financed, and the payment was sent to Tesla within 5 days of securing my dream car. However, the following week I received an email from the compliance department stating my car, that I had already paid for was cancelled. I tried contacting the compliance department, but I got no response. I was shocked and confused as I got an email confirmation from Tesla stating that they have receive and accepted my payment and set a delivery date, I got this email after the compliance department contacted me. 

So I called my OA (owner advisors) and he informed me that my car was in queue for registration in Texas. Then I called the Tesla showroom in Florida to clear up the confusion and I was assured that the car was still under my name and was still mine and hadn‚Äôt been cancelled. And that my car was at a offsite location being ready for pickup. Although, I had gotten a lot of reassurance from the Tesla Florida team members, the email still did not make sense nor did I receive any furthers communication from the compliance department ie till Monday. 

On Monday compliance department called me and confirmed that the issue would be taken care off and I would soon be contacted by the delivery specialist within 24 hours of our conversation. I was then contacted by the delivery specialist via email confirming that I was getting the same car, same VIN, 2019 model S p100d, that I paid for but that I just needed a new RN (reservation number) for which a link was included in the email. It instructed me to pay the deposit again and so I did. At this time, I was completely reassured that the email from the compliance department was a miscommunication from Tesla‚Äôs side and that it have been rectified and my car was back on track for delivery with no issues in sight. I could finally relax after days of trying to get an answer and be excited about my long awaited car.

Couple of days later, I received a phone call from the same delivery specialist that I had been in touch with. He called and told me that there was bad news and good news. He started off with the bad news, telling me that the car that I had already paid for was sold to someone else during the time my car was cancelled by the compliance department. He went on to tell me the ‚Äúgood news‚Äù that they had a similar model S but 2018 version. By this point I had no words, to understand such unprofessional behaviour from ‚Äúreputable‚Äù company like Tesla. 

I was still trying my best to be as understanding one could be in this situation, and so I asked if they could accommodate me with the car similar to the car I paid for. He said he couldn‚Äôt do anything else and that this was the only deal as close to my 2019 model S. So I said fine, and he sent me a link to the new RN and that I had pay a deposit again. 
By this point I had paid three deposits, ONE full payment for my 2019 model S and still had NO CAR. 

After I had paid the third deposit, I spoke to the delivery specialist expressing my disappointment and asked for them to at least pay for the delivery to compensate for all the distress and downgrade of car. And to my
Surprise the Tesla delivery specialist said ‚Äúthis is a take it or leave it deal‚Äù and that he could not anything to compensate for all the problems caused by Tesla. 

A few days go by of me trying to contact anyone at Tesla, I reached out to all the point of contact I had within Tesla, the compliance department, and legal department to further discuss this issue as they had assured me multiple times that I would get my already paid for 2019 model S. But I have yet to receive any means of contact from Tesla. Then I get contacted by Houston Tesla delivery department informing me that the 2018 model S is at the body shop getting repairs, which I was not aware of that car needed any repairs, and that I would not be able to get the delivery before the end of the year. 

This is what‚Äôs been currently happening, I understand that it‚Äôs holiday season but it is very frustrating not receiving any communication from Tesla. Is there any advice  on how I should handle the situation or who I should contact at Tesla to get this resolved. As I am currently making payments for a car I do not even have. And I would personally like to get the car that I paid for, a 2019 Model S verses a damaged 2018.

TLDR:  Ordered and paid for a 2019 model S P100d and Tesla ended up selling that VIN number and is trying to get me a 2018 Model S.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ef96xj/tesla_sold_my_already_paid_for_model_s/,moh77068,2175.0,0.4326
TeslaMotors,would buy if,nzcb77,"Accepted Delivery of my 2021 Model Y, but...","  

So first off, I do think the car will be nice to have at some point in the future, but the experience I have had over the last several months after purchasing this ""luxury SUV"" (per insurance) has been crap compared to the level of service at other car companies. 

The ordering process - 3 full months from deposit to delivery.

Online was easy, but follow up? Nope. Nada. To this day the Tesla Advisor I was assigned has never spoken to me or replied to my emails or calls. The assistant advisor would respond to my emails, but neither was proactive in informing me of my delivery date changes. I‚Äôd see a date change in the system on a Monday and let it go until Friday when I‚Äôd email asking about if I needed to provide anything else and then the assistant advisor would respond. 

Neither notified me when it was time for actual Delivery. That was an entirely new person who texted me and provided a number and extension that when called directed me to a mailbox that had not been set up and could not receive voicemail. Eventually after some texts and phone tag we connected and confirmed everything was set.

Touchless delivery sucks.

Finding my car was ok...but finding it with 40% battery and a bunch of tesla chargers that were out of order at the Dublin, CA Tesla station was a huge let down, especially as this is my first EV. I eventually found a staff person to direct me to a working charger. Thank you Dustin!

I‚Äôve never bought an ICE car from a dealership that didn‚Äôt provide me with a full gas tank, I had assumed an electric car would have been provided with at least 80% or more charge.

Stress.

I‚Äôve never ordered a car and then heard on the news about how it‚Äôs going to come with less features than before and no one, neither of the advisors, reach out to tell me about the lack of Radar or Lumbar support. Neither was a big deal to me...but no one at Tesla ever contacted me, not even a simple email letting me know the change...WTF?

Also, I‚Äôm really glad I watched a bunch of YouTube videos about the car prior or I never would have known how to work stuff. Not a deal breaker, but again, had I been at BMW, even with COVID, they would have been more helpful and had someone in a mask to show me about the car. I know this because my wife and I have owned several BMWs and have a newer one she‚Äôs recently acquired.

Autopilot and other features.

I currently have a display message about some features being disabled until a future software update. I‚Äôm at 75 miles driven and the calibration is at a sliver away from 100% so maybe 97-99% done. I‚Äôm in California and drove it up and down Highway 680 \~34 miles from Dublin to Antioch (parked at home and let it update) and then drove around Antioch, Concord and Pittsburg over the next few hours on both normal streets and Highway 4 as we ran errands and did some ‚Äúfun driving‚Äù.

Overall.

The car looks great. It drives well. The energy seems very efficient. However I would never recommend to my friends to buy a $60k or more Tesla based on my experience without letting them know first that it‚Äôs a very nice car but expect nothing in the way of customer service. Nothing in the way of follow up from reps, and expect to do everything yourself and pay at delivery to charge your car because they won‚Äôt do it for you.

Sentiment.

I‚Äôm a little miffed at all this, but again, I do think it‚Äôs a great looking car, that runs well, and hopefully after some updates will drive a lot better. If not I can always trade it in for an electric BMW or Ford next year.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/nzcb77/accepted_delivery_of_my_2021_model_y_but/,morbidgames,2348.0,0.9917
TeslaMotors,would buy if,7vbmq1,Why the Bolt doesn't sell as much as a Model 3,"I'm sick of people saying the Bolt is basically the same car as the Model 3 *but available today*. No it is not, and let's not pretend it is. 

Let's start with a simple question:

# What's special about the Bolt if it had a petrol engine?

Meanwhile the Model 3, even if it was petrol, would offer:

* **Attractive, luxurious-looking design.** Design is something subjective, but we can at least agree that it looks like a Model S, a car costing twice as much, combined with a nose that looks like a Porsche Panamera, also a car double the price. The Bolt looks like a bloated version of a Chevy Spark, a 10k car, literally the cheapest GM offering today.
* **Unique interior design.** I'm not going to say it's better or worse than the competitors, because its a matter of personal preference as well, but I'm going to say its a minimalism design that we have never seen before.
* **Rear window that goes further than other cars**. Same here, you may not like it, but you can't argue that it's something new.
* **Alcantara, wood panel in the interior.** This signifies a more luxurious interior. I haven't been in either cars, but I wouldn't be surprised the plastic material is better on the 3 than the Bolt
* **Significantly smoother, larger touchscreen.** I would argue it is better than Mercedes S-class, Audi A8, even Model S and X, or actually, *literally any car*. The Bolt has something similar to other economy GM vehicles
* **Autopilot**. Hardware that is ready for full self driving
* **0-60 time in 5 seconds**
* **RWD (or AWD)**, as opposed to FWD
* **Multi-link rear suspension** (fully independent) vs. torsion beam on the Bolt (same kind of suspension as Ford Fiesta, less advanced than Ford Focus)
* And with it, comes **sporty handling characteristics**, as the reviewers mentioned.
* Extra space in form of **frunk**

____________________________________

In short, even if the Model 3 was a petrol like every other car, some people would still happily pay 35k for it, for the features mentioned above.

How many would pay that money for a Bolt? Would you pay 35k for a car with torsion beam rear suspension?",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7vbmq1/why_the_bolt_doesnt_sell_as_much_as_a_model_3/,ptrkhh,102422.0,0.9909
TeslaMotors,would buy if,fcp9ox,I tried to drive an ICE today...,"I got my Model 3 in October 2018 and it‚Äôs been basically the only car I‚Äôve driven since. Before getting the Tesla I had a 2006 Infiniti G35 which I bought new and drove for almost 13 years. Due to a number of factors, my family hasn‚Äôt been on a vacation in over 2 years, and since I started a new job I basically never travel for work.

So our family trip to Disney this week resulted in some unexpected comedy, when I sat down in my rental Jeep Grand Cherokee with 100 miles on the odometer, and realized I hadn‚Äôt driven an ICE in quite some time and had to reacclimate.

Here‚Äôs my thoughts (in no particular order) after having to drive an ICE SUV again after life with the Model 3;

- Information Overload! It might sound strange coming from a Tesla where a massive 15‚Äù screen renders real-time environmental, guidance, traffic, performance, range, and performance data, but this Jeep was just barfing loads of information jumbled across two screens. 

- Digitized Analog: I have leaned that I truly despise the fake analog speedometer which was rendered in low DPI, laggy, and hard to read.

- Button Overload: I was searching for a way to switch to a digital speed display, but with something like 16 buttons (a field of buttons both on the left, right, front and rear of the steering wheel) I hadn‚Äôt a clue how to toggle the display or if it was even possible. 

- Gimpy Touchscreen: The Jeep has a touchscreen in the center console, and has a icon field of dozens of apps which I have no clue what most of them do. Basic operations like adjusting the temperature had to be done through touch, but the screen did not support any kind of modern touch gestures. Digital buttons had to be single pressed to pan or zoom the map, or increment/decrement the temperature. I can totally understand why car reviewers revile touch screens, that must be what they are taking about. 

 - Engines sound really funny now. I think part of the issue is this Jeep must be using a wonky transmission because it‚Äôs like a toy car sound. ‚ÄúMmmburrrrrzzzzzzzhhhhh‚Äù. There is no ‚ÄúVroom‚Äù. It sounds unintentionally hilarious to me. I swear people in 10 years will just laugh at engine revving noises like what is that absurd noise your car is making?

  - Acceleration Lag and Jerk: Getting the vehicle to smoothly start moving is like a ballet - physically demanding and exacting control of the pedal which requires anticipating the next move and how long it will take. Sometimes it felt like a solid 2 seconds before power hit the wheels, and trying to get power *quickly* also meant you would get too much power. Trying to get the right amount of power meant the power would come even slower. So the dance would be to punch it harder than needed just to get it reving then back off before too much power hit the tires. Of course the resulting engine sounds were totally schizophrenic. I knew but I think never *fully* realized how much not just instant torque, but instant torque at *any power level* makes driving so much more pleasant. 

- Engines need to be started... and stopped. Who knew?! Yes, I totally walked out of the car and just left it running. With the keys in it. If my wife wasn‚Äôt there to stop me I would have left it to run out of gas overnight parked in the hotel parking lot. Or maybe someone would have taken it for a ride. Yes, you have to actually remember to lock these things too. 

- Scotty says, ‚ÄúHow quaint!‚Äù  I‚Äôve never felt more like Scotty in Voyage Home trying to talk to the computer. Except when trying to design the new glass molecule the computer would just blue screen and the movie would end. 

- This was a 2020 Model. I can‚Äôt comprehend how this is what a modern car drives like and performs. I feel like it‚Äôs been optimized by the safety regulators and MBAs to the nth degree and stopped being something worth driving over a decade ago. My 2006 I recall loving and being fun and comfortable. This thing was a cuckoo clock. 

- What is this auto-stopping motor thing? It‚Äôs bad enough it takes seconds to respond while its driving to accelerator input. But pull up to a stop line and try to merge into traffic and the damn engine has to restart first? Another thing that viscerally feels like the car is playing a prank of me. There‚Äôs a button to turn it off, but it resets at the start of every drive.

- Radio is truly unbearable. It‚Äôs like TV before Netflix. People actually sit and listen to these horrific ads droning on for minutes at a time? At least there‚Äôs Bluetooth right?

- Pairing Bluetooth, actually I just gave up on trying. First, it wouldn‚Äôt let my wife, sitting in the passenger seat, which it knows she‚Äôs there because airbags, it wouldn‚Äôt let her pair my phone during our hour-long drive on the highway. Vehicle had to be parked. And of course I never remember before starting a drive since. 

- CarPlay. I think people think this is good because at least thank god the car manufacture doesn‚Äôt control the UI. But my first experience is actually it‚Äôs quite bad. The maps are poor quality. The screen can‚Äôt pinch/scroll/zoom, and doing anything on the phone seemed to interrupt the navigation mode... why?! The nav is on the car screen, don‚Äôt bump off my car nav because I‚Äôm trying to plan a detour or looking for a good food place after we arrive. Missed turns galore. 

- Driving on the highway without my AutoPilot, Adaptive Cruise, guidance computer, upcoming traffic indicators, blind spot monitors, in a janky car that couldn‚Äôt maneuver was waaaay more stressful than I expected. I am an excellent driver, I might like to drive a bit fast, but I haven‚Äôt been in an accident in 20 years and have gotten only one warning for going 35 in a 25 6 years ago. But this Jeep stressed me the heck out on the highway. 

- I could go on but you‚Äôll just get bored of reading. My family *definitely* got bored of me dissing the Jeep real quick. ‚ÄúDaaaaaaad we get
It. It‚Äôs not a Tesla. Please shut up about it already.‚Äù ‚ÄúSorry, but seriously do you realize how long it takes when I put the gas pedal, see like, wow I floored it like an hour ago...‚Äù


One thing I know now more than ever, I don‚Äôt own enough stock in Tesla. God speed Elon and Co, you‚Äôve totally broken the mold and changed driving forever. Not a moment too soon.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,dy6ybb,Pulled the plug on my Model3 purchase,"Despite being a musk fanboy and getting super excited waiting for the RHD versions to get to Australia, then waiting to get a vin, waiting to get a delivery date, then...I cancelled.
My business is in the service sector, and service is important to me and right now in Australia the service is terrible...and this is when you are trying to spend $85,000
While it was a continual nag through the process the delivery experience just tipped it over the edge. Dealing with 3 delivery team members, repeated requests about a pick up location (they were trucking my car to Canberra from Sydney) unanswered, changed schedules without explanation or contact - details appeared on my Tesla account- they finally didn‚Äôt show with the car on the day promised - again with zero communication. 
I want the car but I don‚Äôt NEED it. Spending 85k on a consumer item should make you feel good (if not great). It was feeling really crap so I said no thanks. 
Hopefully Tesla Australia can get through their ramp up and the supply demand situation evens out to a level where Tesla have to start having the basic level of service that I need to feel good about spending that much money on a car.   When they do I hope to finally get a Model3. Doubt I will get a free performance upgrade to a LRAWD again but those are the breaks...
EDIT:
by ""service"" I meant customer service - not servicing the vehicle after purchase - apologies for any confusion

I regret not having the car - but if I had it I would still be really pissed at Tesla and that would spoil it for me.  I am happy to wait until their ""customer service"" gets to a level that works for me, or something else comes along, or the M3 becomes available on the 2nd hand market.  Got to keep my limbic system happy...

The reasons I posted are; 1)I have been a long time lurker and sometimes commentator on this sub so wanted to share, 2) I want Tesla to put resources into ensuring a consistently better buying/delivery experience (in Australia at least) - I never want to buy an ICE again and Tesla is by far and away the best value and tech of any EV now and for the foreseeable future.  

Tesla won't improve customer service until: they need to, they can afford to and they know about the problem.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/dy6ybb/pulled_the_plug_on_my_model3_purchase/,CATFLAPY,13474.0,0.96

TeslaMotors,would buy if,b1214q,What Tesla has done compared to legacy car makers is nothing short of incredible,"There are a lot of factors that have worked against Tesla as they built up to where they are today, and if it was me in charge, I'd have taken a much more conservative, cautious, and ultimately disastrous approach.

**SuperCharger Network** - This is huge. Imagine if Ford had to build out their entire gas station network. It's expensive, logistically complicated, and no matter how great you do, it will never be enough in some places, on some days, and there's very little outside support. Building out a SuperCharger network to give customers the peace of mind needed to buy these cars has cost a fortune, and it's something no other car maker has had to do since *ever*.

If you could build the cars Tesla has built without the cost and logistical nightmare of the SuperCharger network, they'd be substantially cheaper.

**Re-Inventing the Wheel** - Building a car at scale for a new company is already a Herculean task, but doing so with a completely new powertrain and power system is something else. This was a far bigger paradigm shift than gas to diesel, it was on a whole other level. Understanding battery cooling/heating, fire safety, and managing an array of 18650s for 100-150k miles while the ones in my laptop died in 3 years is a massive task, and it costs a ton of money in terms of engineering.

The next car maker that builds what Tesla has built without having to rely on their legacy of engineering, it could be (and should be) far cheaper in the end.

**GigaFactory** - I thought this investment was nuts, but it turns out you can't build 5k+ cars a week without owning the battery factory. Makes sense since that's the biggest component, by part count. Anyone wanting to catch up to Tesla's production numbers will have to source BILLIONS of batteries, and pay all the middlemen along the way while dealing with supply chain uncertainties, and maybe also cross-border tariffs. 

If you could just buy batteries off the shelf, like ICE makers do with engines, it would be so much cheaper.

**EAP/FSD** - They're putting so, so, so much time, money, and engineering effort into this. If I was the CEO, I'd take the far cheaper, short-sighted view and skip it. When this comes online (if, okay fine, IF this comes online,) it will mean billions in additional revenue with virtually no cost. And once it's done, it's mostly done. They can sit back and continue chasing the diminishing nines in terms of efficacy (99.999-how-many-more-nines?)

If they skipped EAP/FSD R&D, it would be significantly cheaper.

**FSD Deep Learning** - Whether you use it or not, your car is a test subject for FSD. I haven't been able to see what they've done with this data, but they've suggested it's making the network smarter, and I can't help but believe them. Anything else would be crazy.

**OTA Updates** - EVERY time I've taken my Nissan to the dealership, they've had to update my firmware. I have no idea what's changed, but it was something apparently worth pushing an update, and I can't get another one unless I go back to the dealership. This philosophy of OTA updates saves them money, saves consumers time and money, and keeps all vehicles on the same update. Remember how older versions of Windows didn't force updates, so when you finally accepted it, the whole system would crash? Kinda the opposite of that.

For people talking about tires and what to do because ‚Äúit's a Tesla‚Äù and somehow different from other cars here is your link https://www.tesla.com/support/results?search=tires

They are just tires. Go to some place and make sure they know about the jack pads and ask if they have jacked up a Tesla before. Here is a screenshot from Tesla‚Äôs support page. https://imgur.com/a/3ZCtnEp

I keep on getting flats/punctured tires. My tesla sucks, I have never had a problem with my other cars in the past with so many flats.

Do you have the sport wheels? They have less room to give. Do you run things over? This is a given. Do you hit pot holes? Hitting potholes with sport wheels is very bad. Hitting potholes with non sport wheels is also bad but you can sometimes get away with it. Do you keep your tire pressure at the right levels? Tesla‚Äôs are heavy and they need to have the right PSI.

Deliveries‚Ä¶. The posts about deliveries and them forcing me to take the car or I lose it. HOW DARE THEY SELL ME A CAR THAT I PUT AN ORDER IN AND MONEY DOWN ON FOR. Shut up and take the car. If you want to wait for whatever tax is going to happen then cancel the order and reorder. Someone else will be happy to take your spot/car. 

This is also the wrong place to ask about taxes/credits/incentives. We are not tax people, this sub is not for that. We have no idea how much you make or how much you would owe or what your finances are. So we have no idea if you will be eligible. Talk to a tax guy. 

No you can not give your spot to someone else. No you can not transfer the spot to someone else. No you can not whatever else you are thinking. Two options. Take the car or don‚Äôt. 

Going forward no more posts about Tesla forcing you to take delivery. This is the last post that will be approved. 
https://imgur.com/a/16JgoWO

Sucks that we need to not talk about delivery things but it just leads to a dark hole of nothing good. Comments are ugly and no one upvotes it. From all this we have guessed that no one wants to see these. (I don‚Äôt want to see these as well)

If you are out of state or someplace that you can not pick up the car then that just sucks and it does suck that Tesla will not hold the car for you but they are treating everyone the same. Can‚Äôt pick up the car well then you have to cancel your order. They are very A or B. There is no C.

The reason why they are this way is because of the people that bitch and cry about Tesla dropping the price and having to hand back money because of the out cry. If you are part of the give me my money back and jumping on that train this is on you. I say this because Tesla will not mess up again when it comes to those types of things. They will treat everyone the same. It‚Äôs a Yes or No. 1 or 2. A or B.

Charging‚Ä¶ Charging at home. Can I add. Can my panel‚Ä¶ These questions are just the wrong place to ask. I understand that when you post to the sub and you are researching by doing so but Google is also very good at doing this. I also heard that talking to an electrician is a good idea. If you are looking to educate yourself then here is going to be a TLDR. I have installed many 14-50s and wall connectors. 

Before I give the TLDR, they are not called chargers. A wall connector is called a wall connector. The charger is inside the car already.

14-50s need 4 wires. Wall connectors need 3 wires. 14-50 outlets and wall connectors are very easy to install. It just takes time to get the wires to the place you need them. I would recommend when getting a wall connector installed to get the 14-50 wires run. It will be one extra wire but it will save you in the end and allow you to remove the wall connector and install a 14-50 outlet. When running these cables ask the person that is doing this to have a pull box above or some place close to the wall connector to keep the 4th wire that is not needed. This also helps if the wall connector takes a shit and is no longer working. You can then have that extra wire run and install a 14-50 outlet.

I have helped many people with this and I do the best I can with telling them what they have but I can not see everything. I can only see what people have taken pictures of. I would always recommend getting an electrician.

If you have a 100amp panel and want to charge faster than your 120. I would recommend installing a ~~10-30~~ or 14-30, as long as its 30 amps then charge at night when you have nothing else on.

Superchargers vs urban chargers. Read here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Supercharger#:~:text=Compared%20to%20the%20standard%20Superchargers,provides%20dedicated%2072%20kW%20capacity.

In September 2017, Tesla announced the availability of urban Superchargers. The urban Superchargers are more compact than the standard Supercharger stalls, and will be primarily deployed in urban areas such as mall parking lots and garages. Compared to the standard Superchargers, urban Superchargers have a maximum power delivery of 72 kW. Instead of 150 kW distributed between two vehicles at a Supercharger A/B stall pair, each Urban Supercharger stall provides dedicated 72 kW capacity.

Wait, my bad, I'll help the lazy with pictures https://imgur.com/a/GxqdvHM

Sounds‚Ä¶ My car is making this sound. Is this a normal sound. Why does my car always make this sound. This sound just started after an update‚Ä¶ 

We have no idea why the cars make the sounds they do. The car can be doing many things in the background. Just plug the car in so it's happy and leave it be. If it keeps on doing this for a month sure then ask service but I would bet that the car is fine and it‚Äôs just cooling itself off or doing something. We do not need to see a video post about a sound that is happening in the front of the car or anywhere on the car.

A Tesla rep said that a scheduled delivery date doesnt mean I'm scheduled to pick it up....... Not kidding, serious, to my face.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,katuxh,Six years ago I bet a friend a ridiculous amount of money that FSD would be here by 2020. Can Tesla save me?,"In 2014 my friend and I bet that before 2021 a self driving car would be able drive from my apartment in downtown Seattle to my friend's house in a suburb (Bellevue) 30 minutes away, without any controls being used after the destination was programmed in. (We agreed that if the wheel needs to be touched without any control applied that'd be OK).

We bet one Bitcoin on this, which at the time was worth about $350 and is now worth around $18,000. Fortunately one week after our bet we put a $10k cap on it, so I actually stand to lose or gain $10k.

I've been mentally preparing to lose for the past couple years, but based on recent youtube videos it seems like I at least have some chance of winning this bet and it may be worth it for me to find someone with the Tesla FSD upgrade and offer to pay them to help me.

I wanted to get some expert advice first: is this hopeless? Is there something that I'm not seeing in the FSD videos that would almost certainly prevent me from winning?

If I do have a chance, do you have tips for making my win more likely? Are some cars better for this than others? I know I need ""hardware 3"". Is there anything else non-obvious that might affect the outcome?

TeslaMotors,would buy if,dsjm3r,CA Clean Air Rebate rule change. S/X deliveries after Dec 3 are no longer eligible. No more $2500.,"Starting Dec 3rd, anyone who has ordered an X or S in California and not taken delivery will no longer be eligible for the $2500 clean air tax rebate. Anyone who has already taken delivery of a 2020 VIN S/X may not be able to apply for the rebate anyways as the CVRP has not approved 2020 models and might not until after Dec 3.

https://cleanvehiclerebate.org/eng/faqs/what-should-i-know-about-december-3rd-program-changes

A MSRP cap of $60k will be the new rule for vehicles to qualify, so the 3 is not affected. (Unless it is a Performance 3 with FSD)

Tesla continues to advertise the rebate as an incentive on their ordering page for CA deliveries even though they know the Dec 3 deliveries will not be met for potential X and S owners. The California service centers were made aware of the change this past weekend, but as of now there is no plan to compensate. (Not sure compensate is the right word but I‚Äôll leave it)

Anyways, I didn‚Äôt see a thread on this yet so I figured I‚Äôd start one.

Elon - Hi! If you are reading this can you help? Prioritize CA S/X/P3D with FSD deliveries.

/u/RealPokePOP pointed out that Performance Model 3 orders with FSD that have an MSRP over $60k would also be ineligible for the rebate if delivery is taken after Dec 3. Not a reduced rebate, no rebate at all. You would have to purchase FSD after taking delivery.


Edit. Please understand the issue at hand is not that the rebate is going away. It was bound to happen. The issue is that Tesla is still advertising and dangling the rebate as a sales incentive for California orders they know will not be delivered until AFTER the Dec 3 deadline.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/dsjm3r/ca_clean_air_rebate_rule_change_sx_deliveries/,munkifist,12407.0,0.8203

The T Tesla logo on the trunk was very crooked, 2 of the 4 door handles were really sunken in, and there was a tiny chip in the paint on the trunk as if it had been opened and banged against some kind of ceiling. I wasn't expecting to be picky, but I mentioned all of this to the service people and they set up an appointment to fix everything. Within the first 2 weeks I took the car in and they fixed all of the problems except the paint chip. They said ""paint isn't done here, it's done at another location so you'll have to make another appointment with our affiliate to get that fixed"". The size of the paint chip wasn't big enough to where I really cared enough to make an appointment to fix it, but that's kind of shitty that I got a brand new vehicle with an imperfection and was told I needed to go to a separate body shop to get it touched up.

The car itself is a ton of fun to drive. The handling, the acceleration, the autopilot (when it works). We installed a roof rack to tie a dog cage to for a 100lb German Shepherd, but we discovered that the cage actually fit in the backseat behind the seats so we didn't even need the rack. The amount of storage space in this car is insane. We went camping in the car prior to our road trip and I bought a mattress that contoured to the shape of the vehicle with the seats down. Me, my wife, and a big ass dog were able to sleep in the car comfortably, and I was able to sleep in a t-shirt and shorts while it was 30 degrees outside because of the temperature control. Just need to make sure you're near an outlet/RV plug overnight so you don't drain your battery while you sleep. 

Anyway, I live in a cold weather state so I didn't know how owning an electric vehicle would go, but as far as charging goes, it hasn't been much of a problem for daily driving. I was ready to install a 220v outlet in my garage, but the slow drip charge of a 110v has been enough to charge it over night for every day use. 

The fact that regen braking is nonexistent in cold weather does kind of suck, especially since I got the car when it was warm out and the driving mechanics dramatically changed after a few months. When I bought the car I was able to drive completely with one pedal using regen braking, but as it got colder outside the regen went away and it coasted just liked an ICE car and I had to use the brakes like any other car. I had just gotten my wife used to the regen braking and then the car essentially disabled it since it was cold outside and she had to go back to using the brakes like a normal car. I'm not saying using the brakes is a problem, but it's weird to get used to the new system of one pedal driving and then having it taken away from you overnight. Once we traveled to a warm weather state the regen came back and we were suddenly back to a different style of driving. I absolutely love the one pedal driving, but I wish I could use it year round, not just when it was warm outside. 

We decided to take the car for a road trip across the country. There were good and bad circumstances to this. We drove from Michigan, to Kentucky, to Florida, to Louisiana, to Texas, to New Mexico, to Arizona, to California, and then back through all those states to Tennessee and back up to Michigan. 

Somewhere in Arizona I decided to clean the windshield with a squeegee at a charging station and when I pressed the squeegee to the windshield, it created a huge crack. I was not pressing hard at all, and there were no prior chips or cracks, the temperature outside was 65 degrees so it wasn't super hot or cold (the cleaning water was sitting outside so it was the same temperature). I called the nearest service center and they said ""well if we can't find a chip it's a free replacement, but if we do find a chip you have to pay for it"". Fair enough. I looked everywhere for a chip along the crack but I could not find any chips at all, just a clean smooth crack across the glass. They, of course, found a chip, but wouldn't show it to me because they already started to repair it, and I had to pay over $1200 for a new windshield. My insurance deductible was $500 so I only had to pay that (lesson learned, buy the glass coverage) but i was kinda pissed they wouldn't show me the ""chip"" in the windshield. My insurance guy said ""I'd be surprised if it were over a few hundred dollars"", I had no idea Tesla windshields were almost $1300 to replace. There were 3 employees that inspected the car and they all came to visit me in the waiting room to say ""yeah, yeah, definitely a chip, yep you had a big chip, yeah"" but they never showed it to me. 

Anyway, windshield incident aside, let's talk about charging. We used the built-in GPS navigation on the car to get us to all our destinations, and usually it was about 2-2.5 hours from charging station to charging station. Sometimes the car would try to get us to arrive at a charging station with only 5% battery remaining, but during the drive it would say ""Drive under 75mph to arrive at your destination"" then ""Drive under 70mph to arrive at your destination"" then ""Drive under 65mph to arrive at your destination"". Well...the speed limit in Texas is 80 in some parts, so sometimes I would be driving 15mph under the speed limit just to reach the next charger without running out of battery. We eventually had to start looking up other superchargers on the route that the car wasn't routing us to, and that meant stopping every 1-1.5 hours. 

Also when we arrived at our Airbnbs, I was always scrambling looking for an outlet on the outside of the house because we would arrive with around 10% battery. Luckily most of them had an outlet that I could use, but sometimes I had to ask the landlord to use them because some people think it costs like $50 to charge an EV over the period of 2 days. Some of the houses didn't have ""properly grounded outlets"", and apparently the car won't charge without a grounded outlet, so I had to go drive to and sit in a Whole Foods parking lot for a few hours to get some charge because I couldn't make it to the nearest supercharger and there was no usable outlet at our Airbnb. This kind of stuff is just an added annoyance. 

Most of the superchargers took 25-30 minutes to charge so we let the dog out to pee, got ourselves something to eat etc. and we were on our way. A few of the stations charged slowly and took 45-50 minutes though and those were kind of annoying. We had already been on the road all day and having to wait almost an hour just to charge the battery made the trip seem a lot longer. An 8 hour drive turned into a 10-11 drive. A 12 hour drive turned into a 15 hour drive. We knew the drives were going to be longer with this car, but once you've stopped 6 or 7 times to charge on one trip you start to get a little antsy. Can't argue with the price compared to gas though, each stop was between $6-12. But if you're following someone with an ICE car during a roadtrip, just tell them you'll see them tomorrow because you won't be able to keep up. 

Cold weather. The first time I started to slip on ice was scary as hell, my vehicle started to turn sideways as I was going down hill because I let off the pedal too quick. I realized that letting off the pedal in this car is equivalent to aggressively braking, so I quickly learned from my mistake. However, the next time I started to slip on ice I was calm and collected and barely let off the pedal, only to find myself still turning sideways again. I was able to gain control of the vehicle this time, but I couldn't help but picture my wife driving the car and hitting a patch of ice. Guess i need winter tires? I dunno, doesn't seem super safe in these conditions, none of my previous vehicles lost control this easily, even without winter tires.

Autopilot. Dammit, I want to love this feature so much, and I do, but I just can't trust it anymore. On our way from Florida to Louisiana I let autopilot drive almost 8 hours and it was nearly flawless, so I started to place a lot of trust in it. However, after that it started to seriously falter. Almost 50% of the time I was driving past a semi, it would SLAM on it's brakes for no reason. If you looked at the screen it showed the semi jumping all around, swerving into my lane (which it wasn't) and just getting a bad read on it's real life position. I thought the cameras were dirty so I cleaned them but it didn't help at all. It got so bad that every time my wife and I would start passing a semi we would both nervously look at each other and wait for the car to slam on it's brakes, which like I said, it did about half the time. One time it slammed on it's brakes and there was a car behind me that also had to slam on it's brakes, and that car had another semi right behind it. It literally almost caused a horrible accident, and after that I couldn't use it anymore unless there were no cars around the vehicle. This is a seriously dangerous feature until they can work out where the actual cars around you are in a 3D space without them jumping around. This is coming from someone who was thinking about buying the $10k FSD upgrade, but after seeing how the autopilot handles highway driving there's no way in hell I would ever pay to trust this car to drive me around in complicated city intersections. 

Anyway, I do love a lot of aspects of the car but it really does have an enormous laundry list of problems in it's current state. I'm going to keep it for now and I don't plan on going on any more roadtrips anytime soon, but the bloom is definitely off the rose. Here are some quick opinions on things:


PROS:

- Acceleration. God damn it feels good to hit that pedal

- Interior. Seats are comfortable, there's a TON of space in this car. The minimalism coupled with the screen is aesthetically pleasing (to me). Compared to other cars, this thing feels like a dream to drive. 

- App. I love that I can set the temperature, charging capacity, see where the vehicle is via GPS, etc from the app. Also control all the windows, trunk, frunk, whatever. Very cool. 

- Toys. All the little easter eggs and sound effects are fun to play with. Obviously not a selling point, but come on...you can't play Cuphead on a Jeep while sitting at a gas station. 

CONS: 

- Autopilot seems incredibly dangerous unless you're driving in daylight with no other cars around you. Random braking on a highway is really not cool. It can't accurately detect that cars next to you aren't coming into your lane, they jump all over and the car reacts to it.

- Cold weather. Living in a cold weather state means you don't get regen braking during the winter months, and your battery charges slower. Also the stock tires suck ass in snow/ice. 

- Rear view mirror + rear window is tiny and tinted(?) making it hard to use during night driving. 

- I have to open the Tesla app on my phone every time I approach my car to unlock it (it doesn't autodetect that I'm near), even though I've reset my phone/keycard a dozen times. I wish the car just knew I was close and unlocked so I didn't have to pull my phone out and open the app. 

- Windshield glass strength. I know some people will be like ""you definitely had a chip in your windshield"" or ""you pressed too hard"" or something, but I didn't. I'm scared to even use the windshield wipers for fear of cracking another windshield. Never had this fear with other cars. 


Anyway, I was really excited to get this car after a few test drives, but after putting it through its paces on a long road trip I don't know that it's all it's cracked up to be. I'm going to give it a while longer before I make any big decisions, but I'm not sure it makes much sense to own as a daily driver in a cold weather state.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/lqd3tp/my_5_month_9000_mile_review_of_the_model_y/,Gizlo,42764.0,-0.8721
TeslaMotors,would buy if,b6m5q8,This may be an unpopular opinion but I love driving my Model 3 with Uber/Lyft.,"I have seen a lot of comments on here deterring people from driving their shiny new cars with any ride share service and I just want to share my experience with it.  I would not recommend doing this as a way to pay off your car loan or live off of because it is a lot of miles and the more you drive, the more risk there is for riders to mess up your car somehow. As a side gig though, working a few hours on the weekends during surges and promotions I am getting around $25/hr. This $100-$200 a week basically goes straight to my savings and my regular day job covers any other expense I have. 

&#x200B;

Back in October when I got my car this [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Z3ZjnwbA3s) came out of some guy driving his model 3 with Uber and getting a lot of happy reactions. Every person I have picked up has basically had the same reaction and most of the pick ups, they have never ridden in a Tesla so I educated them on them and answer every question they have during the trip. Side note, I don't know if its because I am informative or seem nice but I seem to be getting a lot more tips as well by staying cheerful talking about the car. Honestly I could talk about the car forever. By the end of the shift I am a little tired answering the same questions over and over but by showing some people how cool the car is I know I secured Tesla a future sale. I need to start making business cards with referral codes or something because out of the 20-40 rides I have done so far 1 of them will buy a Tesla in the near future.

&#x200B;

So why did I decide to let mostly drunk people in my new car? Well I Ubered with my old Prius before and enjoyed getting out of the house making money when I had nothing better to do. I  never expected making a living off this income and I have yet to have a bad experience yet. (Actually, one girl did slighty ding my car door on something but there was no mark when I inspected it). Anyway, I decided to sign my new model 3 up because the cost of charging was so minimal I would break even on the charging cost on the first ride. There's no penalization for not driving with them after you are approved so I figured why not.

&#x200B;

Right now it seems like Uber has been pretty consistent with promotions where you drive at a certain time in a certain area that they get $3-4+ per ride which pretty much covers Uber's cut. If it ever stops though and the money isn't as good in the future I will probably stop but right now every weekend I only drive for 2- 5 hours for about 100 miles and get around $100. 

&#x200B;

The model 3 isn't qualified for Uber select when you apply but if you go to a greenlight hub they can manually enter it to qualify. Most of my rides have been UberX because I haven't had time to go and do the upgrade. Lyft has the option to upgrade to Lyft Lux but I haven't waited around long enough to try and get a premium ride. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, if you have any more questions about my experience let me know! 

This isn't for everyone but don't let other people influence your decision to not try.

I really enjoy doing it and the more people that are educated about Tesla, electric vehicles, sustainable energy, etc, will just grow this community even more.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/b6m5q8/this_may_be_an_unpopular_opinion_but_i_love/,Onelife11,23302.0,0.9836
TeslaMotors,would buy if,hs1y86,Cybertruck v. Bronco,"I have seen several folks on this sub and others deliberating between these two trucks. I just recently reserved a Bronco, which means I now have a reservation for both.

Best case scenario, Tesla starts producing the Cybertruck (I have a Tri-Motor reserved) in late 2021 and deliveries start mid-late 2022. Let's be honest though, 2023 is probably most likely.

Right now the Bronco (I have a Badlands, 2door reserved) will be ready to order in December and best case scenario will get delivered mid-late 2021.

I think both of these cars are awesome for completely different reasons. My main concern with the Tesla is charging during long road trips in remote locations. For example, I have an annual Big Bend camping trip every March but gas stations are super limited down there and charging stations even more so.

On the other hand, with the solar panel vault cover, I'd never have to charge the Tesla during day-to-day driving since my commute is about 9-10 miles round trip.

The Bronco blew me away and looks way better than I ever expected. I am not really a Ford fan and I expected them to lay an egg on this one but they knocked it out of the park. We'll see what the pricing looks like in a few months and I may cancel my order if it's ridiculous, but I'm not sure how long I could hold out for the Cybertruck.

EDIT: Just FYI I tried to post this on r/cars and they denied the post without explanation and would not respond to my request for clarification. This is the second or third Tesla post they‚Äôve denied for no reason.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/hs1y86/cybertruck_v_bronco/,3_HeavyDiaperz,69457.0,0.9325
TeslaMotors,would buy if,t2t9c4,My Experience with Tesla (2 months in),"  Hello, I really just need to get this off my chest as I‚Äôve had an absolutely horrible experience with Tesla so far and I‚Äôm kind of at a loss for how to proceed. Since taking delivery of my M3LR on December 20th it has just been one issue after another. It seems that there is no accountability within Tesla and they have no interest in making the situation right for me. It has been 2 months, I currently have no heat in my car and had to book my 3rd service appointment for this issue, among others. I live in Winnipeg, Canada, and having no heat is beyond unacceptable. Sorry for the incoming wall of text.

Here is a rundown on how my Tesla experience has been.

¬∑ December 20th, 2021 ‚Äì Took delivery, noticed a couple small issues ‚Äì a gouge in the dash, a misshapen rear head rest. No big deal, it can all get fixed after I get it home. I had around a 12 hour drive to get home, and immediately after getting on the highway I noticed that the rear passenger side window was not sealing, causing very loud wind noise in the cabin. I called in to my sales rep, and his answer was that this is normal and I just need to open it and close it a bunch of times to fix it. I asked him to help me book a service appointment, he said no, as this was a ‚Äúnormal issue‚Äù. 

¬∑ On the way home I had my first instance of the heat failing. I lost heat completely on the highway and my HVAC was blowing cold air. This caused my windows to frost over so I could not see. This was extremely dangerous and I had to find somewhere to pull over. After doing a reset on the car it came back on (around 30 minutes later).

¬∑ This issue persisted, and I had to book a service appointment to get it fixed. Side note, I cannot book a local service appointment. The app makes me book for the service center in Minneapolis and then send a message requesting to have it sent to my local service team. It seems crazy that I have to initially book for service in another country before getting help, and this will be relevant later. The earliest service appointment I was able to book was January 12.

¬∑ January 12th, 2022 ‚Äì Brought my Tesla in for service for the following issues: Rear passenger side window not sealing, gouge on the dash, misshapen headrest, heat not working, center console USB not working with data.

¬∑ Picked up same day, I was informed that the window and headrest had been fixed, the heat issue was fixed with a firmware update, the dash had not come in yet, and that the USB ports would not be fixed, as this was a change in the 2022 models. I said that I was not okay with this and wanted them to upgrade my USB ports to ones with a data connection. Without USB ports in the center console I do not have the newest games that have launched, I do not have the ability to play music from a pen drive (the app is not on my car because it does not have data USB ports), and to use things like the light show I have to remove my dash cam USB drive, or partition it and lose space for my dash cam and sentry mode. The service rep said he would have his manager call me to come up with a solution.

¬∑ The service manager calls me, tells me that they would not be fixing the USB port issue. He told me that this was never an advertised feature of this car and that I did not lose any functionality due to not having it. He said that unless it was expressly mentioned to me in writing by my sales rep I should not have expected to receive it. I asked him if he thought that it was good business for their clients to have to get every single feature the car comes with in writing from their SC, or they may not receive it. He said that he was not prepared for this call, apologized for that, and said he would call me back.

¬∑ The sales manager calls me instead, he was a bit more understanding and seemed to have a grasp on why I would want this USB data functionality. He again reiterated that it was never an advertised feature and that it is not something that I should have expected when purchasing the car. I told him that I found this ridiculous, as these are features that they advertise and mention often. I mentioned recent tweets from Elon Musk stating ‚Äúevery Tesla is getting Sonic!‚Äù and asked him why I should not have expected that I would also receive this. He again told me that I was wrong for expecting this, regardless of any media showing these features in the car. They told me that I should be receiving this at some point in the future, but could not provide a guarantee. I told him I was still dissatisfied, he said that the general manager would contact me.

¬∑ The general manager contacted me, we rehashed the same points as on the previous call. He was more understanding and admitted that not sending out a communication that these features would not be included was an oversight. He did agree that it was unrealistic to expect a client to read the user manual prior to receiving their car in order to learn of this feature being removed and that it should have been better communicated. Despite this, he once again told me that there was nothing that he could do for me. They offered a $150 service credit, I asked why I would need this on a new under warranty car. They offered me a $100 store credit which I declined as well, I had already spent more than $100 on controllers and a USB drive prior to receiving the car. I told him that I would not accept a compensation that I did not consider fair. He said there was nothing else that they would do.

¬∑ February 8 - My second service appointment. I brought it in to have the dash replaced, heat fixed (again), and the rear passenger window fixed again, because the previous repair only lasted a few days. My local service rep has been great to deal with and has really tried his best to make everything right, which I appreciate. He replaced the dash, replaced the in cabin temperature sensor to correct the heating issue, and replaced the window seal to fix the window issue. I had also asked them to take a look at a creak coming from the driver‚Äôs door that shows up when it is cold, unfortunately the day I brought it in was the warmest day we‚Äôve had all winter and the noise was not happening. No big deal, I‚Äôll send them a video and bring it back when it‚Äôs cold again. This is when the service rep informed me that Tesla only covers issues like these when they require a part. If I bring the car in again for this issue and they either don‚Äôt find the issue, or they find the issue and it does not require a part to fix, they will charge me the diagnostic and repair cost. This is unbelievable to me. This is not an inexpensive car and I‚Äôve never had another brand tell me something like this. As I mentioned, the local rep is great and said that if I send him a video with the noise he‚Äôll do a diagnostic and repair without charging me, even if it doesn‚Äôt require a part. While I appreciate this, it still seems absolutely ridiculous that they would charge for this in the first place.

¬∑ February 26 ‚Äì I was going out for the day to do some running around and when I got out to my garage I did not hear the HVAC, weird. I got in the car and saw a notification that the   
 climate keeper was unavailable due to a system fault. I did a reset on the car hoping to fix the issue, but when it restarted I received another error that the climate control required service and that heat would be reduced or unavailable. This is a huge issue, as I live in a very cold climate and every time I have booked a service appointment it takes them nearly a month to be let in. I went to book the service appointment, as mentioned earlier I cannot book a local appointment. I booked for the closest location, in Minneapolis and asked for them to forward it to my local service team.

¬∑ I received a response back stating that the mobile service team would not be able to fix this issue and I needed to bring it in to a service center. So I have two options, drive 8 hours and in to another country, or drive 12 hours to the service  center in Saskatoon, Canada. Again, with no heat in the winter. I told them that this would not be possible, I still have not received a response other than a notification asking me to approve the estimate.

¬∑ I called in to speak to service over the phone, the rep was very helpful and said that this information was incorrect and that my local service team could handle the repair. He said he would redirect the ticket to them and mark it with high urgency so that I would receive a call back the same day. He did neither of those things. I still have no heat and a service appointment booked for a different country tomorrow morning at 9:30am.

I‚Äôm not sure what to do at this point. Yesterday was fortunately a very warm day, but today it is cold again and I can‚Äôt really do too much running around in my car. When the heat doesn‚Äôt work it causes the windows to fog up and creates unsafe driving conditions. I‚Äôll be calling back in once the service line opens today hoping to make some progress, but at this point I don‚Äôt have any confidence in the car or Tesla as a company to make this situation right for me.

I am looking at opening an arbitration claim with camvap.ca to help me get this fixed with Tesla, but I‚Äôm not sure if this will help me at all either. It looks like the end result in these arbitrations is that the manufacturer will buy back the car, which doesn‚Äôt really help me either. I do not want to go back to an ICE vehicle, and any other electric vehicle will not have the supercharger network allowing me to travel across the country. I really do love this car when it is working properly, the minimalistic interior is amazing and it is so fun to drive, but I simply cannot look past all of these issues I‚Äôve had since taking delivery. I really understand now what everyone says about it being a great car, but bad company.

Again, sorry for the wall of text. I‚Äôm really just typing this to get my frustrations out, I know this isn‚Äôt going to make any difference. Sorry for the formatting as well and all the long winded points, I know this probably isn‚Äôt very easy to read.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/t2t9c4/my_experience_with_tesla_2_months_in/,CMusky,624.0,0.9978
TeslaMotors,would buy if,7woloy,[Discussion] I attended The Boring Company's Culver City Presentation. I'm concerned about its ability to win public trust. (x-post from r/technology),"I attended the Boring Company's January 22 presentation to the City Council of the City of Culver City (this is legitimately how they refer to themselves), where they pitched their plan to burrow underneath the town as part of their ‚ÄúPhase 1‚Äù 6.5 mile tunnel. I went with the intention to simply gather information for my podcast, and left with the sinking feeling that the company is biting off more than it can chew.

The Boring Company presenters themselves were competent, capable, and as well-prepared as I imagine they could have been, considering the circumstances. (I'll get to that in a bit.) My two main takeaways from that City Council meeting were:

**1.)** There's a vast difference between selling private goods and winning public trust

**2.)** Any company will struggle to succeed when their CEO (by his own admission) dedicates ""2 or 3 percent"" of his time to it.

Let's backup, and discuss how the Council meeting went before The Boring Company gave their presentation and fielded questions. It shines a light on how much of public work is a slow grind of competing interests, and a stark contrast to the ""move fast and break things"" mentality of many technology companies.

A Boy Scout was invited to the front of the room to lead all of us in the Pledge of Allegiance. And after Vice Mayor Thomas Small discussed the upcoming ""Kindness Week"" at Culver City Middle School, eight residents were each given two minutes to speak on their chosen topic. (I'm not sure how these eight were chosen specifically.) A selection:

One man complained about Film LA‚Äôs (the organization that oversees film permits in the Los Angeles area) abuse of Culver City parking. He was quite emotional and infuriated.

Another speaker - a poet - read a couple poems she had written, one comparing Congresspeople to Baboons.

Yet another discussed permitting requests for proposed cannabis retail stores. 

An elderly man *demanded* the city repair and maintain stop lights. It must have struck a nerve because about half the room applauded when he finished.

After the eight speakers had each had their say, Boring Company's Operations Coordinator Jehn Balajadia gave her presentation. She touched on many of the points available at [The Boring Company's FAQ](https://www.boringcompany.com/faq/).

More importantly, I want to discuss the response from the Council and the public. After Balajadia ended her initial 10 minute presentation, five pre-selected Culver City residents came up to ask their questions.

1.) Marleen Pugach said she didn't want experimental tunnels dug under her neighborhood, which she said is ‚Äúunder seige‚Äù

2.) Judi Sherman had questions about community impact

3.) Ken Mand was a champion of the tunnel and its technology but had important questions about its ultimate effect on the city‚Äôs residents. 

4.) Daniel Lee was excited to see the presentation. But he wanted the city to strongly take into account the proposed access points for entering and exiting the tunnel. Also, he was concerned about the small size of the pods and wished they held more people. He also wanted to encourage local hire, within LA and explicitly Culver City. 

5.) Alex Fish said that although Boring Company was not asking for public cash, they were in effect asking for capital via access to public land that could be used for other means. He had concerns that - if the company were to dissolve - who would be left ""holding the bag"" to guard the tunnel and its access points?

City Councilwoman Meghan Sahli-Wells was the most critical of the five Council Members, and not without reason. Her questions were pointed, and she took issue with comments Musk had made about public transit in December, when he said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a pain in the ass. That‚Äôs why everyone doesn‚Äôt like it. And there‚Äôs like a bunch of random strangers, one of who might be a serial killer."" 

Sahli-Wells wasn't sure if someone (from her POV) as openly hostile to public projects as Musk was the right person to be leading one.

And - taking off my Musk Fanboy Hat - can you blame her? A **self-admitted** side project, famous for selling hats and [flamethrowers](https://www.instagram.com/p/BeeYW0NA1HU/), wants to use land underneath your city. And many of your constituents - the ones you represent - are vocally wary or even hostile to the idea. What would you do? How would you feel?

Sahli-Wells followed up with, ‚ÄúIt looks super sexy and super easy, but it‚Äôs half baked. It‚Äôs half baked from a public perspective.‚Äù

And, simply based on how Boring reps handled the presentation and ensuing Q & A, she wasn't wrong. The employees seemed underprepared to face anything resembling hostility. Which brings me back to my original two points:

**1.)** There's a vast difference between selling private goods and winning public trust

I doubt a Culver City Council meeting had ever been that packed. Nearly every seat was taken and there were two dozen people standing in the back of the room. And there were a LOT of Pro-Musk folks there (myself included). And it was enlightening to see how Musk loyalists would react to certain questions posed by the Council / public, and how ""regular"" people would react. I think it's a bit akin to watching all of the Harry Potter films AFTER you've already read the books. Your mind invisibly, subconsciously fills in a lot of gaps, to the point where you don't even recognize they exist.

But there's a vast difference between the relationship that exists between a private company and a prospective buyer, and a private company and the larger public. And it all boils down to: Consent. It's the important distinction between consciously buying a U2 album, vs [having it automatically installed on your phone](https://gigaom.com/2014/09/10/u2-on-my-phone). When you walk into a Tesla store, you make the conscious choice to enter. You're already signaling *some* level of interest to the company by simply walking through the door. That signaling then ratchets up and down based on your actions - are you engaging with an employee in the showroom? Are you asking questions? Or are you turning around and immediately walking out?

You'd be hard pressed to find a Tesla store chockfull of people who don't **actively** want to be there. If you do somehow encounter this scenario: Call the police, because we've got a hostage situation.

A public / private partnership is an entirely different beast. Instead of members of the public coming to *you* (The Company) and entering *your* space, you are pitching / begging / bribing / goading / forcing your way into *their* space. Suddenly, instead of a scenario in which 100% of the people you're interacting with agree to the interaction, you're fighting tooth and nail to claw your way to 50.1%. 

And The Boring Company representatives weren't equipped to do that.

Which brings me to -

**2.)** Any company will struggle to succeed when their CEO (by his own admission) dedicates ""2 or 3 percent"" of his time to it.

Elon has publicly said that, after he spends most of his time as the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, 2-3% of his time is spent on The Boring Company. And it showed that night. I‚Äôm incredibly sympathetic to the employees who were tasked with presenting the proposal to a not entirely supportive public, but they were in many ways underprepared. And who can blame them? When a boss is running one company intent on disrupting the automobile industry, and another on revolutionizing space travel, how much time every day does he spare the employees giving 100% of their time to his 3% side project? 

A CEO fully, 100% invested in Boring Company would have been felt in that presentation. Musk wasn‚Äôt.

What's so frustrating about all of this, is that the more I learn and understand about The Boring Company's proposals, the more I examine it from a [First Principles perspective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV3sBlRgzTI), the more excited I get about its mission. 

As someone who teared up as the Falcon Heavy Stage 1 boosters landed in-sync on their landing pads, who has been waiting since March 31, 2016 for a Model 3... 

I believe the best way for The Boring Company to succeed in its mission to revolutionize public transportation is for Musk to hand over the CEO reins to someone else.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7woloy/discussion_i_attended_the_boring_companys_culver/,FUTURESPEAKshow,4417.0,0.9863
TeslaMotors,would buy if,khw5ak,Does any Model 3 Performance owner here wish to have gone with a M3 LR instead? (or the other way round),"I'm at the brink of purchasing my first Tesla due to pretty awesome tax benefits and perks we currently have for EVs in my country, but I'm still very uncertain about which Model 3 to go with. I've browsed through so many threads here and watched dozens of youtube videos and I'm pretty much aware of most of the advantages and differences between both cars, but the decision is still not an easy one at all.

I thought asking the question the other way round could bring some new light to it. Instead of asking why you chose your version I would like to know if there are people out here who regret getting the M3P (or LR for that matter) for whatever reason.

My concerns are mainly comfort and noise level. I know it's mainly down due to the different wheels, but in my jurisdiction it's not that easy to just mount 18 or 19"" wheels which fit on the car. I've driven the 2020 performance for a short time and it was just amazing, but I haven't had the chance to get to drive a car with aero wheels yet, so I'm not sure what I'm ""missing out"" on those points.

Would appreciate if someone who had the same concerns and got the performance anyway could share some thoughts on this.

Thanks!

**Long Story ‚Äì Short Hand Version (feel free to skip to impressions):**

Insufferable Tesla Fan Since 2005

Planned to buy Model 3. Camped out ~4am on reservation day at store. Seemed like right size / price. Expected to spend $60k for 75D or P75D Model 3 financed over 60 months. $800 / month planned.

Got used Volt May 2016 as a holdover till the 3 when my last lease expired. Great choice as holdover ‚Äì highly recommend.

Had an opportunity to drive an S for my 3rd time in March. Realized how much I really loved the S and not just because it‚Äôs a Tesla. I like the way it drives. I like the size. Most importantly, I ended up being really surprised ‚Äì I could afford a recent AP1 CPO. It came out to $800 / month for 72 months. Was still struggling with the decision, but on my birthday a Dark Blue 85 AP1 w/ gray interior showed up on CPO so I bought it. 45 day delivery window ‚Äì being prepped at Chicago CPO processing center then shipped to FL.

Fast forward a bit and they lowered the price of new 75D, which is the cheapest new version I‚Äôd consider (need the range for emergency drives from Miami to Orlando). Now new was only $7500 more after all things considered (taking in to account tax incentive) than the CPO. So I converted to new and here I am (thanks to those who commented on that thread to help me decide).

My payments are ~$830 / month for 72. Needed a decent down payment for that but no more than I was expecting for the 3. That 1.49% apr helped a bit too. But it ended up being surprisingly close to what I expected to budget for the 3.

**First Impressions**:

The S has been fantastic. I‚Äôm 1200 miles in and no issues on delivery. I took a literal 100+ point checklist and clipboard with me. Two jobs ago I was new model launch sheetmetal quality manufacturing for a major manuf and I was‚Ä¶ satisfied. I‚Äôll say the exterior quality was at par with competition. Nothing bad enough for me to complain about it or expect functional issues down the road. The A/C can have a surprisingly loud hum when first turning on if particularly hot outside, but I‚Äôll wait till my first tire rotation to ask the service center about it. Might be working as intended - not that bad.

Transitioning from the Volt to the Tesla has been an incredible experience. Of course it is nice to have a car with power again. Though it doesn't feel as fast as it is since there is so little drama. But the 75D is plenty fast. I have less P100D envy than I expected. I‚Äôm glad the Volt taught me what 40 miles really feels like. Whenever I start to get a little range anxiety because I *only* have 80 miles left, I remind myself that‚Äôs 2 Volts and my worries go away. The Volt experience was plugging in at every opportunity. Now I drive by public chargers because there are better spots or I just don‚Äôt need to bother plugging in. The range of the 75D is so much excess for any local driving situation. Just don‚Äôt think about it anymore. People always ask me where to find chargers when I show them the car and my answer is always ‚Äúat home‚Äù. Don‚Äôt need to plug in anywhere else. But I do have a supercharger right next to my office if I ever need to top off before a long drive.

Autopilot is nothing short of life changing. I am more willing to go places and do things further away than I was before. I‚Äôve visited friends that are an hour away and stayed out a bit later at night than I would have without the AP. I‚Äôm still paying attention and not using my phone, but the reduction in stress and energy to drive with AP is incredible. I‚Äôm on track to drive double the number of miles per year than any car I‚Äôve owned before. But more surprising to me is how happy I am I went with AP2. I know AP1 is much more refined right now, but having used autopilot on highways for ~800+ miles I‚Äôm more excited than I expected I would be about the potential of AP2. I honestly think I would have been kicking myself for getting an AP1 CPO at this point.

Brake hold is something I didn‚Äôt expect to love as much as I do. I expected to get true 1 pedal driving with the Tesla, but that seems to have been removed. It gets down to ~5 mph and you brake the rest of the way. However, this experience mixed in with brake hold when you come to a stop is such a nice UI. I wouldn‚Äôt want it any other way at this point.

Nav is amazingly beautiful, well integrated, and very easy to use ‚Äì but the directions kinda suck. The phone dock is great and converting it to USB C wasn‚Äôt that tough. Interior storage within driver reach is so much better than I thought it would be ‚Äì center console and under screen storage seem to swallow anything I throw at it. The smaller frunk does not matter nearly as much as I expected ‚Äì threw an inflatable bed and pillow and sheets in there along with a set of window shades for an unexpected camp out and I haven‚Äôt opened it since (except to show people that it has a frunk). Glass roof is stunning and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd take the sunroof even if it were free. Summon is the best way to freak out little kids. Charger is harder to plug in than I expected ‚Äì requires a good shove.

tl;dr ‚Äì Model S for 72 mo ended up being similar $$/mo compared to my planned Model 3 for 60 mo. Highly recommend the switch if you are in the same boat as I was.

Let me know if you have any specific questions about Volt vs Tesla living or specific S 75D stuff. And pm if looking for referral codes. I just need 1 so my nephew can get his little Tesla.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,ev6nh0,"Standard Range Model 3 MVPA - $1,590 cheaper than the SR+ w/ AP - $4,590 less w/o AP","I haven't seen too many posts with exact pricing so I figured I would post this in hopes it clears up some confusion. I placed an order on Tesla.com for a SR+ and then contacted my local service center letting them know I needed help switching it over to SR. The sales advisor gave me his cell phone # and told me to text or call him if I had any questions. The change reflected in my account in ~24hrs and was confirmed with an email showing the updated specs. I ordered July 18th and took delivery July 31st. Was hard to confirm then, but it did indeed come with HW3.0! The car said Standard Range in the menu but still had immersive audio, rear heated seats, and 20 extra miles of range (now 30mi difference). They eventually took these away but we don't have anyone in the back seats, audio still is better than anything I've ever owned w/o immersive, and the extra range is negligible because we don't drive further than 220mi regularly. I took a couple of road trips this summer and didn't have a single issue. $35 for a ~700+ mile road trip that usually costs $140!! 

~~If you're thinking about buying a Model 3 and don't care about not having Autopilot, the cruise control is Autopilot but you're steering. I use this more than AP as I'm extremely confident in the stopping/acceleration abilities, but the steering is improving and still has some kinks to iron out.~~ TACC is only included with AP. SR w/o AP still has all the active safety features which do come standard in all of the vehicles including automatic emergency breaking, front collision warning, side collision warning, obstacle aware acceleration, blind spot monitoring, lane departure avoidance, and emergency lane departure avoidance.

For ~$5,000+ in total savings vs. Standard Range Plus, the Standard Range Model 3 doesn't feel like it's missing anything. Extremely good deal for anyone looking to find a way to make financing or purchasing one possible!

Meet Joules & Juice. 

About 6 months ago I started getting interested in electric vehicles. My wife and I have always been avid fans of fast, fun to drive cars (usually with large gas guzzling engines). 

In September we rented a Model 3 for a weekend trip to Chicago. From the first launch, I knew i had to have one. I spent the next month or so nagging my wife until she finally relented and we took delivery of Joules (LR RWD) in early November. 

My wife went from swearing we‚Äôd never own an electric vehicle, to stealing my car from me several times a week and leaving me with her beloved Hemi equipped Grand Cherokee. 

As the end of the year approached, I told her if she thinks she may want to switch to a Model 3, she had to make the decision quickly as the tax credit is halving soon. 

Long story short, yesterday we picked up Juice (AWD). We went from a being a family with a long tradition of gas guzzling hot hatches, and SUV‚Äôs to owning not one, but two electric vehicles. I don‚Äôt think even the most bullish analyst can account for how transformational the TSLA ownership experience is and how it completely alters the way a consumer views transport. 

Honestly, they could have told me that the car uses a type of fuel that is just slightly worse for the environment and is only sold at a station that‚Äôs just a few miles out of my way to/from work and i still would have been on board.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,e0e4gs,Why the Cybertruck design may have actually been genius,"One of the driving factors behind a lot of decisions on the project had to have been Rivian, Tesla's main competitor for the Cybertruck. ('Tesla's main competitor.' How funny those words sound. Has the electric revolution finally come so far?) In order to keep their edge, it wasn't enough to have it outperform the Rivian, which people are expecting anyway, cause it's Tesla. They had to do it for cheaper. Making the Tesla pick-up affordable was one of Elon's mission statements all along. And to do that, they had to make serious cuts in non-critical features.

The feature that seemed to take the biggest hit was the exterior. And why not? Pick-up trucks get dinged doing what pick-up trucks do. They skipped the pressing process, which means no more sexy curves. They chose stainless steel, so no more expensive finishes. I'm sure there were many more cuts, but the design team took these constraints and ran with it. One thing was certain: this truck was not going to be conventionally beautiful. So it would have to be unconventionally beautiful, or at least interesting. They went in with the plan to work this unavoidable bug into a feature, and I think they did the best anyone could have. Whether you like the design or not, the design is turning heads, and not even away from it.

And that right there is the feature. I've noticed there's a certain golden ratio when it comes to commercials, or really anything you do for publicity. Commercials need to be a certain level of annoying. Too much and you refuse to buy the product. Too little and you forget it exists. It's a delicate balance that has toppled many a product line. The Cybertruck seems to have hit that balance close to the mark, though only time will tell just how close. Even my initial reaction was ""oh dear."" But a lot of people seem to be coming around. It's ugly, but the kind of ugly you can get used to. If it had been designed to be in a sci-fi movie, I would even say it looks damn cool! So maybe not even ugly. It's just a little too unusual for most people to want to show up to work in. But all the heated discussion on the wildly different opinions is just free advertising. It's already reached meme status!

As to competing with the Rivian, I think they nailed it. Now, the specs of all of the Rivian's trim levels aren't out yet, but the 'starting at' price of the Rivian is the price of the top notch Cybertruck, and the tri-motor can out-perform the Rivian in nearly every category. Faster acceleration, 500 miles of range, and a towing capacity of seven fucking tons! That thing's cheaper than what I payed for my baseline X, and it makes my X look obsolete! One way or another, the design of the Cybertruck was a revolution in the electric age... if people can get past the look. I'm interested to see if their gambit pays off.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/e0e4gs/why_the_cybertruck_design_may_have_actually_been/,[unknown],,0.9837
TeslaMotors,would buy if,c2wd0h,"There aren't a lot of Model 3 reviews from ""traditional"" car enthusiasts, so I wrote my own","While I know the Model 3 has been out for 2 years now, it seems a lot of reviews are from Tesla fans and not so much ‚Äútraditional‚Äù car enthusiasts, so I thought I‚Äôd write a review voicing my opinions. That, plus I want my thoughts recorded for my own posterity.

For some time now, I‚Äôve been considering purchasing a Tesla Model 3. I‚Äôm generally a more frugal car enthusiast, and spending $39.9k on any other car would be nuts to me, but the Tesla at least on paper offers a lot to like: there‚Äôs of course the instant acceleration at any speed, but there‚Äôs also the super low CoG, lack of distractions in the cabin (so you can focus on driving!), no warm-up and cool-down procedures, OTA updates that occasionally bring performance and range increases, and no guilt associated with lots of unnecessary driving, which I personally do value. I was also very tempted by Autopilot, since there are times I just don‚Äôt care to drive and would be perfectly happy to let the car do the work.

So, to assuage my curiosity, I rented a long-range RWD model for two days from Turo. I spent a couple minutes adjusting settings, drove off, and‚Ä¶ instantly hated it. Right off the bat:

* I could not for the life of me get the seat into a comfortable position. The seat bottom was bolstered too much and cut into my thigh, the pressure on my back was awful no matter where I put the lumbar support, and the headrest intrudes forwards and *doesn‚Äôt adjust at all* so when sitting upright, your head actually touches the seat before your shoulders do. Try to put your shoulders against the seat too, and you end up sitting like a hunchback. I absolutely *hated* this, and despite frequently adjusting the seat throughout the two days, I couldn‚Äôt make it any better.

* The driver‚Äôs mirror doesn‚Äôt adjust far enough out. I like to follow the recommended method for [eliminating blind spots]( https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a15131074/how-to-adjust-your-mirrors-to-avoid-blind-spots/) but couldn‚Äôt move the mirror far enough to do so.

* The turn signal is BMW-style in that it doesn‚Äôt stay where you put it, but rather springs up after you press it so it‚Äôs impossible to tell what it‚Äôs doing by feel alone. Even BMW is reverting on this because it‚Äôs so awful. That said, I did eventually get used to it.

* The car was dog slow. Punch it, and it accelerated at a Civic pace. I‚Äôve driven Teslas before, so I knew that wasn‚Äôt right. I eventually found out the car was in Chill Mode, and I fixed it. BUT, my time spent driving it in Chill Mode made me realize just how much of the enjoyment of this car is dependent on acceleration. Take away the acceleration, and you may as well be driving a slightly quieter Civic.

But after getting to drive the car some more, I found there were definitely a number of things I liked:

* Acceleration at most speeds was solid. While this was no P100D, it definitely has good low-end torque, and of course acceleration is uninterrupted by gear changes. I found it started to run out of steam after 60 or so, and there wasn‚Äôt much of anything left after 80. Still, great for darting around traffic.

* The traction control is the best I‚Äôve ever encountered. While I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs possible to turn it off, I don‚Äôt really care: while you can feel it working, it‚Äôs very unobtrusive, and its purpose is more to help put the power down in low-traction situations than to limit power. A huge change from the TC in my Mazdaspeed3, which just cuts engine power at the first sign of wheelspin.

* I like the interior overall. The lack of buttons encourages you to focus more on driving (though it does forego something I‚Äôll discuss towards the end), and the touch screen is very responsive with a mostly-intuitive layout. Materials were nice, but nothing special. The dash is soft touch, though it actually looks like hard plastic. The piano-black plastic trim in the center was unsurprisingly already scratched despite the car only having 10k miles, and the 12v outlet was in a place that left me scratching my head, but I enjoyed the clean minimalism overall. I do think wiper and headlight controls should *not* be in the touchscreen, since they‚Äôre safety-related. 

* Steering had a nice weight to it: in sport mode, it was actually heavier than my MS3, whose weight I already felt was quite good. I did not ever take it out of sport mode.

* I could leave the AC on, and not worry about it robbing power from the engine. In my MS3 (and virtually every other gas car) I try not to use AC for this reason alone, but in the Tesla, no problem.

* Autopilot in heavy traffic was heavenly. Move to the center lane, engage AP, and let the car do the work. I don‚Äôt drive much in heavy traffic, but if I did, it would be difficult to *not* get this car based on that alone. I found it was unfazed by rain too, which was a nice bonus.

* The driving definitely was guilt-free, as I‚Äôd hoped. I did a number of unnecessary trips, and was excited to do so. Didn‚Äôt need to give the car any time to warm up or cool down, and while of course I used more battery punching it, I had no qualms doing so because a) pollution externalities are minimal, b) cost was minimal, and c) I knew I‚Äôd have a ‚Äúfull tank‚Äù again the next morning, thus the extra ‚Äúfuel‚Äù used hardly mattered. Except‚Ä¶

* ‚Ä¶I was planning to charge in my garage using my dryer outlet. Turns out I had the wrong type of outlet, so I charged the first night on 120v, but only gained ~45 miles of range over ~10 hours. So the next day I used a supercharger. Supercharging was great though: spent only about 40 mins there, went from 64 miles to ~250, and it cost $10.80. So about a third what it would cost to gas up my premium-fuel MS3.

But unfortunately, while I *really liked* those positives, there were also a lot of things I really hated:

* The aforementioned seat comfort. That alone would be a reason for me to not get the car. It was *really* bad. That‚Äôs why you try before you buy!
 
* Missing features. The two biggest for me were Carplay and ventilated seats. I spoke to a guy at the supercharger who said he just uses ‚Äúhey Siri‚Äù as a substitute. Yeah, that‚Äôs not really a substitute. He also seemed unaware ventilated seats were a thing now. 

* The center screen rebooted on me twice while driving. No idea why; the owner swears she‚Äôs never had that happen. To its credit, it didn‚Äôt affect drivability, even with AP running the second time, and it resumed navigation when it started back up. 

* The glass roof. You can‚Äôt even really see/enjoy it while driving, but you can certainly *feel* it. I‚Äôm in Texas; while it only got up to 89 degrees, that afternoon sun beating down on my head was unbearably bad, despite the tint. I can‚Äôt imagine how it would be on a 110 degree day. And no, there‚Äôs no cover for it, so you get the full force of the sun on your head no matter what. And of course no ventilated seats, so my back got quite sweaty. I cranked the AC more than I usually would, but all that meant was my hands were freezing while my head and back were hot and sweaty. I was not a fan (heh). Fortunately there are third party sunshades available, but it seems ridiculous to me that customers of a $40k car should need to provide their own non-integrated solution.

* As I said, AP was great in heavy traffic. It was usually okay in free-flowing traffic. But when it wasn‚Äôt okay, it *really* wasn‚Äôt okay. Phantom braking, giving up on sweeping curves mid-curve (and reverting to going straight, forcing me to wrestle control), sometimes seeing stopped cars and other times plowing towards them, giving up on perfectly safe lane changes mid-change, waiting 5 full seconds before even beginning a lane change, braking to merge in behind someone when there‚Äôs plenty of space up ahead, waiting a while to accelerate again after someone made a right turn in front of me (and then accelerating at a snail‚Äôs pace), and so on. In anything besides super-heavy and completely free-flowing traffic, it was often more trouble to use than it was worth. I found myself yelling at the car and wrestling control (sometimes out of desire, sometimes out of necessity) quite often.  
All that said, I‚Äôd rather have *some* AP than not have it at all, so I can‚Äôt complain too much.

* I‚Äôm a big fan of basic cruise control, but the only cruise this car offers is traffic-aware, which means if you want to just cruise there‚Äôs no way to avoid the phantom braking and freakouts when people merge in 200 ft ahead. You also can‚Äôt approach a car from behind and manually pass it, because it will have started braking long before you‚Äôre anywhere near close enough to require passing. It‚Äôs almost as though the car would prefer you to just sit in the free-flowing passing lane, which is obviously not okay.

* One-pedal driving took some getting used to, but I did. But while I like the concept, I‚Äôm putting this in the negatives section because execution could be way better. The Chevy Bolt has a paddle you can pull to enable regen, which I much prefer as it allows you much finer control while also allowing you to rest your foot and just coast as you would in a gas car. Also, regen alone won‚Äôt bring you to a full stop, whereas in other EVs it will. 

* You definitely feel the weight of this car. I took it on some scenic roads, and while I never really drove beyond 5/10ths, you could still feel the car‚Äôs desire to plow ahead when pushed‚Ä¶ but at the same time, the low CoG and good TC kept it reasonably planted. It was kind of a weird combination of sensations, and I suspect the overinflated (45 PSI) tires didn‚Äôt help.

* While steering weight was good, steering feedback was fairly poor. It wasn‚Äôt full-on disconnected, but it wasn‚Äôt very communicative either.

* This is not a practical car cargo-wise. I went shopping and bought four stacking chairs. They‚Äôd fit in my MS3 no problem; in this, I really had to finagle them to fit into the rear seat area. This alone is why I was honestly more intrigued by the Model Y, what with it having a hatch instead of a trunk, but since the base model won‚Äôt be out for another 2 years, I thought I might just put up with the limitations of a Model 3 until then. Eh.

But all of these pale in comparison to the two biggest drawbacks I found:

* ‚ÄúTesla people.‚Äù I don‚Äôt want to paint with a big brush, as I‚Äôd still consider myself one; but there tend to be two types of people drawn to Teslas: a) car people who like the car for its performance and abilities, because despite my complaints above it‚Äôs a solid daily overall; and b) ‚ÄúTesla people‚Äù who came from Camrys and Priuses and have never experienced any other car in the $40k+ range (or even another performance car in general) and thus think Teslas are the greatest cars in the world. They‚Äôre people who post [memes like this.]( https://i.redd.it/7bkhyjhetbw21.jpg) They‚Äôre people who would never even consider any car that isn‚Äôt a Tesla, and as a result don‚Äôt know or even care what other cars have to offer. The guy at the supercharger who didn‚Äôt know ventilated seats were a thing is a ‚ÄúTesla person.‚Äù Same with the owner of the car, who admitted she didn‚Äôt care about cars until she bought her Tesla. While obviously this is not a fault of the car, it annoys me because if half the potential market is okay with locking into a single brand of car forever, it discourages other EV competition that‚Äôs sorely needed. Plus the smug factor *can* be annoying, depending on how it‚Äôs presented.

* Nothing about this car really evokes emotion. Some may find it odd that I even care, but this is actually the #1 thing I care about when test driving a potential new car. I want to feel emotionally connected to the car, between driving it, staring at it, or even just daydreaming about it.  
So why couldn‚Äôt I connect with the Tesla? I think the biggest part of it is the lack of analog experience. As humans, we are intuitively attuned to analog, physical, even visceral experiences, *even when those experiences are imperfect.* It‚Äôs why playing with your dog, or having sex with a human you love, are so much more satisfying that interacting with a perfectly obedient dog on a screen or watching a perfect 10 in a porno. In many cars, you get this experience in a number of ways: Exhaust note. Turbo spool. Craftsmanship. Manual transmission. Oversteer. Road feedback. Engine rumble. And in the Tesla, with its relative lack of driver engagement, you just don‚Äôt get that same experience. In fact, a good chunk of Tesla‚Äôs MO is about actively *hiding* that experience, what with the focus on self-driving and even a lack of physical buttons. I get that a lot of people *want* this, for the same reasons most people would prefer an Apple Watch to a Patek, and that‚Äôs fine, but it‚Äôs not what I want as an enthusiast.  
The other reason I couldn‚Äôt connect is it‚Äôs not a very ‚Äúspecial‚Äù car. There‚Äôs no story behind it. ‚ÄúWe needed a mass-market electric car, so we built one‚Äù is a good reason for the car to exist, but it‚Äôs not a *story.* Sometimes a story will come with time: many people look back on their first cars with rose-tinted glasses not because of the cars themselves, but because of the memories made in those cars. But other stories already occurred, or are still unfolding, and when you buy the car now, you‚Äôre buying into that story. It‚Äôs part of the reason BMWs with racing pedigree are so popular. It‚Äôs why people shopping at Whole Foods pay extra to read a blurb about the farmer who provided their locally-sourced organic free-range ethically-killed gluten-free vegan broccoli whereas the shopper at Walmart only buys based on price. In actuality, the two broccolis likely aren‚Äôt all that different from each other, but the Whole Foods one is ‚Äúspecial,‚Äù and that matters on an emotional level. The Model 3 is not a special car.

**Final thoughts:** I think what I‚Äôd like most of all is for another manufacturer to produce a real, actual, viable competitor to the Model 3. Looking at everything available now and even in the next two years, I‚Äôm just not seeing anything. $39.9k gets you a Model 3 with 240 miles of range, acceleration close to that of my MS3, OTA updates, and AP, for better or worse. Every other EV right now is either slower, lower range, more expensive, lacks any sort of AP, lacks OTA, or even several of the above. And the EVs coming out don‚Äôt appear to fare much better: the ones most discussed are more competitive with the Model S (which debuted in 2012!) than the 3, and even there they often fall short at least on paper. And none of them have Tesla‚Äôs two biggest not-so-secret weapons: superchargers and gigafactories. While public chargers exist, superchargers are still a huge advantage due to a) public perception and b) the fact that most public chargers suck. Often they are too expensive, there are too few, they‚Äôre too slow, they‚Äôre full, they‚Äôre blocked, or they‚Äôre broken. Car manufacturers understandably want to just produce the cars and leave the infrastructure up to others, but that‚Äôs a tough sell. Even if you charge at home 99% of the time, the lack of reliable public infrastructure really hurts adoption. I know I personally would not consider a Bolt (the most viable currently-available non-Tesla EV) in part because of it. And of course, the gigafactories are a huge advantage due to the cost savings enabled by vertical integration. I don‚Äôt see Tesla losing either of these advantages any time soon, and other manufacturers will struggle to compete as a result. But I really hope they do, as we really need competition to eliminate the long list of negatives above.

**Conclusion:** I rented this Tesla Model 3 for the purposes of determining, once and for all, whether I want to order one or not. And now, I can honestly say‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm more conflicted than ever. Despite the huge list of glaring negatives above, this car is a fine daily driver. And daily driving is most of what I do‚ÄîI have to actually travel a bit to get to twisties, so I don‚Äôt go frequently, and while I‚Äôd like to go to a track *someday*, I wouldn‚Äôt want to beat my daily up on it anyways. So by that metric, AP + a bit of low-end power should be key to making the best daily in the world, right? And yet, I just can‚Äôt see this being my only car. I suspect I would miss 80% of what I love about cars, and be hot and uncomfortable the rest of the time. But a pillow + aftermarket sunshade + a [headrest mod]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4vIBNx0rBQ) can fix all that, right? And I‚Äôd probably *come* to love the car eventually as I write my own story, surely?? Truth is, I have no idea, and have learned nothing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/c2wd0h/there_arent_a_lot_of_model_3_reviews_from/,hutacars,264843.0,0.9997
TeslaMotors,would buy if,brwwcx,I am going to lose it with this company.,"This has been by far the worst car buying experience ever...I feel like the writing is on the wall and I am making a mistake but I keep ignoring it and pushing forward with the purchase.

&#x200B;

I will try to keep this short.

&#x200B;

Ordered the M3 SR+ on May 16th. Had a purchase price of $42,200 (Car + destination fees + tire fees) that is before taxes. We went with white paint, black interior and aero wheels.  Cool, all set...excited to wait. I sold my Truck and was using the money towards the M3.

&#x200B;

Saturday I am on looking at the existing inventory and see a M3 SR+ that is white with the upgraded rims listed at $42,900. I got excited because that is $700 more than I was paying for the rims I really wanted, I call to the Tesla showroom where I placed my order. Give them the VIN # and they attach the car to my account. I was pretty excited because I was getting an $800 discount and the car was going to be delivered Tuesday. 

&#x200B;

I then go into my account and see that the total of the car was $43,700 not $42,900 as advertised on their existing inventory. I immediately call the showroom back and was told that $43,700 is correct price because there was no price adjustments on the car. After going back and forth I decide to just go in. I go in there with screenshots in had of my account before, what it looks like now and the car attached to my account...Nobody can figure it out or explain why it isn't popping up in my account at $42,900.

&#x200B;

I end up telling them I will not pay $1500 for the rims and to put the other car back on. I was told the account was updated and I should see the change shortly...Sunday goes by, financing changed and all of a sudden I owed -$9,000 then Monday the finance portion corrected itself back to the $43,700 amount and the car still the same.

&#x200B;

Then the calls started happening...3 separate calls trying to set up delivery...I had to explain 3 times the situation. Finally was told they would push the delivery back to Friday and work on the problem. Never heard back... Tuesday, I call the showroom and get everything in the account adjusted. Was told delivery would be Friday (the 24th) with the original car I ordered.

&#x200B;

Look in my account today...notice the downpayment amount was messed up. I called the main number and asked about fixing it, was told to email finance. While on the phone I asked about delivery on Friday, the lady looked and said there was no inventory so I would not be getting a delivery on Friday...she then pushed it back to Tuesday but said she could not guarantee I would get a car then either.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to now..I now have no expected delivery date. I messaged the main person I was dealing with wanting to know my order placed date so I know when my two weeks was up. If they have yesterday (21st) as my order date I am going to lose it...but I of course am not getting any response.

&#x200B;

I am close to pulling my $10k and putting it on a truck. I just feel that if I am spending over $40k on a vehicle the process should be a little smoother and my questions should be answered. The lack of communication between departments and the way things are done with this company are shocking to me.

&#x200B;

Help me not lose it....

TeslaMotors,would buy if,ac9m63,Why the half tax credit is better for a middle income buyer,"So now Tesla has decreased the model 3 price by $2000. The federal tax credit is now 3750. GREAT!

Now people with lower income can get a full tax credit, and 2000 off the car. 

Let me put it like this. 

If you make $55,000 a year, your federal tax burden is $5400. If you had bought a model 3 last year you would have gotten $5400. Less, if you made less. For someone making $45,000 your federal tax burden is 3770. 

So, by buying this year the person making $55,000 gets a Model 3 for $5,750 less, and also pays $160 less in sales tax. Bringing the total to $5,910.

This person saves $510 by buying this year instead of last year.

The person making $45,000 a year Would have saved $3,770 last year, this year they also save $5,910.

The car costs them $2,140 less this year than last year. 

So this is a hidden benefit to the tax credit reduction to a private middle income buyer. 

Personally I am opposed to the tax credit being applied to any car priced over $50,000, or any car not American made.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,e7f2y0,"PSA: New owners, rotate your tires and don‚Äôt floor it so often","Learn from my example. My tread wear is 5/32 on the rears and 8/32 on the front two tires for a Model 3 SR+ RWD (18‚Äù Aero) after 4 months and **11K miles**. For reference, tire replacements are recommended at 4/32 tread, with the legal limit being 2/32. 

On my previous car, I would just get my tires rotated with each oil change (~7K miles), so it came naturally, and the tires lasted until 50K miles. 

With rotation every 5K miles for the Tesla, my wheels probably would‚Äôve lasted to 20K, and since I **didn‚Äôt** rotate until 11K miles, they‚Äôll more likely last to ~15K. 

For those that are unsure where to get your tires rotated (just as I was, which contributed to me putting it off for so long), do not go to Tesla as they quoted me $160. Personally, I went to America‚Äôs Tire, but anywhere will do; you just have to confirm that they‚Äôve rotated Teslas before and have the appropriate hockey puck adapter.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,mjk8vu,3 Months of FSD just expired. How was it?,"Hey everyone! Just wanted to post my experience with FSD while I was able to use the 3 free months, since I picked up my car on December 30th. I just wanted to use this post to document my experiences and figure out if it's something I would consider purchasing in the future. I know many more updates will be pushed as time goes on, but this is just how it was for me for the past 3 months.

Let's begin with the things I pretty much didn't even use, and work up from there. I'll be leaving the standard Autopilot out of this list because every Tesla comes with it. If Autopilot didn't come with the car, I'd be buying FSD all the way just for that alone.

**Auto-Park:**

It sounds very convenient, but I didn't get the option to use it as intended once. What I mean by that, is the only time I ever got the option come up to use it was when there was a sidewalk connected to a driveway, and I was pulled into the driveway. It pretty much thought the sidewalk was a parking spot. It is what it is, but I wish I could've at least seen this feature once. I pulled up to spots to parallel park, spots where there was a gap, even normal parking spots in between two cars, but nothing ever popped up for me to initiate autopark.

**Navigate on Autopilot:**

This one I was particularly excited to try out. Unfortunately though, the first couple experiences I've had with it weren't very good. I drive on highways that don't have a whole lot of people on it, even at their busiest. I think the 2nd time I used it, it initiated the turn signal to get back into the right lane, while I was only a couple feet in front of a semi, which made the semi driver freak out a tad :/ After that, I just didn't feel too comfortable using it to automatically pass cars. It's nice to see what the future holds for fully autonomous driving, but that experience was just a little too crazy for me to try it and rely on it more.

**Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control:**

This is one thing people really liked seeing my car do when I would give them rides. There's not much else to it. The car did a fantastic job on figuring out where to stop and was always reliable.

**Summon:**

Ohhhh Summon. How easy it was to just push a button on my phone and make adjustments to how far forward or back I was. This is one I'll really miss, because I don't actually have an auto garage door opener. This is another feature people got a kick out of.

*EDIT* \- Not sure how I forgot to mention smart summon! Smart summon was a very cool thing to show off, but it really wasn't working as well as I had hoped. It was easier for me to just walk to the car more than anything. The car was always confused if there was something in the way, and never went very fast. I didn't even attempt using it in an actual parking lot for fear of being more in the way of other vehicles. Cool feature, and I hope to see it mature more as software updates pass, but I would never use it for any other reason than just showing off my car driving itself across an empty parking lot.

**Auto-Lane Change:**

Hands down, my favorite feature. It really doesn't take much to change lanes myself, but the fact that all I had to do for the past 3 months was put my turn signal on, and the car would just kind of... do it... absolutely astonishing. My monkey brain is easy to impress.

**Overall:**

Jeez. They really make it hard to NOT want to buy it. Given the price tag of the FSD, and the car already,  I'm not sure. I would love to one day have my car drive itself, but realistically, it already pretty much does everything I need it to. Autopilot handles very nicely on any road with lanes, and does a great job at keeping the distance of the car in front. It's actually saved me a couple times. Really though, if I could find a way to conjure up $10k, I'm in.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/mjk8vu/3_months_of_fsd_just_expired_how_was_it/,binguses,4395.0,0.9963
TeslaMotors,would buy if,25tim3,My negative thoughts after 7k miles in including one long road trip.,"This is coming from someone who still drives ICE cars regularly, drives for a living and over 100k/yr, and is over 6' tall.

My other cars include a 2003 Jeep Wrangler built for off road use, a 2008 smart convertible, a 2011 Chevy Cruze, a 1985 Chevy short bus, and a 1969 project car that I'm not publicly discussing at the moment :)

Overall I love the car but I think it's important to talk about the downsides as well. Listed in no order:

¬∑Even at the lowest seat setting my head touches the roof unless I lean back further than I like

¬∑The app in its current form is pretty lame on both Android and ios

¬∑The range needs to double if I'm going to use it as my main car

¬∑What the hell was Tesla thinking building out the northern cross-country route for chargers before the southern one? The cold weather killed my range, putting me in the yellow zone between SD superchargers, and my car got stuck in the snow at the Cheyenne supercharger last week (video coming soon).

¬∑The software on the center dashboard is buggy. Luckily it can be updated but one time it was on a reset loop, overheated, and slightly warped the silver plastic bezel under the screen. When there's a problem things don't work like gps and Bluetooth, causing potential safety issues.

¬∑I wish it didn't have the panoramic roof.

¬∑It sucks knowing that in a short period of time the car will be significantly inferior to the next version. 

¬∑I'm tired of being an evangelist. You get a lot of questions with the car and I am tired of saying the same spiel over and over. I'm considering printing up a FAQ page to hand out. 

¬∑I wish batteries were leased instead of owned so that battery swapping would be more feasible and I wouldn't have longevity anxiety.

¬∑The software should be more sophisticated. It should give you your rated mileage based on current conditions, terrain variables along your route, and your speed preferences. As it is now it is oftentimes very inaccurate, especially in the cold and when hills/mountains are involved.

¬∑There should be a front facing camera and front/rear DVR with 'black box' capabilities.

¬∑The rear should be able to go completely flat.

¬∑Climate should be on a schedule

¬∑Cruise control should show what exactly it's set at and the 'jump' feature should settle on the 0/5 like on the Mercedes where Tesla gets its cruise system from. It should also be adaptive.

¬∑The latency in the Bluetooth is unacceptable and unfortunately I doubt it's a software problem. I've never had this issue with other cars and I've noticed it on every Model S. It also is unable to see what I'm playing, it just says the name of my phone. The standard KIA headunit on the rental car I currently have shows artist, song title, etc. The other annoyance with Bluetooth is that I have to manually select it every time I get in the car, it should remember what I was last on.

¬∑There should be a local contact person listed for problems at a supercharger that are out of Tesla's control. The hoops I had to jump through in Cheyenne were quite frustrating.

¬∑Open the SDK already!

¬∑The frunk is very annoying to close, especially with snow or rain.

That's all I can think of at the moment. As I said, I still love the MS but there is room for improvement.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/25tim3/my_negative_thoughts_after_7k_miles_in_including/,SethLevy,55087.0,-0.9773
TeslaMotors,would buy if,c22350,Should I return my model 3?,"I just purchased a model 3. I was super excited as I have wanted one for a long time.  I live 2 hours from the nearest dealership so I made the purchase over the phone. I was going to buy new but the sales person told me they had a ""test driven model"" with 170 miles on it that I could get for 500 bucks off and that it was in perfect condition.  So I said sure that sounds fine, whats 170 miles right? 

I get there to pick it up and everything is rushed, some guy comes out shoves some papers in front of me and says ok sign these and here are your keys and walks off.  I haven't even seen the vehicle yet but I am so excited I do it.  I know this is dumb but like I said I was really excited about this car and not thinking straight.  Anyway, eventually I get out to my car and it's beautiful. They tell me they are still printing the tags so that will take a sec and to get to know the car in the meantime and leave me alone in the car.  So I start checking it out.  There is an error with the charge port up on the screen immediately, and the microphone stops working entirely after a few minutes. There are other drivers saved in the car and phones that are paired.  I go find the guy and bring this to his attention and he says ""oh you just need to reboot it no big deal""  and again I do this and I am too excited to care very much.  The errors both go away and I drive the vehicle home. The next day I start getting sensor errors and camera viability errors.  The charging port and mic problem start happening again. 

I reached back out and found out that this car had actually been returned and was not a show model.  I have no idea how to get any of this stuff fixed and my big concern is that there are more problems that I am not aware of.  Am I making a big deal out of nothing here?  Is this stuff easy to get fixed?  Should I care about any of it? It's a two hour drive to the service center and I feel like this is going to become a big problem.  I also don't really trust the folks at this center because of the deception and how they brushed off my concerns and rushed me out the door.   I can't tell if I am being reasonable or just being high maintenance because this is basically the first nice thing I have ever owned.  

Would love to get some perspective on if this is normal and the best ways to resolve this.

Edit, Thanks for input, I guess I will go ahead and return it.  I am not sure if I will get another one.  The experience with the dealer makes me feel like maybe I do not want to commit to a 50k relationship with these people.  Buyer beware anyone picking up a blue LR AWD model 3 in Roswell GA, just in case they turn around and do this again.

Edit again: I called their office to process the return. I did ask to speak to the manager and the sales person told me no and transferred me to the original sales person I had dealt with. They said they don't always know why a vehicle is marked down and that information may not have been communicated well.  That the category is for ""show vehicles, and vehicles that have been returned""  They did not have a replacement vehicle in stock and they did not offer any sort of a discount or other arrangement.  Just ""call ahead before you drop it off"". I have not really encountered anyone there so far that seems to really care about this.   I guess for the people who are saying that I am a plant from big oil or something I guess here is some evidence? http://imgur.com/a/QTlCG0h  I guess if that isn't good enough I can't help you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/c22350/should_i_return_my_model_3/,just_some_random_dud,49274.0,0.9879
TeslaMotors,would buy if,8o7e51,<Discussion> Tesla's history of poor level of build quality has resulted in people being hyper sensitive to any issues now.,"With some of the faults/issues down to an exhaustive checklist to me it seems that Tesla is a has made a rod for its own back now with owners scrutinising their cars far far more than they ever would have with other manufacturers.

Anecdotally for me, having bought two new non Tesla cars in the past, the idea of a checklist is ridiculous but I understand why people are doing it. This isn't a post on the people but I think what Tesla has created is that their already problematic support network is going to get more smashed than ever because people are going in expecting a 100% flawless car when that just isn't very likely even with competitor vehicles.
 
If you look close enough in every nook and cranny of even brand new cars you'll fine problems. They are in the end built from materiel that vary in quality and it's extremely hard to get everything exact 100% of the time.

So in Tesla's pursuit of ""fixing it later"" it might have created a scenario where owners will nitpick even minor minor details and tie up the Service network trying to get it fixed.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,llhpzm,The Journey of My Totaled Tesla Model 3,"This is going to be a bit of a long one, but please bear with me.

I had a 2019 Metallic Blue Long-Range AWD Tesla Model 3 with the upgraded 19"" Sports Wheels and FSD. I bought this car in June 2019, so FSD was only $6k back then and I paid $59,600 total for everything, including the destination fee (from a no sales tax state).

In December 2020, I was hit by an oncoming Jeep on a stretch where the speed limit was 40 MPH, barely into my trip on my way to work. I did not have Autopilot engaged, and I wonder every day if that would've saved me this whole ordeal. 

At first, I didn't know who was responsible since it happened so quickly and I was shaken up. Some kind person stopped shortly after the accident happened and called 911 while making sure everyone was okay. In the meantime, I stayed inside my Tesla the entire time since I was in shock and panicking; I didn't end up speaking to the other drivers involved at all. Police showed up fairly quickly and checked in with all of us, they took my information and gave me the other drivers'. At the time, I declined going to the hospital since I was concerned about outrageous medical bills and still did not know who was at fault. Besides me, the girl who hit me also managed to hit the car behind me. 

[Pictures of totaled Tesla](https://imgur.com/a/4Xh7biX)

I get home and review the Tesla Cam footage. Since the airbags when off, it trigged the recording thankfully. The Jeep was significantly over the yellow line and proceeds to hit me, and I was also able to see a little of the crash behind me despite the camera being dirty -- let this serve as a reminder to always clean your rear camera.

[Tesla Cam footage of accident (front and rear cameras)](https://imgur.com/a/DS478Db)

When we got home, my boyfriend pointed out to me that the driver who hit me was 16 years old, and she had just barely gotten her license. My guess is she was distracted and it seems she had just left her house. 

I decided to file a claim with my insurance, Liberty Mutual, rather than her insurance which is Geico. I had Better Car Replacement coverage, and basically this means they would pay the Actual Cash Value (ACV) of a car with the same specs as mine that is one year newer and 15,000 miles less -- since I only had 10k miles on the car, this worked out for me. A catch that I later found out that caps at 20% more of what the ACV of your actual car is.

Liberty Mutual reached out to me the next business day and asked me to give a recorded statement. I did this and sent them the footage, they told me they would be pursuing subrogation against the at fault driver's insurance. They said they would send out a third party appraiser to check out the damage.

Said appraiser made his way out there a few days later on the 18th, after a huge snow storm hit. He submitted his appraisal the following Monday on 21st. The pictures he uploaded to my claim were covered in snow and you could hardly see the damage at all. He quoted $10k in repairs and it led me to believe that no one so far in this process knew anything about Teslas. 

Next, I was asked where I wanted to bring my car to be fixed. At this point, I believed that my car would be significantly more to fix and believed it to be totaled, and I initially made an appointment with a Tesla Service Center in MA since I'm in NH. They reached out to me and let me know that this would be beyond their scope, and recommended Today's Collision in Malden. 

I called Today's on the 23rd and the guy who answered showed immediate sympathy for my car, and for the first time since the accident, I felt relieved that someone was being empathetic and concern for my car. They immediately said they would send out a tow truck to get my car (that's two hours away!) and I was incredibly impressed with their customer service. I sent them the pictures and after consulting with his manager, he believed the car was indeed totaled but wanted to check out the damage in person.

Car is brought down during Christmas and I have to wait another nerve-wracking few days. I hear back on the 28th, and Liberty Mutual decides to send another third party appraiser to look at it. This also takes a while and after a lack of communication from the third party company, and Liberty Mutual finally decides to send a staff appraiser.

In the meantime, I get in contact with Geico to file a claim with them. I have since gone to my PCP to get a check up since my back and neck are sore, I have brain fog, and I get incredibly anxious being driven around and even don't want to drive now. PCP gives me some painkillers and we decide physical therapy would be a good idea if I continue to have issues, and mental health therapy might be a good idea as well. Geico says they can get me into a rental car, they will cover the medical bills for physical therapy, but they seemed hesitant about the mental health therapy. Still in the process of going to physical therapy now.

It's not until 1/4/21 that I hear my car is finally deemed a total loss, and I hear it from Today's Collision first. I thought this was pretty crazy that my insurance didn't tell me immediately, but I was incredibly grateful to Today's and their dedication to the customer. I was asked some questions by the staff appraiser about the extra options I had on my car to determine the ACV.

Since I was not at fault for this accident, Liberty Mutual reimbursed my $500 deductible and the initial ACV determined was $43,237.50. I did not believe this included all of the options, so I advocated for myself of the options I thought it was missing and they came back with $49,312 after a week or two. Overall, this was pretty good except for the lack of FSD with is now valued at $10k. Ultimately, it turns out Liberty Mutual values FSD at $5,600 due to ""state regulations and industry standards."" Not too bad since I did originally pay $6k for it.

With the Better Car Replacement, the added cost was $3,300. This made my final settlement for just the car come out to be $52,642.50. I also asked if she could reimburse the winter tires that were on the car which added $811.75 and some accessories I had on the car such as the console and handle wraps, as well as the screen protector that came out to be an additional $100 or so. This was all discussed on January 20th, over a month after the accident. 

I owed $37,654.03 left on my loan, so this was paid to my lien holder first. I was paid the remaining $15,478.50 plus the $500 deductible on the 25th. All in all, I made out positively with almost $16k throughout this whole ordeal. I also just canceled my auto insurance policy and got a $1200 refund back, as my policy was $1800 or so for the whole year and I had paid lump sum. I was told the lapse in auto insurance should be fine if I explain to Liberty Mutual that I canceled due to the car being a total loss and not replacing it immediately and should not hike my rates up, but we'll see. 

I thought it would be worth sharing some of these numbers and my experience with my Tesla being totaled, as I wasn't able to find a lot of stories in detail while researching on this sub and others. It's made me paranoid that someone is just going to hit me out of the blue again and I have a fair amount of back pain, but it's really fueled my desire to get another Tesla thanks to how safe I felt and was following the accident. My girl did a wonderful job of protecting me -- RIP Sapphire. For now, I'm actually considering buying a house and using the money towards a downpayment first before getting into another Tesla (which might be a Model Y)! It's just a shame that FSD now costs $10k and can't be transferred. I miss my Tesla very much, please give yours love from me. 

**TL;DR: My Tesla Model 3 was totaled in an accident that I was deemed not at fault. The ACV of my 2019 Blue Model 3 LR AWD with 19"" Sport Wheels and FSD with 10k miles was $49,312. With Liberty Mutual's Better Car Replacement coverage, I was paid $53,632.53 (not including the amount I owed to my lien holder) after over a month of back and forth. Today's Collision in Malden, MA is AMAZING and don't forget to clean your Tesla cameras! Also, take care of yourselves if you get into an accident and get the proper physical and mental care.

I had originally planned to buy the RWD but then after thinking about it I realized that I would have less range anxiety to just step it up to the dual motor AWD. My old car used to go 0-60 in 5.7 so going down to 4.4 was a BIG jump.  
But as I read more and more of other users experiences, a part of me wonders if I should have went with the P model for $6500 more. On the flip side, the price kept creeping up and up and I had already spent a couple thousand more than what I had planned to (+9000). At that point, I would have spent 15K more than what I had originally expected but still, there is a small part of me that wonders if I made the right decision.

Of course at this point theres no chance at all I can swap it out, its been two weeks, I sent in my rebate etc etc. I'm just curious if there are others that **were** in my situation and if that feeling of ""what if"" went away.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/cwr07o/awd_owners_do_you_regret_not_springing_for_the_p/,eatcabbage,528.0,0.24

This didn‚Äôt bother me much, but I felt my wife and kids silently fuming as we made our third recharge stop coming back to make sure we could bridge the 150+ mile gap between Rocky Mount and Chester, VA.  

My wife agrees with me that the S is in no way worth the premium over a similarly ranged 3 and I suspect we will draw the same conclusion when we have to decide between a Y and an X to replace our SUV in a couple of years.   If, however, the S or X had a good 500 mile best case range (and, more importantly a 300 mile worst case range) she would buy-up in a second.  

Has anybody done the math as to whether this is feasible once the S and X are updated with the 3‚Äôs cells?   I realize that will require more than a minor adjustment to the S And X frame, but it seems inevitable.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,v161rs,Tesla Service Center Refuses to Fix Factory Defects,"**tl;dr:** Even though I was promised by the advising and delivery staff that they would fix any problems that came with the car from the factory, the Tesla service center is not cooperative at all, giving pathetic excuses and avoiding all work. Looking back at my Tesla experience so far, it really feels like this is intentionally anti-consumer by design which I will explain with my account below.

I‚Äôm not sure what to do now and would like some advice on what I can do next. Is there any way I can get the service center to actually work on my car? If I decide to return, how do I even do that? I can‚Äôt find anything about a return policy besides a 7-day return policy that was silently removed in 2020.

---

So I just recently got my new Model 3 in northern California, and I‚Äôve never quite had such mixed feelings about a car and its automaker.

Firstly, I‚Äôd like to go over some things that I like since this post will be mostly negative, but I just want to emphasize that I‚Äôm not a Tesla hater‚Ä¶ I mean I did decide to buy one after all. There are so many things about the car and experiences around it that I love, so here are a few highlights:

* The experience in the car and the app takes it all to the next level for me. This car handles better than anything I‚Äôve ever owned. The software it provides is useful and convenient. It does take a bit of time to learn everything that it has to offer, but once you get used to everything, I found that this car is stupid fun to play with. Yeah, there are a few missing features that most gas cars have today that I really miss, but factoring everything together still places this car above its competition for this section.
* This is my first EV, so finally not needing to deal with gas is huge. Dodging the recent gas price hikes has already saved me a ton of money, and my location has plenty of charging stations so I never need to worry about running out of battery. While it does take longer to charge when compared to filling up gas, having lots of entertainment options available makes up for it. Plus, filling up gas takes more time than usual these days if you're going for more affordable gas options like Costco due to higher demand causing much longer lines.
* The shopping experience has been great. I love not having to worry about dealers, and while I understand that there are significant trade-offs in this, I have to admit that just ordering through an app and not worrying about a dealer is so streamlined and convenient. I waited about 3 months to get my car, and that timeline was pretty reasonable for me given my circumstances. I also got a few car accessories from the official Tesla shop, and all the items shipped to my place in just 2 or 3 days. I was also able to return some items that I ended up not needing, and Tesla was quick to refund me promptly which I appreciated.

So now onto the bad things‚Ä¶

## Exploitative Delivery

Let‚Äôs talk about the delivery to start things off. I didn‚Äôt get to choose my delivery day. When time neared the delivery range in the app, it messaged me saying that the next steps were available. I saw the notification but I was busy so I ignored it, and the next day when I actually had time to go through the delivery form, I checked the app and saw that it was already scheduled for me. I shrugged and didn‚Äôt think much of it since the chosen time worked for me anyway, and honestly, I was just happy that I was going to get my car soon.

Delivery day comes and I get a text saying, ‚ÄúYour Model 3 is on its way to \_\_\_\_. You‚Äôll be notified when your car arrives.‚Äù I‚Äôm stoked, and just as I‚Äôm about to do something else, since I assume it will take a few hours to get here, 5 minutes later I get another text saying, ‚ÄúYour Model 3 has arrived at \_\_\_.‚Äù I was quite surprised! It's weird that the text messages came so close together, but who cares! My car is here!

So I walk around outside and I‚Äôm expecting a tow truck to be somewhere, but I eventually find my car in a reserved area that I‚Äôm not allowed to park in, and I see the Tesla delivery staff awkwardly looking down at his phone next to it. I realized that he probably drove the car down from the factory which I was a bit surprised by. It would‚Äôve been nice for it to get towed just so mileage isn't accumulated and that the car is less exposed to the elements as it gets here, but honestly, it‚Äôs not a big deal for me.

I greet him and he immediately starts apologizing about the fact that he didn‚Äôt notify us that the delivery was in progress sooner, and then he takes a microfiber cloth and starts frantically wiping down random dirty spots on the car. I tell him to relax, it didn‚Äôt cross my mind that it was an issue, and then I open up my app to try and get in. It‚Äôs here I realize that my app is still stuck on the ‚Äúdelivery is scheduled‚Äù screen, so I ask if he can unlock the car for me or if he could give me the key cards, but he says no and points out that the key cards are inside the car. The delivery staff‚Äôs Uber ride pulls up and he‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúSorry I have to go.‚Äù I quickly ask what happens if I find defects on the car. He says service will handle it afterward, just contact them. Finally, I ask if he can tell me who to call for help. He shrugs and says he doesn‚Äôt know. Now I‚Äôm left just standing there next to my new illegally parked Model 3 that I can‚Äôt get into.

So while I‚Äôm locked out, I start inspecting the car and find that there are some significant issues with paint, dents, scratches, and misalignments with panels and badges. I don‚Äôt consider myself a car person, but even for a casual person like myself, I find that these defects are extremely noticeable and unacceptable. To put it in perspective, I‚Äôm not going to be overly picky about small things like panel gaps or anything like that. I care more that my car is relatively symmetrical for a casual person‚Äôs expectations, and it‚Äôs pretty far from that when my grandfather can even notice problems.

Eventually, I manage to contact a Tesla advisor who takes a while to unlock my app so I can finally drive. I take some time to find more defects inside the car, and then I request a service appointment as soon as possible to ensure a concrete report of all the defects is documented within 24 hours after the delivery.

In hindsight, I think that all of what happened to me was intentional from Tesla‚Äôs end because I‚Äôm sure that they are aware that some of their cars do have defects from the factory. The key things to point out are:

* By specifying my delivery for me, they forced me to avoid the factory pick-up option. It‚Äôs a lot harder to deny the car when it‚Äôs already driven to your property, and being at the factory makes it easier to deny the car if it is found to be in an unacceptable state.
* The short timeline on delivery alerts is meant to catch customers off guard so the Tesla delivery staff can make it out as fast as possible. The best-case scenario for them is that the delivery staff never even sees the customer. That way it makes it difficult or, ideally for Tesla, impossible for the customer to ask questions, identify factory defects, deny the car, etc. This is probably why my delivery staff was nervous and more concerned about looking at his Uber driver‚Äôs progress on his phone rather than talking to me.
* Tesla service must be heavily booked because it takes a while to get to your service appointment. My hunch is that they‚Äôre probably getting a ton of appointments related to factory defects. The earliest service appointment I could get was 3-4 weeks after my delivery date, and this long wait time benefits Tesla as the longer your ownership is, the more reason Tesla has to say it‚Äôs too late for returns. I can‚Äôt even find anything about Tesla's return policy with its cars. It seems like there used to be a 7-day return policy, but that has since been silently removed in 2020.

## Wrestling with the Service Center

So, even with the issues around delivery, I would honestly be willing to put that all past me if the service center would just follow through with Tesla‚Äôs promise to fix factory defects.

I bring my Model 3 to the service center and proceed to point out the issues to the service staff, and for every one of them, they deflect it somehow so they don‚Äôt need to perform any real work.

For example, on one side of my car, there‚Äôs a severe panel misalignment between the roof rail and the trunk. They told me that the solution is easy, ‚ÄúJust adjust the bump stops at the top corners of the trunk lid.‚Äù They take 20 seconds to do it for me, close the lid, and say, ‚ÄúHey look, isn't it better now?‚Äù And I‚Äôm a bit at a loss for words... It‚Äôs clear that it didn‚Äôt do anything, and there‚Äôs no way it would do anything for this particular misalignment because the panels are offset laterally. The bump stops can only affect the height of the trunk lid.

And this is pretty much how it goes the entire time. There‚Äôs a paint defect, scratch, or dent? They can‚Äôt see it. Can‚Äôt think of any other excuse? This is within spec, nothing is wrong here.

So after we‚Äôve gone through all the problems with no solutions, they want me to leave. I ask to see if we can look at other Model 3‚Äôs to compare to, and the service employee says, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs going to be hard because we don‚Äôt have any other Model 3‚Äôs at the moment.‚Äù I look at the parking lot in front of us without saying anything‚Ä¶ I kid you not there are at least 20 Model 3s out there. He notices me looking and he says, ‚ÄúOkay let‚Äôs see if we can go find one,‚Äù and we start walking.

As we‚Äôre inspecting each Model 3, I‚Äôm pointing out how they have examples of how my car should be. The service employee finally says, ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm starting to see what you mean a bit‚Ä¶ but we can‚Äôt do anything about it.‚Äù

So I‚Äôve scheduled another service appointment that will come up in another few weeks and I‚Äôm not sure what else I can do to get them to fix the car. If it goes unfixed, I don‚Äôt think the car is worth it anymore, so does anyone have any experience with returns and how that goes? I‚Äôm really at a loss here, and any advice or help would be greatly appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/v161rs/tesla_service_center_refuses_to_fix_factory/,emthaw,2516.0,0.9976

TeslaMotors,would buy if,9eiq2k,Why a Tesla is objectively better than an ICE car or other EV.,"**Update**: After reading some comments, I‚Äôm no longer sure a Tesla is objectively better than other EVs. My main reason was that Tesla batteries are superior, but I need to do more current research on that.

I wrote this as a comment to someone asking me why I claimed that Teslas are objectively better than ICE cars and other EV cars. I mostly assume a $35k model 3 for the comparison and the average driver. Each individual driver will subjectively decide if each point is important to them. There‚Äôs no one solution for everyone. The points themselves are the objective measurements.

There‚Äôs a lot that I learned overtime, and it took a lot of research and understanding. I wanted to create this post to help educate new Tesla prospects and also to allow people to know how to help other ICE people ‚Äúget it‚Äù.

Feel free to criticize or add additional points and I will take the feedback and update this list. 

Claiming that something is objectively better needs to make clear what we‚Äôre optimizing for. Road trips vs everyday driving. Routine maintenance vs collision repairs. I would argue that most people on average significantly benefit more from better everyday driving and better routine maintenance.

- **instant torque** is preferable to the average driver.
- **superior traction control** gives you millisecond reaction times, a fraction of what a ICE car can do.  
- **lower center of gravity** increasing handling performance. 
- **regen braking** significantly reduces brake wear. Brakes could last the lifetime of an ICE car.
- **higher elevation** does not degrade performance. 
- **it‚Äôs safer** with a front crumple zone. Crumple zones are much safer than no crumple zones.
- **cold starts** are not an issue unlike ICE cars that can fail to start. 
- **autopilot** Assuming v9 is released and Tesla delivers on what they are promising. Autopilot will be more advanced than any other car. It will pilot highways on-ramp to off-ramp. Tesla‚Äôs are the only cars that claim for such a thing to come to a production car in the near future.
- **full self driving** Assuming FSD will become a reality eventually, and Tesla delivers, you won‚Äôt have to buy a new car to have it. Not other production car claims such a thing.
- **you never have to stop and refuel** For the average driver, assuming they remember to plug in, your car charges every night at home. I don‚Äôt prioritize road trips since they are rare in comparison to everyday driving; on average, the convenience factor of everyday driving far trumps the convenience factor of road trips.
- **no exhaust fumes** can enter your garage or your car (at least not from your own car, especially for hatchbacks when you just start it up)
- **preconditioning** your car in you garage with the garage door closed
- **less maintenance** that‚Äôs also cheaper over the life of the car.
- **exceptional battery that will last a lifetime.** when comparing a [Tesla‚Äôs battery tech ](http://synergyfiles.com/2016/03/tesla-batterypack-optimization/) to other EVs battery tech. This is a huge point. [We have longevity data for Tesla](https://www.google.com/amp/s/electrek.co/2016/11/01/tesla-battery-degradation/amp/), and until data becomes available for competitors, Tesla sits as king. 
- **extensive supercharger network** allowing any cross country trip in the US and getting bigger every day here and in other areas of the world. 
- **a tech car that gets refined and enhanced over time** with over the air updates. The average person prefers over the air updates. Case in point: smart phones.
- **‚Äúfuel‚Äù is significantly cheaper**
- **you can heat or cool the cabin while away** from the car without having to ""run the engine"".
- **you‚Äôre not polluting** the air or the roads with fumes or dripping oils where you drive. [Even if your power comes from coal, you‚Äôre still polluting far less](https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2017/dec/25/how-green-are-electric-cars).
- **option to power your car with solar panels** and home batteries and pay nothing for ‚Äúfuel‚Äù.
- **you‚Äôre combating global warming**

Subjective points:
- **regen braking is amazing**. I‚Äôm a stick guy and it‚Äôs way better than downshifting.
- **you never have to go to a dirty gas station.** Who wants to touch a gas pump handle that‚Äôs been tainted with gasoline and engine oil from people doing whatever to their gas cars while filling up (topping off engine oil, etc), and have gasoline drip on their shoes or car, inhale the fumes, etc. 

Cons:

- **getting access to remote areas can be difficult**
- **battery draining to 0 can be a huge issue**
- **not an SUV**, although that will change once the Y comes out.
- **range is more expensive**
- **you need a place to charge at home**
- **getting repairs done can cost more and take longer to receive parts**
- **for the occasions you need to supercharge, it takes longer 20-30minutes**

There‚Äôs a reason why Tesla owners are fanatical and will never go back to an ICE car again. Above is an attempt to holistically articulate those reasons.

**Update**: this [particular comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9eiq2k/comment/e5pg1gb?st=JLVT7N9A&amp;amp;sh=576e19e4) is great. Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/9eiq2k/why_a_tesla_is_objectively_better_than_an_ice_car/,mjezzi,39409.0,0.9969

I've found a gently used MX in my area and I'm wondering if it makes sense to buy... Typical used 90D price. Background... I'm 27, patent attorney and have been dreaming of getting a Tesla since the roadster came out my senior year of high school.

I have a 2014 Jeep I would trade in and then make a down payment to get to where I'm financing $30k over 5 years. Payments would be around $500. This payment would not reduce the amount I save, either in my 401k or the amount I save from each check.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,caazeg,We might have to remove our Destination Charger setup due to Rideshare driver abuse....,"So a [few years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/5dbupo/nice_thing_to_see_in_the_hall_at_work_today/?st=jxtc00tz&sh=db28586f) we put in some chargers at two locations (Gyms my former boss owns) through the destination charging program.  The locations are about 10 miles apart.  They've worked great, and the gym members with Teslas greatly appreciated them.  Didn't get a ton of use the first year, but since Model 3 came out our area is now flooded with Tesla's and they get used quite a bit.  I should add that the gym owner does not drive a EV, he put them in as a perk for gym members based on my recommendation.

Before the Model 3 era, my (former) boss didn't have any issue when people who weren't members of the gym used them as it was pretty rare, maybe once or twice a week tops.  Usually the people who needed them who weren't members would stop in at the front desk and buy a smoothie or something while they waited, but recently this has changed.

I no longer work for the person who put them in, but still have a membership at his gym.   We're seeing the chargers constantly being used by Model 3 Rideshare drivers waiting for fares.  The owner put up signs saying the chargers are for gym members/customers only, but that has not helped.  The chargers went from being used maybe 20% of the day to now being almost always full, 24 hours a day.   Almost every time he or I show up we have to ask a rideshare driver to leave as they are just freeloading power and blocking spots for paying members.  Members are grumbling that there aren't any spots available to charge.  Several people (including myself) only have gym memberships there because of the chargers.   I mean ""free"" miles while working out is a decent incentive to go to the gym.

Given the location of the chargers in the lots, and the where the sub-panels are that feed them, having someone go out to switch them on and off based on usage isn't really an option, and they are both set up in out of the way areas from the building so even seeing if someone is using them without permission is impossible.

I suggested a timer so at least the setups are powered off outside of gym hours, but the owner is really just thinking about removing them all together.  He's estimating the electricity bill for the chargers has gone from an average of $100/mo to upwards of $600/mo at EACH location.  The hassle of shooing rideshare drivers is just too much for him now.  The other night after hours there was someone plugged in (and not in the car) at midnight.  The security people who patrol the lots from time to time tried to call a tow company (no overnight parking is clearly marked around the lot) but the company wouldn't come as there's no way to remove the charging plug.

Any suggestions for what we can do?  Again, for the occasional random person just driving around this was no big deal but rideshare people are killing our destination setup and my former bosses wallet.  He didn't set these up to pay for another person's business driving.  There's tons of other free chargers in the area, but most of them are J1772's limited to 32amp or lower, our setup is up to 80amps each (48amp for Model 3) so that might be why they use ours as they are more powerful than other free options.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/caazeg/we_might_have_to_remove_our_destination_charger/,-QuestionMark-,67985.0,0.957

I'm pretty much tasked to look into a family vehicle for my wife. I have a CR-V, and my wife has  a 10yr old Chevy Cruze. We have two kids, and I had done as much research as possible and thought of maybe getting a Hyundai Palisade or Kia Telluride. Having three rows could be beneficial for trips or for other family that may want to ride with us. 

Then I thought of getting a Tesla M3-To save on Gas, and we can just my CR-V for trips... I've watched as many videos as I can and the car-seat configuration in a M3 doesn't seem terrible. It will just primarily be for my wife to go back and forth to work, about 45 miles round trip.

I haven't wondered too much previously into Tesla so I'm a bit unfamiliar. -- Is now a good time to buy a Model3? Or should we wait till next year? Any benefits of now vs in a few months? I know the federal tax savings went away two years ago so that's unfortunately out the window(which would have been very nice). 

Any thoughts/opinions resources would be fantastic :)

So it's not going to get you an elevated view like traditional cross overs.

The panoramic roof feels nice from the back, though I'm sure it's not noticeable as a driver since I don't really notice it driving the Model 3. Panoramic view: [https://twitter.com/Tesla/status/1106429722378956801](https://twitter.com/Tesla/status/1106429722378956801)

It basically feels like a Model 3 with a hatchback. If I had to pay $2-3k more to get this one over the model 3? Definitely. Is it anywhere close to the model X? Not by a long shot (I rode in the Model X about 20 minutes after -- Tesla had a Model X shuttle service). The MX is definitely the preferred car but the cost is just too much right now, maybe when prices go down, we'll buy used.

The issue with the model 3 is the limited trunk space. You can't pick up family from the airport with 2 luggage each. The Y solves that. Long term, I'd like to have the X & Y.

Also: I'm hoping Tesla would build a standard skate for bigger vehicles with the pickup, so other companies can build on top of it, like the sprinter, family van, campers, etc.

Please don't.,"As much as my selfish self wants to get in front of you in line please do not cancel your model 3 reservation. The elimination of the tax credit sucks but you buying a gas car in its place would compound the problem. I understand the car is more expensive now and you might have already been stretching for the 28,500 version anyway (35k-7.5+1 for delivery) but the world needs more evs. 

Remember buying the model 3 is more than having a cool car. It's about investing in the future. It's about making the world a better place. It's about supporting tesla, a company who values the future of humanity sometimes even above its own bottom line. So please help us all out, help Elon and tesla, to help accelerate the advent of sustainable transport.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,886iwo,Model 3 info I wish I had before delivery yesterday,"This is very long, but I moved TL;DR tips to the top. Thanks to all the Redditors in this sub who posted such good information that I used to help myself through the process.

**TL;DR Tips:**

* Have electrical needs worked out prior to delivery. I installed NEMA 14-50R receptacles in the places I need them. A full charge takes about 12 hours at 220 volts because the included charger only runs at 32 amps for the extended range model. The quoted charge rate is 30 miles per hour but it will not be linear as the battery gets full. If you have to use a 110 volt outlet, commenter below states a rate of 4 to 7 miles per hour of charging depending on 15 amp or 20 amp circuit availability. It is impractical to charge the car that way for very long.

* Get your financing and insurance research done well in advance because you may have very little notice to pick up your car. Of course you could delay the delivery but who wants to do that! Understand the process your lender requires to fund the loan. Unlike a traditional car dealer that offers contingency financing to bridge small gaps in time between taking delivery and funds arriving, Tesla doesn‚Äôt offer that. You either need to have the money settled in Tesla‚Äôs bank account or have a cashier‚Äôs check in hand to take the car. 

* Don‚Äôt take delivery in Fremont thinking it is the factory. It is a very nice delivery center four miles from the factory but it isn‚Äôt a factory experience. 

* If you want to remove the aero wheel covers, don‚Äôt expect it to look pretty for some time because the parts are unavailable and backordered.

* The car comes with very short USB-C and Lightning cables with right angle connectors that are only used for charging on the upper mat. They said you could buy more cables but I didn‚Äôt seem them readily available. Be prepared to buy additional cables before you leave because nothing seems to be free and the parts departments are terrible.

**My story**

I camped out at the Palo Alto, California Tesla location on El Camino Real and was one of the first 50 people to reserve there. I am not a fanboy but figured I would regret not putting in a reservation later. The original estimate was late 2017, then October to December 2017, then January to March 2018.


On February 1, 2018, my elderly mom was rear ended while stopped for a pedestrian. At about 40 miles per hour, her 2016 Hyundai Elantra didn‚Äôt stand a chance against the large SUV that hit her. Thankfully the pedestrian expected the SUV not to stop and waited. Even though her Elantra was two-thirds of what it used to be, it could drive away while the large SUV required a tow. My mom has the expected injuries from such an accident. The car was totaled and she was paid out four business days later, much faster than we expected which meant we had to scramble for a solution. I let her use my 2014 Ford Fusion Energi plug-in hybrid loaded with collision avoidance to help her from making the same mistake the SUV that hit her did. I borrowed a car and bike from friends to remain mobile.

Shortly thereafter, I got the notice that my reservation window would would be March to June 2018. I considered giving up and canceling my reservation but decided to stay the course. Then I received my invitation to order on February 22, 2018. I placed the order that night and waited.

I ordered a silver extended-range Model 3 with the premium package, enhanced autopilot, and aero wheels to be delivered near the factory in Fremont. Then I waited, and waited, and waited. I checked my order page daily looking for an indication that delivery was coming. On Friday, March 23, I noticed I had a VIN assigned. From what I heard, that meant the vehicle was in production.

On Monday, March 26, I got a call from a strange number in Nevada and almost rejected the call. It was my delivery coordinator to setup an appointment. She offered me Wednesday, March 28 at 5:45 PM to take delivery. That was about 50 hours away. 50 hours to get financing and insurance arranged.

I filled out the Tesla Finance application right after I took the call. The process is opaque much like financing through a car dealer. I have an excellent credit score and was expecting the lowest rate available. First offer was 3.09% for 36 months through Chase with about 10% down. I had been shopping around for rates and found two local credit unions offering 1.99%. I had reached out to both awhile back to understand their process. Tech CU told me that to get the 1.99% rate they advertised, I needed to be referred through Tesla. San Mateo Credit Union offered me 1.99% for 36 months directly with no money down although I discovered that Tesla cannot handle that scenario. More on that later.

I reached back out to Tesla Finance about getting a Tech CU referral. Turns out that in my area, Tesla Finance is only shopping loans to Chase and Tech CU. I received the Tech CU offer through Tesla for 1.99% with around 10% down. Although it would be much easier, I decided to take the San Mateo Credit Union offer because I wanted to finance as much as possible at that low rate.

I ran over to a San Mateo Credit Union branch, fill out the membership paperwork, and open the required accounts. Thankfully I had enough cash on hand, $80, to complete the process. The customer service was fantastic. I got back in touch with the loan department over the phone to complete the process. The Tesla Delivery Coordinator took over on the Tesla side to process the necessary paperwork for the credit union. The credit union‚Äôs process is to overnight a cashier‚Äôs check to the dealership. It was about 3:45 PM on Tuesday and that check had to go out that day to be received in time for the appointment the next day.

The next notice I received was from the loan officer. She missed the UPS cut off. In a moment of panic, I called the loan officer and got her to allow me to pick up the check from her in person. Crisis averted.

Simultaneously, I was working through insurance scenarios. Thankfully I posted to the Tesla subreddit about a month ago regarding insurance. I found that Ameriprise through Costco and GEICO were the two best options for my situation. Ameriprise required additional information for underwriting and several phone calls. I made several phone calls over two days and eventually gave up and purchased a GEICO policy online with almost no hassle. Ameriprise called me today far after their quoted time window to tell me underwriting had not done anything because he forgot to collect my driver‚Äôs license and VIN information.

Picking up a Tesla is like getting a new iPhone on launch day. The buzz is palpable. They let you in the doors and it is posh with a barista, a semi-famous actress giving demonstrations, and lots of lights. You first check in and they note your appearance in their system so they can track you down when your car is ready. I removed my hat which caused them to put in extra work when it was time to see the car.

Once it is your turn, the person detailing your car finds you and takes you into the delivery room. Dozens of cars in lined up with spotlights highlighting the cars in a rather fabulous way, not like a bunch of cars in a parking lot. You inspect the car and note any issues. This car had a few minor panel and window alignment issues that we noted to be corrected by a service center later. She also has you adjust the mirrors and seat then save the settings. It was less instruction than I would have preferred but they were busy.

Next step is working with the person who handles the paperwork. In about 20 minutes, that is all complete and you are escorted to the valet. The valet walks you to the vehicle, hands you the keys and gives you some minor instruction. You try to pull away quickly so you do not get your car dented by the clown in the car next to yours. Total time was about an hour and a half.

Driving home was unusual. Autopilot does not function until after you drive tens of miles. It felt like I was driving a go kart in a video game with the feedback systems and sound broken. You press on the accelerator and the car hauls moves fast. You let off and it slows down very quickly. It felt like a dream state because it was so different than a normal car.

Around the 50 mile mark, autopilot started to function although I do not think it was fully calibrated. Automatic lane changes worked too.

There have only been two area for which I have been disappointed. The aero wheels do not come with the center hub cover, about the size of a quarter, or nice lug nuts. They take something beautiful, the painted wheel, and make it rather ugly by neglecting some minor components. Those components are for sale on the Tesla website for $35 but are completely out of stock online and in all Tesla service centers. They are backordered too. Unfortunately the hubcaps are designed to attach to the center hub hole. If you do put on the $35 cap kit, you have to remove the center caps when you want to replace the hubcaps. Some people drill holes in the caps and another guy used duct tape to pull them off. Neither solution is elegant.


The other gripe is that the included power cable will only charge at 32 amps, not the 48 amps the built-in charger can handle. To get 48-amp charging, you have to spend between $500 and $1000 to either get a Tesla Wall Charger or a high-capacity EV charger. Thus far, I have only found a two EV chargers support that much power. I decided it isn‚Äôt worth paying that much to have it charge 20% faster.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/886iwo/model_3_info_i_wish_i_had_before_delivery/,ssnacks,2048.0,0.9976
TeslaMotors,would buy if,d2cxwe,"Major VW shareholder Wolfgang Porsche rekindles speculation about Tesla takeover. Chief Executive Officer Herbert Diess ""would get in as soon as he could."" The money was there, to get the approval of the major shareholders would be difficult.","So these rumors are making its way in the German media again. Mercedes got off Tesla in the past which is vastly considered as a mistake by now.  

What is your opinion of a potential takeover by Volkswagen?  
I think Tesla could benefit from Volkswagens infrastructure and experience of manufacturing cars. Volkswagen usually let their other brands do what they want. For example, shareholders would have liked it more if Porsche started with an electric SUV, but Porsche, as a sports car manufacturer, wanted to start with a sporty car, hence the Taycan was developed. Which is in line with Porsche's history of building sports cars.   
And if you didn't know, VW also owns brands like Lamborghini, Bugatti, Ducati, and others. Which aren't doing too bad after the Volkswagen takeover. 

here is the DeepL translation of the German sources. If you find English ones, feel free to post them:

>Major VW shareholder rekindles speculation about Tesla takeover



>Tuesday, 10.09.2019, 21:09 CEST  
Considering joining VW at Tesla? Only recently, the Wolfsburg carmaker rejected such speculations. Major shareholder Wolfgang Porsche considers such a step conceivable - if the price is right.

>Volkswagen co-owner Wolfgang Porsche apparently does not rule out a stake in the US electric car manufacturer Tesla after all. ""One must always be allowed to think about everything,"" the 76-year-old said in response to questions from journalists at a VW event on the eve of the IAA motor show in Frankfurt. At the moment, however, Tesla is far too expensive.

>Only in August, Volkswagen had rejected a magazine report according to which CEO Herbert Diess flirts with a participation in the electric car pioneer. Such speculations are irrelevant. The magazine had quoted a high-ranking manager as saying that Diess ""would get in immediately if he could"". The money was there, with the approval of the major shareholders, the Porsche and Pi√´ch families, but it was difficult.


>High price for Tesla should be problem  
A banker close to VW had said that Diess would like to have access to Tesla's software expertise, but that it would be impossible to justify leafing through 30 billion dollars (27 billion euros) for the entire company.

>At the IAA, Volkswagen presents the battery-powered ID.3 to a wide audience for the first time. Over the next few years, the Group intends to become the market leader in electric cars.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,q9krbl,An in-depth review of the Unplugged Performance Model Y luxury coilovers,"I have seen a lot of posts asking about the [Unplugged Performance luxury coilovers](https://unpluggedperformance.com/product/tesla-model-y-luxury-coilover-suspension-kit/) and how much of a difference they make, the cost to install, whether it‚Äôs worth it, etc. I have had these for a while now and I think I can shed some light on all of this for whoever is interested to help you figure out if it‚Äôs worth it for you. I‚Äôm happy to answer any questions that I can.

I‚Äôll split this up into categories so it‚Äôs easier for everyone to find the answers they are seeking. Unplugged Performance did ask if I planned to post something somewhere about my experience, but they didn‚Äôt offer anything for it and don‚Äôt know my opinion, so this is 100% unbiased and I won‚Äôt gain or lose anything by posting it.

I have a 2021 Model Y LR in black, with the Gemini wheels. It‚Äôs been two months since we had the coilovers installed, and I‚Äôve driven about 5000 miles on them in that time.

Here we go!

**Why I decided to order**

I saw some reviews before we decided to buy the MY that said the suspension was quite stiff. It seemed like a pretty common theme. This is a problem in my family because my wife gets bad headaches in cars that are really stiff like that. We test drove a MY and we loved it, but she anticipated that she might get headaches on long drives, plus we both agreed that it was unpleasantly stiff in comparison to our 2020 Subaru Forester Touring, which has a super smooth ride.

**Ordering Process**

The process to order the coilovers is not super pleasant, at least it wasn‚Äôt when I was doing it. They are VERY backordered, and even the long estimate I got was optimistic. I contacted UP via their website in mid-March 2021 after I had decided to order my Model Y. They let me know that the lead time for the coilovers was 8-12 weeks, and that I could secure my place in the queue by paying 50% of the price, which I decided to do. That amounted to $**1,272.50**. This was done via Paypal invoice, so the process is somewhat ad hoc. If I weren‚Äôt as tech-savvy, it would‚Äôve seemed a little sketchy.

Ultimately, 8-12 weeks was pretty far off. I didn‚Äôt actually receive them until July 27 (my birthday!), which was about 17 weeks of waiting in total. They arrive in a medium-size box that includes everything necessary for install (sans tools).

**Cost**

All told, the cost to me was:

* $2,495 for the coilovers
* $1,725 for installation
* = $4,220

**Installation**

This is the most location-dependent part of the process, as UP has a list of pre-approved install shops. I live in Seattle, and there‚Äôs only one approved installer here, so I‚Äôm guessing this is not a massive list. That said, from what I‚Äôve heard, if you have a shop that specializes in Teslas AND can do suspensions, it‚Äôs probably not going to be a problem for them. UP is communicative about this so I think they would have suggestions about how to find shops that would be able to handle an install if they didn‚Äôt have an approved installer near your location.

For me, the install happened at [Cantrell Motorsports](https://cantrellmotorsport.com/) in Bellevue, WA. They specialize in European auto repair, specifically Porsches. Teslas are really not listed at all, but they do this specific installation from time to time.

I brought the car and the box to their shop. From watching videos others had posted about these, I knew I wanted the settings to be fairly soft, so I asked for them to be at about 25%. There are 32 degrees of softness (1 is softest, 32 is hardest). Mine ended up at 8. I also had heard that the coilovers allow you to lower the car, but I didn‚Äôt want to do that, so I asked for them to keep it as close to the original height as possible.

Installation took a couple of days. I went to pick up the car and they walked me through how to adjust the settings. They also gave me the old coils. They had assumed I was installing coilovers to stiffen the suspension, so they were surprised that I had asked for them to be softened instead. The tech said they thought that was weird until they saw the coils that came out of the MY. The guy said they were HUGE, rivaling the ones he had on his 4Runner. He was confused about why Tesla had put such enormous coils in.

The car ended up about a half-inch lower than it was with the previous coils - hardly noticeable.

**Adjustment**

After driving for a day or two, I decided I wanted to soften things a bit further, so I attempted to adjust the knobs. The front knobs are dead-easy to adjust. You just open the hood and pop off the vent panel at the top (super easy). The knobs poke up through there and you just twist them a bit to adjust. There is a distinguishable click between each setting. The only annoying thing is that there‚Äôs no way to tell what setting it‚Äôs currently at besides going fully one way or the other, then counting the clicks. Additionally, there‚Äôs no indication of which direction is which for softness/hardness on the dial, but fortunately it‚Äôs left-loosey-righty-tighty. I decided to set it down to 5, instead of 8.

Adjusting the back knobs was much more difficult than I expected. The knobs are located inside the wheel well of both back wheels, at the 1 o‚Äôclock position. I had heard that a person with small arms might be able to reach the knob. This is probably true, but you really would need small arms. I had no chance of reaching my hand back there. I tried using a tool to reach it, which kind of worked, but I couldn‚Äôt feel the clicks as it turned. Ultimately, I decided that I needed to jack the car up to reach it, but I didn‚Äôt have a jack.

Due to the height of the car, and the fact that it‚Äôs even lower than before, I bought a low-profile hydraulic jack. It is not necessary to remove the wheel to make the adjustment. As you raise the car, the space between the top of the tire and the top of the wheel well increases. I raised it a few inches and that was enough to slide my hand in there. Spoiler alert, that‚Äôs a terrifying feeling knowing that a failing jack will break your arm. I recommend jack stands for this reason, though I did not use them.

**How does it feel?**

This was what made me the most nervous - the reviews I had seen seemed to indicate that there was a noticeable, pleasant difference between the OEM suspension and the coilovers, but it‚Äôs extremely anecdotal. It was very hard for me to tell if the difference would be sufficient.

Fortunately, I can say that it is. The suspension feels much more like our Forester than it did with the OEM suspension. Bumps are much less jarring. With the OEM suspension, you feel every bump instantly and fully. The coilovers soften them and spread that force out over time so it‚Äôs not like falling off a cliff, it‚Äôs more like sliding down the side. It‚Äôs very hard to explain, and I suspect this will be the most disappointing part of the review to most people wondering if they should buy these.

I think I can confidently tell you that if you‚Äôre noticing your Model Y‚Äôs suspension all the time, and you feel like it‚Äôs really stiff and bumpy, you would probably really enjoy the coilovers. I used to notice that all the time, and now I never think about it. It is especially noticeable with potholes, cobblestone, train tracks, and roads that have a lot of repairs or flaws in them. Going over those with the OEM suspension was teeth-chatteringly rough, and that‚Äôs drastically improved by the coilovers.

If you‚Äôre hoping they will make you glide over rough roads and you won‚Äôt feel bumps anymore, or something like that, you shouldn‚Äôt buy them. They aren‚Äôt a magic bullet that makes your car smooth as butter, but they will definitely take the edge off of bumpy roads. UP claims the coilovers make the MY suspension feel like similarly priced luxury vehicles, and I agree with that claim. Having driven and ridden in similar vehicles, I think the change here makes the MY feel like it *should* feel at its price point.

Also, if you never notice your suspension as it is, you probably won‚Äôt get a lot out of this. It‚Äôs super adjustable, and if you like the way your car drives now, I doubt you‚Äôd find enough value for the cost to justify buying this.

Interestingly, my father-in-law immediately noticed the difference, having ridden in the car with the OEM suspension weeks earlier. It was one of the first things he said when he rode in it after the coilovers were installed, before I had told him about them.

**Comparison to reducing air pressure in tires**

I have the Gemini wheels, and there have been rumblings that the Gemini wheels allow for the softest ride, and that you can soften that further by reducing air pressure to around 38-39 PSI. I do not recommend this. While I was waiting for the coilovers to arrive, I tried this, and I don‚Äôt think it made any difference to the ride feel at all. I think it‚Äôs absolutely a placebo effect.

If anything, it was a detriment, because the reduced air pressure results in higher friction and higher surface area for road contact, which will just degrade your tires faster. I drove around like this for a couple weeks to help my wife‚Äôs headaches while we waited for the coilovers, and when I put the tires back to their original PSI, she didn‚Äôt notice at all.

If you‚Äôre thinking you‚Äôll just reduce your air pressure instead of buying these, I really don‚Äôt recommend it at all.

**Other notes**

Some people have worried about whether an installation like this voids the warranty, and there are dissenting opinions about that. After doing research, I concluded (like others have) that this work voids the warranty on any suspension-related issues your car may have, but not other unrelated things.

Also, if you lower your car, it could impact the ability of Tesla mobile service to do things like tire rotations and fixes. This is something to note if you plan to lower it more than I did. Mine is only a half-inch lower, and when I had a tech come out to swap a flat tire, he said he noticed the clearance on the jack was less than he was used to and he was initially worried it wouldn‚Äôt fit.

**Conclusion**

I would definitely make this purchase again. It solved the thing that most annoyed me about driving this car. Really, the only thing that bothers me about this whole thing is that the MY should come from the factory with a suspension like this. It‚Äôs silly to have to make this kind of fundamental modification.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,am9ipc,"I just took a 2000 mile+ Road trip, and I don't think they are ready to release the SR","**Edit: Please don't downvote me into oblivion! This isn't meant to be negative, more of a jumping off point for discussion.**

&#x200B;

I will preface this by saying that like most in here I love Tesla. I love the company, the car, etc. I remember seeing my first tesla right when the model s came out and knowing I HAD to have one at some point. I was a sight unseen day 1 reservation and have been absolutely thrilled with my car. I just got back from a long road trip and while my thoughts on the car itself have not changed (as amazing as day 1, and life changing for road trips), the supercharge network is another story.

&#x200B;

I realize in it's own right it is an amazing feat, and nobody else is near what they've accomplished, but they want tesla to be main stream, accessible to many with the SR and the supercharger network in its current state just isn't going to cut it.

&#x200B;

The largest issue at hand is the range itself in real world use. I have the MR and there were certain stops I pulled into with around 5 miles left, and that was with going 15 mph UNDER the speed limit for stretches of that. Some of these had stops in between where I could have charged, but some did not. Also, it was cold and I know how that affects the battery, but the fact still remains had it been a little colder (which is entirely possible), I would not have made it. And if I was in a SR I would not have made some of these legs in the current conditions. I know they always have plans to add stations, and it's no small task, but it needs to happen or else you won't be able to get everywhere in an SR. Also, I can't imagine it looks great to have your vehicle limping along in the right lane getting passed by semis and everything else because you have to keep it at 55 in a 70 to make it between SC.

&#x200B;

The lines are of concern, though most SC I hit had space, only a few were ever full at any time while I was there, but it did happen multiple times along the way. I've seen this concern expressed before but this is the least of my concerns at this point.

&#x200B;

Speeds - There were plenty of times that I plugged in and nearly hit 500 mph charging which was awesome. However, there were also a few times where I was getting around 60-70. Some stops I need to grab food but many stops I don't, and this is simply not going to work. Not sure why, and it didn't matter which stall I went to, but that turns a stop that should take 30 minutes into a mutliple hour ordeal if you want to make it to your next SC.

&#x200B;

I knew what I was signing up for, as is the case for many of us who have followed tesla forever. My concern though is that if they release the SR to the masses many people won't know what they are getting into. If Tesla wants to be a serious contender they have to seriously contend. To replace the ""car"" they have to be able to replace the car. If people can't take these on a road trip without knowing for sure that they can make it to the next charger, or that they won't need to stop for 1.5 hours to charge at a slow SC that will present a problem, and I think the masses will make a lot of noise.

&#x200B;

I made my trip and had a blast. A few thousand miles and I loved using EAP, and didn't mind having to stop every couple hours to charge, broke it up nicely. However, these issues definitely stood out to me. I love this car and I want tesla to succeed so badly, and just worry  that with the supercharger network in it's current state the SR rollout could be a nightmare

&#x200B;

EDIT: To say that I realize not everyone is taking super long road trips. This is not something I do often either. But most people do drive away for a weekend here or there and my concerns apply just the same in those scenarios over certain stretches.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/am9ipc/i_just_took_a_2000_mile_road_trip_and_i_dont/,thetvirus,4036.0,0.9856

* I ordered the ""HEPA"" filter and got scared with all the ""Your AC will die!"" talk so I ordered original Tesla filters. Seeing as I had both in hand... why not test them out?
* After 16,800mi it was time for a change. HVAC system gym sock smell was on point. The car also spent a few weeks in smoke from forest fires. The stock filters did NOT block the smoke smell from entering.

**PROCEDURE:**

* I tested airflow at the drivers side vent. Both vents were on during this test.
* I tested air flow with the original filter before removing it and performing an evaporator cleaning.
* I then tested No-Filter, Clean Tesla Filter, and finally the [XTechnor](https://www.amazon.com/XTechnor-Filter-Activated-Conditional-Replacement/dp/B085HX67ZX) ""HEPA"" filter.

**RESULTS:**

* The left chart is the raw data. The right chart indicates the change in air flow between the filters.
* To my surprise, the dirty vs new Tesla filter had NO difference in air velocity. Maybe mine wasn't dirty enough? Or does the computer compensate for this?
* Having no filter installed saw an increase in air velocity by an average of 1MPH at each fan speed.
* The ""HEPA"" filter actually had increased air velocity up until fan speed 7. Air velocity was lower for the ""HEPA"" filter at fan speed 9 and 10.

**CONCERNING VARIABLES:**

* My XTechnor filter has ""carbon"" pellets that only cover 50% of the surface. I've seen other people post pictures of ""HEPA"" filters that have carbon beads that cover 100% of the surface. I was unable to test those filters.
* I believe they started adding 100% carbon pellet coverage to the filters after I purchased mine. This means my flow rate data is not accurate for all ""HEPA"" filters and full coverage filters likely have reduced airflow.
* I did not test other brands of filters, HEPA or not.
* I could not test the effectiveness of the filters when it comes to blocking particles. I did buy a particle detector but the outside air was too clean.

**PICS OR IT DIDN'T HAPPEN:**

Ok, fine. Be that way.

**CONCLUSIONS:**

* I personally don't think these ""HEPA"" filters do anything. Just look at how thin the white filter material is on the ""HEPA"" filter compared to the Stock filters. This would mean the carbon pellets have to do a lot of heavy lifting, which I don't think they can do because physics, even if 100% full of carbon.
* I've heard some people in the reviews say their ""HEPA"" filters let in more smells than the stock one, especially truck exhaust and fast food smells. This seems common for HEPA filters as gasses are much smaller than particles. If the ""HEPA"" part is actually effective, you have to decide if odor is something you can deal with. The activated carbon is supposed to remove odors but it clearly doesn't do this... because physics.
* The fact that the ""HEPA"" filter allows for increased air flow also has me worried about its ability to clean the air of particulates. My understanding is that a thicker HEPA filter is more effective and thus air flow is reduced unless the fan is upgraded to compensate. My fan was not upgraded, so it seems clear this filter isn't stellar. Look at a Dyson HEPA filter and the difference is staggering.
* The foam surrounding the ""HEPA"" filter seems like a point that air can get through without the proper filtration. Sure, the foam may compress a bit, but does it do it enough to prevent particles from getting through? I'm not so sure.
* **Would Tesla have had to design a HUGE HEPA filter system in the 2022 Model Y's if they could have just made their existing filters HEPA filters? This fact alone seems like a nail in the coffin for these Amazon ""HEPA"" filters.**
* My gut instinct is telling me that the Tesla stock filters are better (I don't have the filtration data to know if they actually are). I'm guessing the Amazon ""HEPA"" filters are just marketing non-sense to get you to buy them. Legitimate HEPA filters seem to be quite a bit more expensive as well.
* Good news at least seems to be that these ""HEPA"" filters will not damage the AC system due to restricting air flow, as some were worried about. Real HEPA filters absolutely would restrict the airflow and that could damage the HVAC system.
* I want to try this again during fire season and use a particle detector to see if there is a difference.
* If you have the same Anemometer as me and you have the new Model Y with Bioweapon defense mode, get some readings for me and I'll add them to my list for fun.

**GRAND FINALE:** These filters are B.S. don't buy them. A true HEPA filter in the same square footage would result in a huge reduction in air velocity and thus require an upgraded fan motor or risk burning out the existing one. My tests show an INCREASE in air velocity which is the opposite effect from a true HEPA filter.  

I hope you all enjoyed this information! I'm not a specialist in this area so I apologize for the uneducated bits. Feel free to teach me!

I did a bunch of filming of the test but it's honestly boring. If you want me to try to edit it all together and throw it on Youtube, let me know, and if enough people want it, I'll do it.

I would love all of your opinions, especially if you're an engineer or expert in this subject. What could I do better next time?",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/u5bj9h/tesla_model_3y_cabin_air_filter_air_flow_rate_a/,KyleDuffyVO,119.0,0.9986
TeslaMotors,would buy if,91dde4,Unpopular Opinion: I Test drove the 3 today and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to click order.,"Knowing the Model 3 demo cars were getting sent out to the showrooms, I began to do some realistic car shopping. 

So, last weekend, I test drove cars that I have been looking at in the similar, or nearby, price point (without tax credit, there‚Äôs still no guarantee I can get delivery by Dec 31st): BMW M3 (used), BMW M340i, Merc CLA 45 AMG, Audi S3. All fine cars with their own pros and cons.

Then today, I finally got to test out the model 3. The model they had in our particular location was a RWD long range with aero wheels. Acceleration was good, but not great. Ride quality was pretty good for a 4100 lbs car. Steering response was pretty good too with the steering setup for sport rather than comfort. Range anxiety was quelled when I got to use the navigation system in the car that could help route to superchargers taking into account a lot of factors (testing out searching the longe range holiday routes I take every year), and even suggesting a mph to drive to get to a destination without stopping. Braking performance was good, considering how little grip the tires that come with it have. 

!WARNING! PERSONAL OPINION AHEAD!

The deal breaker was the awful interior. For a car as expensive as it is, I felt the interior was severely compromised. Mind you, they call these first year builds the ‚Äúpremium black‚Äù interior. There is a saying that you can buy the ugliest house in the neighborhood because you don‚Äôt have to look at it yourself. What you do have to look at everyday is the interior!

For me, considering I am looking for at least an entry level luxury vehicle at this price point, I want a steering wheel with quality materials wrapped around it as well as comfortable fitting seats and an interesting dashboard. What I got in the Model 3 was a squishy steering wheel wrapped in the same power washable pleather that the seats come in. When sitting in the car in the showroom I didn‚Äôt seem to mind how the dash was laid out with the central touch screen being a catch-all for every control the vehicle offers. In practice, though, after driving with it for 30ish minutes I just couldn‚Äôt get over the lack of driver interface with actual, tactile, buttons. It‚Äôs also quite strange having to use peripheral vision to see your speed, much like you get in a Mini Cooper. 

What I wish for, and hopefully Tesla can provide a vehicle I can fully love, is a driver focused interface much like the Model S has. If the Model S gauge cluster and dash was in the Model 3 I would have ordered 2 years ago, instead I‚Äôm questioning why I have put $1000 in a 0% savings account at Elon Bank.

I understand the car is designed with Autopilot as the main feature, which is why there is absolutely no driver controls built anywhere near the driver‚Äôs seat, but I guess it isn‚Äôt just for me. Feel free to try and change my mind (or not, one less person out of the order pool).

TL;DR, car drives fine, even in the lamest configuration, but lacks a lot of character interaction on the inside.

EDIT: I get it, the wheel is actually made of leather. The moral of the story is that it doesn‚Äôt feel good to me, regardless of its material. And to those telling me the interior shouldn‚Äôt hold me back also missed my house analogy. Considering you spend 100% of your time driving the car inside of it I think it‚Äôs almost more important than how the car looks from the outside.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,aldv9m,Tesla in the Vortex: my experiences with my Model 3 in extreme cold and snow,"Short of it: I live in Toronto. We were hit with extreme temperatures this past week. On Monday night, we got bombarded by snow, to the tune of probably one to two feet. Then today, our temperatures dropped to -28C (-18F for my fellow yankees out there). 

I've had a Model 3 RWD since September, so this is my first winter with the car. I keep it outdoors at all times - I park it in the driveway between my house and my neighbour's, and I use the portable charger that came with the car to keep it juiced up overnight.

I have to report that, to this point, the car has handled the adverse weather conditions just fine. Here's a brief breakdown on some specifics:

**Range**

I can't say that I've been paying much attention to efficiency during this weather. I typically keep the car charged overnight and start my day with 440km of range. However, I did not plug the car in last night, and between driving (5KM to work and back, and a few other places local to home that probably put my total driving range to around 30KM since the last charge) and my battery has dropped from 440km to around 280. I don't really consider this concerning, nor is it representing the actual range of the car were I to climb in and simply drive it to the States or somewhere. I suspect that if I got it on the highway, the Actual Range would be similar to the trip I took to NY at Christmas time - about 350km (220-230 miles) for a full charge. I wouldn't be shocked it it was closer to 200 miles, but it would still be efficient enough that I wouldn't stress.

**Handling**

I fortunately have winter tires. I say fortunate, as my street has basically transformed into a one lane slush street. There have been times when I've had to drive the car into a foot or so of slushy snow, and I have been frequently impressed by the car's ability to push through it. The only time I found myself at all stuck was driving uphill on a *very* snowy street, when I had to drive off the ""track"" to allow another car to pass. It took a bit of rocking, but I was able to get the car out of the snow and back onto the road.

The only thing I don't love about driving in the snowy cold like this is related to the wipers. I find that they tend to freeze quickly and are very streaky. It's also easy to jam up the area above the hood where the wipers are located, so it's hard to shoot out the antifreeze onto the windshield in that situation. I might look into buying heated wipers and having them installed.

**Heat**

I know some people have voiced complaints, or concerns, with how the cabin heats up. I find the car warms up *quite* a bit. I tend to keep my interior at around 22 or 23 Celsius, with the fan on at a 2 to a 4 level, and I honestly have to turn down the fan (or the temperature) at times. Only during the coldest moments, when the snow was really falling, did the car feel cold, forcing me to crank the defrost settings in the cabin.  If you are having trouble with your heating in the car, it might be a car issue, and you should talk to someone in service about it.

**Charging**

As mentioned earlier, I keep the car outdoors and charge with the portable charger. Due to the conditions, on a handful of occasions the charge part hasn't closed properly, and snow has gotten into the actual charge area. Snow has also gotten into the tip of the plug. However, it has yet to freeze. If it does, I'm kind of screwed, because we don't own a hair dryer. However, in the two days when the charger itself has gotten a bit snowy, I've just brought it into the house in order to make sure that it properly thaws/dries out. I plan to charge the car tonight, and have no worries about the port freezing. To be fair, I tend to ""condition"" the car for a good 30-60 minutes before I drive it in the morning, as I fire up the heater and sometimes extend my max capacity from 80 to 90% to ensure the battery is warm once I'm on the road.

**License Plate**

In Ontario, we are legally obligated to have license plates at the front and back of the car. To accomplish this, Tesla apoxies the front plate to the car. As I was trying to wipe snow/ice off my car yesterday, my front plate detached and fell to the ground.

On the surface, I find that *relieving.* I was nervous that they'd actually drilled into my car to install the license plate. However, I risk a $200 fine by not having it repaired. So if you are living in stormy, cold conditions, be aware that your front plate could fall off. 

**TL;DR**

The car has done a good job in the bad weather. So far I've felt safe on the roads, I'm not worried about charge loss, the cabin is cozy, and the issues are minimal. This is basically as extreme as extreme weather gets in Toronto, apart from the occasional freezing rain (which would make any car a nightmare to access), and the car has handled it perfectly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/aldv9m/tesla_in_the_vortex_my_experiences_with_my_model/,Haquistadore,87424.0,0.9914
TeslaMotors,would buy if,dhu3g9,Gifting my mom a Model X,"Hey Tesla Fans!

So my mom really wants a Model X, but is trying to retire soon and doesn‚Äôt want the debt of buying a new car. She currently has an (2016/17 not sure the year) Audi Q7, but she always says the car she buys will be a Tesla. I would love to buy her an X because I know it‚Äôs her dream car and want her to have the same joy that I get everyday from my 3. I just have a few questions about gifting a Tesla. Here are some of the prerequisites:

1. I can afford it and would insure she had no additional debt. Would also pay off the car at purchase so no loan needed. 

2. I would like it to be a surprise if possible

3. She would trade in her Audi

My questions are:

1. Are there any taxes associated with a gift like this (guessing yes, I live in TN if that helps)?

2. How can I buy the car and have it delivered to her and have everything in her name?

3. How can I have her car valued for trade in secretly?

4. Can I use my own referral code too get it for her?

5. Any good tips of getting her feed back on some of the design without her knowing? (Mainly color and interior feature wise I know what she wants)

6. Is there anything else that I‚Äôm currently not considering?

Thanks in advance for the help!

The inventory model was more expensive then the new 75 build I wanted and didn't have the air suspension and new faster drive unit. I'm probably going to wait till the first reviews and unbiased comparisons come out before making a decision now.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,8u90wk,"If not for tesla, I would have not bought a new car.","

I just ordered my Model 3 LR-D. I have been waiting for model 3 for 2+ years and decided to buy a used Honda Accord in the interim. I had gotten used to the Accord over the last years so it feels if not for Tesla I would have not bought a new car.

The full history. 5 years back, I bought a $54k new BMW 3 series. I had to sell the car within 1.5 years as I had (temporarily) moved to an urban area around NYC, where parking was very expensive and the car was hardly useful. The selling price for 1.5 yr old and very gently used car was $32k. I was burning to have lost $22k for a little used car and decided to never buy a new car. Fast forward, we decided to move to the suburbs, hence needing a car. Around then Model 3 was announced and I jumped on it first day. But in the interim bought a used Accord. Now that tesla was ready to order I became conflicted partly because of the BMW experience and partly because I liked Accord (a sweet no frill ICE car). Anyway, I got over the doubts as I thought buying Tesla is not a choice between new vs old or regular vs premium but a lifestyle choice... a choice to free up from using gas and about embracing future.

The model S has been my dream car, and with the model 3 finally being released, I can finally say that in the next few years when I am ready to buy a new car, it'll finally be a Tesla.

However a good friend of mine cautioned me against it.

He says that much of Tesla's success is due to the fact that they have no *serious* competition.  Sure GM / Ford / BMW etc all have hybrids, and there are are a few fully electric cars out there, but they are all using old technology and none offer (that I know of) self driving.

He thinks that if any of the existing big automakers were to really go fully into electric and self driving, that they could release a car with better build quality, cheaper, and with more range, safety features, and most importantly, the backing of a large company for warranty support, dealer support, parts inventory, etc.

I really doubt they Tesla would just disappear overnight, but he does bring up a good point.

[Model 3 in a smoked out Yosemite shortly after Sunrise](https://preview.redd.it/0qt8d1nth1c11.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c78244d4ffce758ad26d51040cf5e396200c613)

**PREFACE** **->** I‚Äôve been a long time car Enthusiast. Had a few performance turbo imports over the years (Eclipse/Talon and Lancer Evolution) along with working at a high performance Import 4G63 shop that made big power cars. I have a good sense on what is ‚Äòfast‚Äô, and cars that are ‚Äòdrivers cars‚Äô as well.

So far I have been on a big road trip across the US with my newly acquired Model 3. I‚Äôve just hit 10,200 miles, in just over 2 months of ownership, and have now driven on all types of roads, in various locations all over the US. Most of which I had never personally been to or seen before prior to this trip! Here are my thoughts on the car so far.

**OVERALL ->** Love the car. Can‚Äôt tell people this enough when they ask me about it. On May 21st, I picked up the car in Mt. Kisco NY, and drove it 5 hours to my home in Upstate NY. Drove it around town for about two weeks and then proceeded to take a \~2 month road trip out west across the US, visiting as many National Parks and cool locations as I could! Here are some of my thoughts..

**AUTOPILOT ->** Can‚Äôt live without it. As many others have said, it really makes monotonous driving pretty awesome, and way less stressful / fatigued. I keep my hand on the wheel, and I‚Äôve found a good position to have constant pressure on the wheel so I rarely get the nagging notifications. I can keep my Left arm/elbow rested on the door arm rest, while I have my hand holding at about the 9 o‚Äôclock position where the center spoke meets the outer portion of the wheel. Since Autopilot is always moving the wheel a minute(my-nute) amount keeping the car centered in the lane (even on perfectly straight roads) this is enough pressure where it can tell I am holding the wheel. Works great for long highway drives. Especially the drives in the mid country and out west in the US. Autopilot has handled about 95% of the roads I‚Äôve tried it on. Including some back roads with crappy markings, twisty roads, during intense rain falls etc. I have to actively remind myself to not get complacent as it does inspire a lot of confidence when using it.

**INTERIOR ->** I LOVE the seats. I have never once found myself uncomfortable or cramped/sore when getting out of the car after a long-ish drive. I‚Äôve basically spent about 2 months on the road and it feels like I‚Äôm sitting on my favorite couch or chair‚Ä¶.everyday.As most others have also mentioned, having some cooled/ventilated seats would be nice. I do try and precool the car when I can, but I enjoy hiking, and alot of the National Parks don‚Äôt have any cell reception(so precooling isn‚Äôt possible). Most of the time I wait outside the car when I arrive back half soaked in sweat, and let the car get cold before I get in. Still takes awhile for my hot back to be fully cooled though when in the car. Not a deal breaker by any means, but in the future if Tesla could design and make a good ventilated seat, it would be a nice feature to have eventually! ( I know they tried before and it sucked, hoping they continue trying to make it work).The center console cubby storage is awesome. The big front compartment with the lid right below where you have cell phones sitting, is great for easy access to snacks and food while driving. The glass all around, and low dash create a very 'open' feeling being inside the car. I love it.Sound System is AMAZING. I can't recall hearing another one that has been better, and it brings me lots of joy listening to my favorite music while driving to all sorts of awesome new locales.

**DASH / Center Screen ->** I don‚Äôt honestly get most of the hate by reviewers on this subject. After about 1 hour of driving back from Mt. Kisco I was used to the center screen, and actually prefer it for a few reasons. Once you get your settings set in the car, you rarely have to do anything on it. I usually Bluetooth my music, and can navigate through songs via the scroll wheel/buttons. Same with volume.Climate control, put on Auto,(but I even use on Manual without an issue since it is large and easy to access). Autopilot is easy to control as well via the scroll wheel and stalk. Wipers you can quickly turn on via the button on stalk, and it automatically pulls up the wiper speed screen on the dash for quick adjustments IF Auto wiper speed isn‚Äôt working good for you(only twice on this trip have I had to change speeds because Auto wasn‚Äôt cutting it. Rest of the time Auto was working fine).¬† ¬† ¬† My biggest LOVE for the center screen, is NOT having anything directly in front of me. This allows the dash to be lower which allows for much better visibility (It also increases the already awesome ‚Äòspacious‚Äô and ‚Äòopenness‚Äô feeling you get inside the car). It is also better IMO at night, not having anything bright directly in front of you. Allows my crappy eyes to have better night visibility and watch for any Deer or other creatures that want to wander in front of me.The minimalist interior allows you to do everything you frequently do(Autopilot, cruise speeds, music) quickly and easily, and only takes a minor amount of effort to do things you might occasionally have to do.Bottom line -> It is very OPEN feeling with the glass roof and high frontal visibility of lower dash so I never feel claustrophobic on long drives. Easy access to things you constantly use, and not having a front dash screen is better at night IMO.

**EXTERIOR ->** I love the looks of the car. Side profile IMO is the best. Visibility using the rear view mirror isn‚Äôt BAD. Not the best due to high rear trunk, but not horrible. Can always use the backup camera at anytime if you need extra visibility. Side mirrors work great with how I have them setup. Door handles are second nature to me as I've used them on GTRs before. No issues there, and seems like a good move reliability wise and cost effectiveness IMO.

**DRIVING ->** I liken the Model 3, to the Lancer Evolution of the EV world, and that is a HUGE compliment. The Evo was DRIVERS car, but also made for a decent daily driver as well.The Evo handled like a go-kart, provided great feedback in corners, good steering ratio, and always put a smile on your face anytime you accelerated, whether in a straight line or some nice canyon carving bends. In my Journey across the US, I have been on many highways, back roads, canyon roads and I get the same exact feeling tossing, turning, and accelerating in the Model 3. While not as nimble as an Evo 8/9, for an EV it is about as close as you can get. The Model 3 has a much more luxurious/quieter/comfy interior though. Makes for a more refined and relaxing daily driver that can be fun when you want it.

**STORAGE ->** The car has plenty of room for me. The trunk holds my twin memory foam mattress topper,  tent, sleeping bag, blanket, water bottles, my suitcase of clothes, and a few bags of crap. I also have the lower compartment of the trunk stuffed with extra necessities and emergency goods.

**RANGE/ Distance ->** In my driving thus far, I have driven mountain roads, highways, back-roads, small town roads, dirt roads, and any other roads you can think of. From 30\* temps, to 118\* in Death Valley. Car has pretty averaged around 250Wh/mi, which usually means you get the exact range the car is showing. I‚Äôve only had to go out of my way once in fear of range anxiety, and that is because it was 38\*-44\* outside Yellowstone one night, and range was dropping faster than anticipated/normal. I went about 15 minutes out of my way to stop at an additional supercharger, and spent 15 minutes supercharging to ensure I would make it to my destination without issue. That is a testament to the Model 3's range, along with the supercharger network build out. The National parks can have quite long roads into them, and superchargers can be quite far away outside of the parks. The fact I have only had one minor out-of-route stop is stupidly impressive IMO.I have really been 'winging it' a lot on this trip. I had a rough plan of which parks were where, so I would pick one and go to it. Spend a day or two there, and then when I wanted to leave, just plug the next destination into car navigation. Let it figure out a route and I would then find sleeping accommodations(most of the time booking these while at the superchargers). No set dates for anything on my trip, and nothing booked out more than Two days before I went to said location.The LR Model 3, and high range Model S‚Äôs are probably the only EVs you can do what I‚Äôve been doing within any reasonable time frame and minimal planning. A Bolt would be a disaster trying to cover this distance in these remote areas with any reasonable charge times and locations. The Base model 3 would/will have a hard time in some locations as well. They would spend abit more time at superchargers since the LR Model 3 gets a lot more mileage gain in the 20-80% ‚Äòquick charge‚Äô range, than the base Model 3 will. Something to consider. If you are going to be road tripping a lot to somewhat remote locations, you will NEED the LR battery pack IMO. The 220base range would be quite difficult doing some of the routes I‚Äôve done so far and you would have a ton more range anxiety, and charging time.Sure it is definitely do-able in lower range EVs, but will require a lot more pre-planning, and pre-booking of hotels/lodges/camping with destination charging. I am more of a ""I'm going to go here today"" kind of guy, and getting lodging or camping inside National Parks in summer season without prebooking is pretty much impossible. So luckily the Model 3s range, along with supercharger network has allowed me to pretty much do everything on a whim without issues.

**PROBLEMS ->** A few days before my trip, while my car was at a shop getting 3M PPF wrapped on the front end, they called me to let me know the Frunk stopped popping. They had previously wrapped a Model 3 before, so they knew how the car worked. They hit the button on dash, it would make noise, but frunk wouldn‚Äôt pop up. We called Tesla, I tried a few things, they tried a few things, and it wouldn‚Äôt pop. They thought the motor might be bad. Tesla said they would order part, and let me know when it arrives. Rep was nice and said it would probably/honestly be about 2-3 weeks since they have never actually had to order this part before. I told them I was going on a road trip and didn‚Äôt want to delay it, so order the part and I will call them when I‚Äôm back. I tried frunk for shits-n-giggles about 1 week into my trip and it popped up like normal. I saw a wash bucket I had in there was moved forward abit, so I‚Äôm ASSuming(I have no clue really, but this is my best guess) maybe the wash bucket got moved forward when company was wrapping my car. When they closed it the bucket was too far forward, pressing up on frunk since it was kind of a tall bucket. This may have been putting to much pressure upwards on the frunk and the latch for the motor might not have been able to un-latch the frunk. After abit of my driving on road trip, plus many heat cycles from varying climates, maybe it moved and or contracted enough to where it wasn‚Äôt too much pressure pushing upwards on the frunk? I‚Äôve no idea. All I know, about 1 week into my trip, I tried the frunk and it popped just fine. I moved the wash bucked to back of frunk so it wasn‚Äôt touching, put some of my other crap in there, and it hasn‚Äôt had an issue since.About 6 weeks into my trip I did get a ‚ÄúTraction Control disabled - Contact Tesla Service‚Äù error along with ‚ÄúAEB disabled‚Äù and I also noticed Regenerative braking stopped working as well. I called Tesla and was talking to a service rep within 10 minutes. He(just by my phone number) knew who I was, and asked if I was calling about the Model 3 on my account. I said ‚ÄúYes‚Äù and then he told me he could see my car was showing those error messages before I even had time to say anything. He walked me through the process of POWERING OFF the car fully, which we did. Car started back up about 2 minutes later, and errors were gone and everything was back to normal! Just a sensor being annoying and needing a reboot!

No other issues to report. My VIN # is 163xx and the car has been flawless minus the two hiccups listed above. Fit and finish upon pickup was perfect, along with interior as well. Car is super quiet, comfortable, and SOLID.

**TLDR**

* Love the car.
* The 'Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution' of the EV world but with the comforts of higher end luxury cars.
* Minimalist Interior is perfect IMO. Does everything you need easily, without overcrowding. Comfy as hell seats.
* ‚ÄòSpacious‚Äô interior/roof never leaves me feeling claustrophobic.
* Exterior is pretty sexy, especially the full side profile which is the best angle of this car IMO. ( example -> photo at top of this page)
* VIN # 163xx has been SOLID so far since pickup.

I made a website to blog/update my road trip adventures. I'm like 8-10 National Parks behind right now, so I have alot to add thus far. (there are no ads or anything on the site. I did it purely to inform people of my journey, and because I love this car) . I'm also not a blogger or writer by trade. I'm just typing out my thoughts online, spell checking, and posting for the most part.

I have some updates to my trip so far, and I'm working on adding maps of my routes, along with the superchargers I stopped at. Pictures and information etc. Its not super easy to do being on road, and sometimes cell reception / internet is crappy. Or I'm just really tired and fall asleep once I get to my hotel or camp lol. I should be adding abit more here soon. Currently headed back towards home, and I will have alot more time to add and revise things.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,8s0k30,My weekend in a rented Model 3. My review and why it's not for me.,"I‚Äôm a day-one reservation holder in LA and I‚Äôve had my invitation to configure for a few weeks. I spent the weekend in a rented model 3. 

We‚Äôve all read the reviews and I just wanted to add my two cents and suggest everyone go rent a model 3 before you buy one. I found it to be a far, far cry from the model S on so many levels. When I talked to the owner and told him I questioned whether the model 3 was comparable to other $50k cars. He told me straight up, it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs a $35k car with some bells and whistles. After this weekend I‚Äôd compare the insides to a fancy Honda Civic. It may look nice but you can feel where they skimped. 

My current car is a V6 Acura TLX. Quick, fun to drive, kinda sporty in a Honda accord kind of way (lease payment $431 w $1000 down). Before that I leased a Mercedes E350 (the best car I have leased) payment was $535 w $1000 down. 

I found the model 3 suspension to be on par with my TLX in most cases.  At freeway speed, on Los Angeles bumpy-ass freeways, there was a couple oh-shit moments as the Model 3 felt like it was too stiff for the conditions. Very unforgiving. 

WTF is up with the baby seats and baby steering wheel? I hadn‚Äôt read anything about this but the steering wheel is so small even my 70 year old aunt asked about its size. The front seats are also small. I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô8‚Äù and found the bottom seat portion was considerably smaller than a traditional seat, both in width and depth. I didn‚Äôt really find the comfortable seat position in my 48 hour test drive. My 7 and 10 year old kids also complained about the comfort in the back and that it was too bumpy. 

I thought Autopilot would make my LA commutes bearable. Granted I know there may be some tricks of the trade but I hated the way the autopilot would speed up quickly when traffic flow opened up. This would inevitably be followed by heavy breaking because this is LA and there‚Äôs always traffic. (I also began to wonder if autopilot controls the break lights or just uses regenerative breaking? Does the person following me know what I am doing?) I tried setting the cruise to a speed commiserate with the flow of traffic (40mph) and the hurry up and brake tendency was reduced but then I found myself constantly adjusting the speed with the wheel. (I might as well just take over).  At speed in ‚Äúnormal‚Äù traffic it was great but didn‚Äôt strike me as a $5000 value. ($83/month for 60 mos).

I got used to the screen and didn‚Äôt find looking right an issue but found that too many of the controls were buried. On a couple occasions I pulled over to find out how to turn the bass down and once to search for a local radio station since everything programmed was either talk radio or bubble gum artists. 

I am also a live-and-die leaser. I do not see the benefit of borrowing money in order to pay a higher monthly payment vs leasing the same vehicle. The value of owning doesn‚Äôt show it‚Äôs face until year 6 and by then I will have moved on. I also get a tax benefit by leasing. Like the above mentioned lease payments I can rent a nicer car for ~$500/month and spend $175/month on fuel vs the $800-$1000 for 60 mos that the model 3 would run.  If this was about the environment or  daily-driver-commuter car I could lease a chevy bolt for ~$350 with $1000 down. 

I also asked my wife if we would travel with the model 3 and the answer was no. It‚Äôs not big enough nor comfortable enough to compensate for the fuel savings.  

Just my two cents. I‚Äôm out. Everyone just moved up in line. And I will never lease/buy a car again without renting one and spending an entire day with it.

I am currently not a Tesla owner but am a believer and investor in the company.  Although I don't own a Tesla car yet, I would be interested in claiming a stake in Tesla's FSD software package for $10K.

Tesla should consider allowing non Tesla owners to buy the FSD license at today's prices.  Here me out.   If someone could pre-purchased a license for future use.  An individual could use it one day with their new Tesla or any new car assuming Tesla licenses FSD to other car manufacturers to allow mass adoption.  

And an individual should be able to own the their copy for the license and it should follow the person not the car.  It should move with an individual from car to car (with a small transfer fee, of course).  

Why buy it early?

I believe the price whether through inflation or value will drive prices up very quickly.  Also Tesla has the option to go to a Subscription only model which is also profitable so I understand why.  

Obviously Tesla is light years ahead with their FSD.  

Either way I cannot wait to have a self driving car and would be willing to invest now for something that will be definitely in my future.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,6210wy,Seriously considering Tesla for my first car when I graduate this May and would help figuring out if this is even remotely practical.,"So I know this sounds completely insane, and it kinda is, but hear me out. I'm graduating college soon and need a car to get to my job. I've never owned a car, partially because I'm visually disabled and driving is somewhat difficult / dangerous for me, but also because as a college student I've never needed or really had money or time or space for one. But, for better or worse, the job I have lined up after I graduate requires a car to get there, so I need to figure something out. Simple as that. 

I'm in love with Tesla, and as someone who is visually disabled and grew up completely dependent on others driving me around, the prospect of a car that can (in time) drive itself is the closest thing to a miracle I could ever ask for. The only problem is, as we all know, these things are expensive and I'm not sure what I should do. Right now it seems like a Model S is my only option (obviously a Model 3 would be ideal but those won't be remotely ready in May haha). I'm totally down with a CPO in theory, but for obvious reasons the AP 2.0 is a must for me, so that severely limits my options since I'm not aware of many used AP 2.0 cars for sale. 

My current plan is to lease a Model S 60D (I'm in the northeast area so 4WD is a big deal for me) with FSD capability, but I'm a total car noob so if there's a reason I should do loans instead or a way for me to easily get a AP 2.0 used / floor model / whatever else you think would fit I'm all ears for suggestions.

So yeah, let me know how stupid I am / if you have suggestions on how I can at least make it less stupid.

Refund posted to my card within 12 hours of making the request in app. Only regret is not buying $2k of TSLA on Friday instead of the boost :)

I decided to buy the AWD boost on Friday night and give it a go for the weekend. Seems there are a lot of questions floating around as to how the process works, so I thought I'd share my experience.

TL;DR Do it if you want to try it. Seems like Tesla thought this through and put in the work to automate as much as possible in order to minimize contact rates. Screenshots [here](https://imgur.com/a/a1ywUKC).

**Purchase**

Friday night, I purchased it in app using Apple Pay. Modal in-app says I have 48 hours to request refund. Apple Card was charged immediately, and the transaction cleared the following day. *Side note: I have no idea how anyone butt purchases this. I tapped Purchase, which loaded another webkit view where I had to tap Purchase again, and then I had to auth with Face ID.*

After purchase, the boost shows up in the purchased tab of the upgrades page, and there are links to view my invoice and request a refund. I go into my garage, and sport mode is on my car. Of course I go for a drive.

**Experience**

<48h time lapse>Lots of driving and smiles on my face. Boost is significant after about 35mph but very minimal from a stop. Would like to see same level of violence from 0mph as I did from 35+. Picked up a buddy with a non-boosted AWD and took him for a ride. He wasn't impressed from a dig, but he laughed like a girl from a roll.</48h time lapse>

**Refund**

Tonight I got home from a Super Bowl party (go Chiefs) and requested the refund. There are three options along with a comments box. I filled it out and had to double confirm to request the refund. The confirmation notification said I will receive a refund within 3-5 business days, and within minutes the boost was removed from my car (drive modes back to standard and chill). So far no activity on my Apple Card.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,jor4pj,Tesla frustrations (Range/FSD/Cost/Leasing/Trust/Fear of Missing Out),"Sorry for the wall of text.

A brief background: I consider myself to be an ""average"" consumer, with an interest in tech/electric cars.

I started dabbling into electric cars with a Chevy Volt back in 2016.  This was a way for me to get ""50 miles of range"" with a gas backup.  This was great commuter car, though I questioned the quality of the gasoline backup engine. After leasing for 3 years, I had something like 70% of my driving was all electric.

I waffled back and forth about going ""all electric"" and finally pulled the trigger on a leased Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus.  I didn't know if I was going to be happy being 100% electric, as I no longer had the gasoline backup, which is why I wanted to lease.  They just came out with the $399 deal too, but I settled for a lesser upfront down-payment and sitting around $475/mo.

Overall, it's been a good experience, but there are some frustrations I have with the car/tesla in general.  I am on the fence about whether my next car will be a Tesla or not. More about this later.

Frustration #1: Average Car efficiency vs stated range:

The 2019 Standard range plus is rated for 240 miles.  A HUGE justification for me going all electric with Tesla is the supercharger network.  I also opted for the standard range variant because 240 miles in any given direction there was a supercharger.  From the Tesla Supercharger in Little Rock to the Supercharger in Memphis is 163 miles. 240 should be plenty.  The temperature for this particular drive was 50F average.  I went from 98% SOC to 14% SOC.

[https://imgur.com/a/JOAWvSk](https://imgur.com/a/JOAWvSk)  (min distance per drive 1mile)

There's nothing new here that people don't already know, but given any drive, you're only looking on average about 75-80% efficiency.  Winter city driving can be as low as 60% (and it doesn't get below freezing here.)  The reason this is important, is that you're supposed to keep the car between 90% and 10%.  The 240 range, is now 192 (10% off the top and bottom).  Add to that a wintertime efficiency of 60%, that's 115mi of range before needing a recharge. My daily commute is 20mi (10mi each way) x 5 days a week.  When I first got the car, I was charging 100% off the public infrastructure, and to be honest it was a hassle.  I had to charge on Sunday for my work week (40 mins), and Charge on Friday (40 mins) for the weekend.  The 240V chargepoint chargers work ""ok"" at a rate of about 10% SoC per hour.  If someone else plugs into the same charger while charging it's about 5% per hour.  All that being said, it was such a hassle that I ended up renting out a garage for $100/mo just so I can do daily charging. \[I live in an apartment.\]

Frustration #2:  ""Planned Superchargers""

Even though that Memphis trip was a bit of a stretch, when I bought the car it said there was a planned opening half way between Little Rock and Memphis in Forrest City.  ""Target opening 2019"" at the time.  Same with the one opening in Arkadelphia.  ""Oh well this range anxiety thing will be a non-issue once those open up later this year.""  Except they never opened.  They changed the target date to ""opening in 2020.""  I fully suspect come 2021 that will be the new target.  I know they will eventually come, but a huge let down of me expecting them to come at the advertised time.  I recently drove from Dallas to Little Rock and started out with a 95% charge, and then it got COLD outside (like 50-55F).  My defroster/heater came on and we were going to run out of battery before we got to Little Rock.  I told my wife that we have to drive without heat to make it back, and use the defroster sparingly.  We made it back with 9%. Since winter weather is just starting here, I will likely have to take my wife's ICE car next time we go.

Frustration #3:  Autopilot (included)

Before I purchased my M3, I saw videos of people \[wrecklessly\] putting on makeup while driving, and things like this:

[https://www.thedrive.com/news/36366/morons-leave-driver-seat-empty-let-tesla-autopilot-drive-so-they-can-keep-drinking-in-the-car](https://www.thedrive.com/news/36366/morons-leave-driver-seat-empty-let-tesla-autopilot-drive-so-they-can-keep-drinking-in-the-car)

I knew going in that this was not normal and extremely dangerous.  I knew going in that it was a ""driver assist"" L2 system and required 100% attention at all times.  I tapered my expectations WAY back, and decided I would be happy if it helped with interstate driving \[it does.\] Even after I purchased, people would ask me if ""is that the car that drives itself?"" I assumed it was at least a very capable system, if people are /that/ wreckless with it, then when used properly it should be a fantastic driver assist feature.

Except it's not (wasn't?).  When I first got the car, I would have horrific problems with phantom breaking on the interstate (usually involving overpasses and shadows.)  While I still used it on my daily commute, I eventually learned that I had to ""baby sit"" autopilot, just in case it decides to randomly brake.  It didn't make my commute less stressful, just now when someone pulls up close to my rear, I have to make sure to rest my foot on the accelerator in case it wants to brake.

After owning it for a bit and using Autopilot, I had to tell people that it most certainly doesn't even come close to being able to drive itself.  I even tell people that it can actually be dangerous, due to the phantom braking issues I've encountered.

To be fair, with the continual updates, it's gotten a lot better, but I still have to baby sit it when people drive too close.  I think it's a good system, and on long road trips it's a godsend for fatigue.   I do not trust it (nor should anyone for any L2-L4 assist system).  Word of note, even though I like it, it does not pass the wife test.  She yells at me for using it because it makes her feel unsafe.  I do not use it when we are riding together.

Frustration #4:  Full-Self-Driving package (add on:) / Can't buy-out Lease.

I'm leasing my car, so any add on packages are lost when the car is returned to Tesla.  Tesla also stated that there is no buying out the car at end of lease. The reason for this was because they were going to be rolling out the Robo-taxi service.  So I can't buy the FSD package, and then buy the car out later either.  I know supposedly they are going to come out with a subscription plan for lessees, and that's a decent stop gap.

The problem: After driving the Model 3 for a little over a year now, the price of the FSD package keeps going up.  It's something I want to buy, but didn't because I'm leasing.  I'm leasing because I didn't know if going all electric was for me.  I've got 2 years left on my lease, and I've been seriously thinking about purchasing Tesla as my next car.  Which kind of brings me to the very last frustration is that if FSD keeps going up over the next two years -- that owning a Tesla suddenly becomes ""not worth the price / hassle"".  Delaying the purchase of FSD just makes it more expensive so it's a zero-win game when trying to balance a budget.

All being said for me to get the product that I actually want, would be looking at the Model Y, Long range w/ FSD.  That's a $60,000 dollar car.  And FSD will go up in price before my lease is up.  The standard ranges aren't enough in my experience (outlined above), and I'm getting shafted on the FSD price going up because I leased due to uncertainty w/ all electric.

At the end of the day, I think the rising cost of the FSD package will end up being what drives me away from Tesla.  All the other hassles I'd be okay with living with, and even stretching my budget so I can get the Long range model, adding the cost of a rising FSD package is the straw that's making me consider to just go back to driving an ICE car.

There's an old saying ""The juice isn't worth the squeeze"" - well I think it was worth it.  The standard range plus is a good car.  But by the time my lease is over and I'm ready to buy, I'm guessing the price of the ""car I want"" will be too much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/jor4pj/tesla_frustrations_rangefsdcostleasingtrustfear/,netnem,1169.0,0.955

TeslaMotors,would buy if,5fj1e9,Model 3: After Sale ownership costs are key,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am posting because I want to see if there are other Model 3 reservation holders and Tesla fans that prefer cars that require as little maintenance as possible and make it as easy as possible. I seem to constantly see people speculating (and requesting) in this forum about what other new and exciting features ( hey HUD !) that the Model 3 will have and it is somewhat concerning. Not to mention seeming ever expanding feature creep in from Musk‚Äôs twitter feed.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To do this Tesla needs to prove out the long harped on, ‚Äúwith fewer moving parts electric cars should be cheaper and easier to maintain‚Äù. Unfortunately the cars they have made so far have simply been too complicated in features and design to prove this out from everything I have seen from this forum and from publications like consumer reports. In order to get there I think they need to focus heavily on:

1. Execution: As has been mentioned these cars need come out of the factory with none of the typical fit and functional issues Tesla‚Äôs have had in the past 
2. Maintenance costs: These cars need to finally prove that electric provides owners with dramatically lowered maintenance costs. Fewer moving parts should mean fewer time consuming (or expensive if you prefer to pay so much for your car/maintenance that you get a ‚Äúfree‚Äù rental) trips to the shop. 
3. Simplicity and ease of maintenance and parts availability: As Tesla scales it is not practical for them to continue essentially forcing all maintenance of their vehicles to go through them (particularly at the high price they charge)  
These vehicles should be designed so that they are easy enough to jack up and work on for the standard easy to perform parts of maintenance (brakes, bearings, suspension, battery coolant, brake fluid, cabin air filter and blower, headlights) that owners and small independent shops can do it themselves. These items are not difficult to do yourself with even a small working knowledge of cars, as long as the car is designed to make such things not unduly complicated (I am looking at you german cars!). Things that are designed with maintenance in mind, and making it easier and cheaper to perform are simply better.
Finally parts availability, in order to make the above practical Tesla needs to work hard on making parts available and using common parts. Suspensions and brakes are not special, make it so I can get new parts at autozone please. The rumored wait times and restrictions on purchasing parts only through Tesla stores in person I have seen here on the forms are ridiculous and not practical.
 - * Example: yay Tesla is making their very own special glass and making it all one piece on the Model 3. Me: really?!! What happens when you get your windshield cracked by a rock by a truck in a different lane as has happened to me three times and you have to replace it because your state says that a crack in the windshield, even on the passenger side and only a few inches is illegal and ticket-able. Is Tesla going to be the only place to go? How ridiculously expensive is it going to be to get a new one of these preposterous monstrosities?  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I currently drive and have been doing much of the maintenance on Ford Ranger 2.3l 2wd xl. While not a particularly inspiring car one thing I have come to appreciate how reliable it has been and how cheap and easy it has been to repair and maintain. In occasionally touching other vehicles I have always come away amazed at how much harder manufactures manage to make things to do that are simple on the Ranger. I am not sure if the Ranger was purposefully designed to be easy to understand and maintain but it is, I have been able to do all the things I have mentioned and more with no outside help or education beyond the internet using a fairly small number of tools (often faster than it would be if I spent the time to drive to a shop and have them do it). This strikes me as a huge accomplishment of design for maintenance rather than anything I have done, and it something I plan to look for in future vehicles.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I understand getting excited about new technology, I am as well, the only reason I personally am considering buying a new car vs used is the self driving/enhanced autopilot features, but I believe all such dreams (with the exception of self-driving/enhanced autopilot and increased range) should be curbed on a mass market car in favor of the one of the biggest things Tesla has struggled with, long term ownership costs(in time, hassle and money).  This is still a very expensive car, the capital opportunity costs are huge, please deliver something that isn't going to simply continue to drain wallets (as I am afraid after warranty the Model S and particularly the Model X will do) after purchase.  
Model 3 dislikes:

+ Flappy recessed door handles. Why?! These cannot possibly reduce drag that much. They are unnecessarily complicated, difficult looking to use, and likely less reliable (just like the motorized ones on S).
+ Really large contiguous glass windshield. Already discussed, why?!! Going to cost sooo much to replace
+ HUD, why?! These have historically had higher failure rates and problems which is why they are not standard in pretty much any car. 
+ Center LCD on stalk.  Why?! This is going to break off; in crashes, when kids are rowdy. Just make it a drop in recessed block in dash...

TL;DR: Tesla should focus on quality issues and total cost of ownership, particularly maintenance from a labor and parts availability perspective with the Model 3. This most likely should be done by focusing more on simplistic functionality rather than flashy features.   

Edit: Note, I failed to mention this originally, but I love Elon Musk and his goals with Tesla and SpaceX. I think the cars are awesome, self driving/autopilot and its safety implications I think are the biggest new thing to come onto the car market in a long time, most new car features are gimmicks but these are truly revolutionary and they seem to have a great plan.  

Edit: This has been a bit of a rough thread but I have learned a few interesting tidbits:

+ Windshield is not one piece, but three, better. WAG of $1500 to fix, still way to high IMO (BMW MINI is ~$300 with BMW labor)  
+ screen stalk is apparently very sturdy so this may not be an issue. willing to take this on faith.  
+ have yet to convinced handles are practical/offer anything but oooh cool   
+ HUD still such pie in the sky that anything is just speculation. Personally, hope its just an option or is dropped to focus on production.    
+ Maintenance, most seem to agree at least that this something Tesla is different about. Slightly more concern for them opening up repair/parts to independent shops/owners, but still not on the radar for most contributors to this discussion.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, little bit of a rough crowd, forced me to have a think about Tesla's likely attitude if this forum represents its average owners unconcern for the issues of ontime, reliable, maintainable cars, they may not care either. I will drop res if it becomes clear that is the case, or I get impatient waiting for the issues to be cleared up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/5fj1e9/model_3_after_sale_ownership_costs_are_key/,dustfromdust,340.0,0.9931

TeslaMotors,would buy if,ja4j0n,My thoughts on Autopilot and whether you should pay for Full Self Driving,"Hey guys,

I made a post last week covering every dollar I‚Äôve spent on my Model 3 over the past two years. One of the biggest expenses was the purchase of Enhanced Autopilot and that got me thinking about the value of autopilot and Tesla‚Äôs decision to eliminate the Enhanced Autopilot option for new customers.

So, I‚Äôm making this post to share my thoughts on Autopilot features and whether it‚Äôs worth paying $8,000 for Full Self Driving (FSD).

For those who are considering buying a Tesla, here are the two options available to you.

1. Stick with included Autopilot that enables your car to steer, accelerate and brake automatically within its lane
2. Pay $8,000 for FSD, which includes
   1. Autopilot
   2. Automatic Lane Changes
   3. Navigate on Autopilot
   4. Autopark
   5. Summon & Smart Summon
   6. Traffic light and stop sign control
   7. Autosteer on city streets (not yet available) 

For those who haven‚Äôt heard of Enhanced Autopilot (EAP), it‚Äôs an option Tesla offered in the past that included everything FSD has except for traffic light detection. Tesla brought back EAP last month for a limited time for some owners and we are not sure how often they‚Äôll bring this option back in the future.

Here‚Äôs my experience with all the features in Enhanced Autopilot. 

## Autopilot 

Almost 95% of my highway driving over the past couple years has been on Autopilot. This is Tesla‚Äôs most polished feature and it‚Äôs improved a lot over the past year. There‚Äôs still the occasional hiccup here and there and I‚Äôve experienced braking while going through underpasses in new areas sometimes. Autopilot was the main reason why I purchased EAP and now that it‚Äôs included for free, it makes the decision of spending $8,000 for the other features a bit challenging.

## Automatic Lane Changes

A feature I didn‚Äôt expect to use as much as I ended up doing is automatic lane changes. It is super convenient to engage a turn signal to change lanes. In my experience, it works very well in areas where there are a lot of Tesla cars, but I had some challenges using it in remote areas. It might be because Tesla hasn‚Äôt received enough driving data? It would be amazing if Tesla included it in Autopilot for free, but I think they realize the value it adds to the overall package.

## Summon & Smart Summon

I‚Äôve rarely used Summon over the past years. It has been convenient to use Summon to take the car out of my garage, but it has failed to work half the time while waking the car from sleep. Also, Summon doesn‚Äôt work if you try to move your car on a slope. So, if your driveway is on an incline, you‚Äôll have to drive your car into your garage. It works fine when you reverse on a slope though. 

Smart Summon has been my favourite party trick. It‚Äôs still super slow and I absolutely don‚Äôt trust it enough to use in crowded areas, but when it works, it feels like we‚Äôre living in the future. One main issue with Smart Summon is that it doesn‚Äôt respect the direction of traffic. So, if you summon your car in a parking lot, it won‚Äôt go stay on the right (Canada). [Here‚Äôs a demonstration](https://youtu.be/l8kKKBm3WEQ). 

## Navigate on Autopilot

For long stretches, Navigate on Autopilot has served me quite well! My main issue with this feature has been its tendency to stay in the passing lane for long periods, but the most recent update seems to have added the option to prevent it from doing so. Also, in some cases, it tries to switch lanes from passing lane to exit when it‚Äôs pretty close to the exit, which can be troublesome if there‚Äôs a lot of traffic. It needs quite a bit more polish before I rely on it. Most times, I simply use Autopilot and use the turn signals to change lanes. 

## FSD Only Features

The only feature currently only available on FSD is stop light and traffic light control. For those on HW 3.0 and FSD, the car can stop when it detects a stop light or traffic light. It can be pretty useful for people who drive a lot on country roads with not a lot of traffic.

Also, Tesla has promised to deliver Autosteer on city streets this year, but as of October, it‚Äôs not available yet

## Should you buy FSD?

In my opinion, it‚Äôs not worth FSD with the current features. Stop sign and traffic light control is nice to have, but not worth the double price when compared to EAP. If you have the option to purchase EAP, I‚Äôd say go for it as it offers almost everything for $4,000. Also, FSD or EAP stays with the car and not the driver, so if you‚Äôre planning on trading in your car in a couple years, definitely consider that while making a decision. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre getting anything close to the FSD promise Tesla has been making for a few years.

The other EVs on the market are either not meeting my needs/wants (eGolf, Bolt, Leaf, etc), or are not a great value proposition from my perspective (The Model S is great but with the options I'd need before I'd buy one, becomes more money than I'm willing to spend on a car currently). 

So since I would have to go outside of the EV world, I'd be looking for something AWD, comfortable, reasonably quick (I don't want something slower than I have now, so has to be sub-6 0-60), with adaptive cruise that'll work all the way down to stop and go traffic on the highway. 

Audi S3 seems to be the logical choice. What about you folk?

TeslaMotors,would buy if,6zmlte,Need some objective advice: BMW X5 3.0 vs. Model X 100D,"I'm new to this subreddit and have found it very helpful over the last 6-8 weeks that I've been researching this topic. I am on my second BMW X5 and the lease ends in the next few weeks. I've always done build-to-order X5s so I'm looking at an X5 or MX. 

I've been trying to decide between getting the 2018 X5 3.0 (5 seater; heavily loaded) or the Model X 100D (6 seater version; with all options other than FSD). Either would be built to order (California or South Carolina!) and I need to place an order next week(ish). We are family of 4. 

I wanted to get feedback... OBJECTIVELY speaking, am I missing any considerations? I've listed down the major +ves for each of the cars as i see it. PS - This is based on my 4-5 day test drive of a borrowed MX 75D from a friend. 

The case for the X5 3.0
+ Comparably loaded, it costs about $20K less (after adjusting for the tax breaks) but before fuel savings
+ Heads up display ... believe it or not, this is probably what I'd miss #1 if I went MX
+ ""360 view"" ... this is what I'd miss #2. Super helpful for parking and tight spaces. 
+ No issues with repairs. On the other hand, I've heard/read stories about MX sitting at the workshop for months for body damage/repairs
+ Regular type rear doors. The Falcon Wing Doors seem a bit of over engineered novelty that will causes mechanical issues and takes too long to open/close
+ Solid navigation system with traffic aware rerouting. Don't need to fiddle with Waze/Google Maps.  
+ No ""vapor ware"". What's promised is available when I buy the car. 
+ No range anxiety on long road-trips / adjust trip for supercharging 
+ Comes with runflat tires built-in (no addl. expense to replace factory tires; no need to wait by the side of the road on a flat or try and fix it by roadside!)
+ Good iPhone integration (much, much better than Model X). CarPlay option in 2018 X5 as well. 
+ Windscreen on the Model X is awesome; however, too bright in the August sun. The shade that comes with it is cumbersome and not practical to regularly install/remove
+ Better rear windscreen visibility (also, has a wiper... thought i did not drive the MX in rain)
+ Better insurance rates, like for like (I checked with GEICO in NY) 

The case for the X 100D
+ Drives like a dream. Superb acceleration. Great handling. 
+ Head-turner design. Amazing styling and the falcon wing doors open/close catch attention. 
+ Better crash test performance 
+ AP2/2.5 is already significantly better and more functional then BMW's Driver Assistance Plus package.
+ Slightly more hush ride compared to the X5 (less NVH). Both on 20"" wheels. 
+ Compared to the X5, the MX third row seats are actually usable
+ Over the air updates... continuous improvements available over the lifetime of the car (though I also see that Tesla from time to time can disable features as well) 
+ 17"" screen ... bright, crisp and easy to use interface (maybe indeed better than iDrive). Maps looks good. Controls are easy. 
+ Digital dashboard better and crisper than the X5 (i haven't had a chance to see the digital dash on the 2018 X5)
+ Frunk storage (though overall rear storage ""seems"" comparable)
+ Summon mode and remote a/c activation (the latter being very practical for the cold NY winters)
+ Seats are more comfortable than the X5 
+ The HD rear view camera itself is better than the rear view on the X5 (though it does not make up for the missing 360 view) 
+ Don't have to deal / haggle with a franchise dealership to purchase (though i will say that i found BMW's service in lower Westchester NY quite good) 
+ Saves the planet (no gas!)

Am I missing any facts? 

Edit: Added point about crash test performance.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,9739kt,"My impression of the Performance Model 3, coming from an F80 M3 driver.","I test drove the Tesla Model 3 Performance (P3D) over the weekend, since I was seriously considering it as my next DD. Here are some of my impressions. [I gave a review](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/85ajxa/a_detailed_review_of_model_3_from_a_m3_owner/) of the LR Model 3 before so I'm not going to cover areas such as interior tech or Auto Pilot, as those remain the same with P3D. This post will be focused on driving dynamics.

**Background**: I currently daily drive an [F80 M3](https://i.imgur.com/2v3R8Dj.jpg), which according to Elon was the benchmark when Tesla was developing the Performance Model 3. I've also had some experiences with the other cars in this segment, but nothing too extensive. 

**Disclaimer**: This post isn't meant to be an objective analysis of the car. I'm neither a professional journalist nor do I have extensive track experiences. All following opinions are personal and are formed from a 25 mins long spirited (but within safety limit) test drive session on public road. If you aren't interested or don't find this useful feel free to downvote and move on :)


**Drivetrain:**

Without a doubt the best part of this car, and for many the sole reason for buying a Tesla. As expected it's lighting quick and gives you the uncomfortable feeling from acceleration just like the other Performance Teslas. What also impressed me was the state of the art traction control and how easy it was to put the power down. On a not-perfectly-paved public street I think the P3D can reach 30mph before my M3 can even grab traction. For stoplight drag races or zooming around the town the P3D will curb stomp any competition in this class (or even ICE cars from classes above) any day of the week and twice on Sundays. At 40-50mph+ the magic wears off a little, and I think my M3 is a bit quicker from that point on simply due to better power/weight ratio, but it's still way faster than anyone's daily needs. 

Oh did I mention how easy it was to abuse this power? No downshift, no launch control, just jab the throttle. You can do it repeatedly like turning on/off a light switch. The beauty of EV at its best, which makes it a much better daily driver in traffic than my M3 as well (ok tbf due to that DCT even a Prius is better than my M3 for daily traffic). 

But for people who are into cars, they know M3 isn't known for drag races, which brings us to:


**Steering:**

I really enjoyed the steering of the LR Model 3. The P3D is *definitely* differently tuned from the base version. The steering ratio felt quicker, and most noticeably, the steering weight was **heavy** in Sport Mode. It felt even heavier than M3's Sport+ mode, which is commonly criticized for being artificially weighty. Although the steering was quick and precise, unfortunately it offered a lot less feedback when compared to my M3. My gut feeling is that unlike the M3, the P3D uses the exact same hardware setup for steering as the regular Model 3, but with different software tuning for weight. It's quite good, but half a notch below the best in this class.


**Handling:**

The upgrade in tires from the LR Model 3 made a *huge* difference here. While the base version didn't have much body roll, the car would start to slide like a dead penguin on ice when pushed closer to its limit (and the limit was quite easy to reach even on public roads). The P3D actually comes with the same tires as my M3, and I can now safely say nobody should have any real issue with the handling/traction on public roads.

However the car is heavy, and the weight was constantly felt. My M3 has been feeling like a minivan ever since I drove a Porsche 911 GTS with all wheel steering a couple weeks ago, but after driving the P3D i truly appreciated again how ""light' my M3 feels. In addition to the chassis not giving much feedback, the car just feels less ""lively"" and playful. It's highly capable (and I wouldn't be surprised if it's faster than the M3 on shorter tracks), but quite a bit more sterile as far as driving experiences go. This is mainly the reason I think I'll still enjoy my M3 a lot more on [Skyline Blvd](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/San_Francisco_Bay_Area_Skyline_Blvd.jpg).

Oh btw, even though I'm not sure how this car will do on the track, I have a feeling it will be an auto cross monster.


**The Whole Package:**

But the big question is, is the car worth the $10-15k premium over the non-P AWD Model 3? A bit of comparison here, BMW charges about the same for a M3 over a 340i. But for that price you get not just faster/bigger engine, you get completely different suspension and steering hardware, way better brakes, carbon fiber roof, best leather interior BMW offers along with the best sport seats, and not a single body panel is shared between the M3 and a regular 3 series. It looks and *feels* special inside out.

The P3D, however, doesn't feel (or even look) much different from a LR Model 3 when you are not flooring the car. My Sales Advisor even had trouble finding the car in the lot amid a bunch of other Model 3s. So it's almost like the whole premium is for the acceleration performance (and the better tires if you get the Performance Package). To me it's not a very good value proposition especially since users are reporting the AWD Model 3s feel just as quick in 0-30ish, but for many who just want the best acceleration money can buy at this price range, then it's still unbeatable.

It's a fantastic car, not perfect by any stretch and does not fully capture the appeal of a M3 or an Alfa Romeo GF (I'll still take the latter 2 on a nice weekend).  But if I can only own one car at a time, the P3D would be the way to go. But personally I am leaning toward non-P dual motor one and save $10-15k. That should be enough to get me heated and powered seats on the Porsche 718GTS I've been configuring for a while now...

**EDIT:** Oh I forgot to mention, the P3D can really, *really* use a HUD. When you can go from 0-jail in like 4 seconds, you really don't want to have to take your eyes off the road to look at the speedo while taking a turn at [censored] mph.

With the frequency my delivery advisors get back to me, you'd think I'm collecting their credit card debt, not trying to give them money. I had to switch advisors because I changed delivery locations. The second advisor literally returned 0 of my 10 calls or emails. 4 weeks later I found out that he no longer works with the company. I had to call the sales gallery to move forward on my delivery. If this guy quits. Shouldn't be email get forwarded to someone else?? A 38Billion (lowered recently) market cap company doesn't have a process in place to return my emails about delivery if there is a delivery advisor turnover?!?!? I wonder how many people they aren't delivering to because of delivery advisor turnover.

Lack of training for new delivery advisors:

I get they are pushing for a Q2 goal. They probably hired a tons of new help for just meeting that goal. One of the reasons I took delivery a little later was because I wanted HW3 on my build. So when I was assigned my VIN for my delivery, I called to verify my car had HW3 installed. ""I haven't heard anything about a hardware 3 or FSD computer on the Tesla intranet. We don't have that"". ""We don't give you your purchase agreement until you take delivery"" (I need a purchase agreement for my financial institution to transfer funds, so I can pay for the car before delivery‚Ä¶ catch 22 huh??) It took me 3 hours and 5 calls to get through to him that I wasn't lying about hardware 3 or the purchase agreement.

Sales computer system stuck in the 90s:

I still haven't paid for my car. The reason the purchase agreement didn't generate is that their online portal where I entered the financial institution info DOES NOT communicate with their internal sales portal. I called 3 times today just to repeat the financial institution information that I filled out 3 days ago. However, the delivery advisors can't access their own sales portal either. So I STILL do not have a purchase agreement or guarantee of title. I called them again 6 hours later and they stated that I won't be getting a purchase agreement despite giving them all the info for the 2nd time today.

I am determined to get my model 3, I will buy another Y or the truck in a few years for my parents. But how many are left that are willing to churn through bad experiences to get a car? Any one of the above points is enough to push a qualified buyer towards a competitor. The average American doesn't have the will/expertise/patience to churn through these experiences. ~~The frustrating part is that it will cost trivial amount from Tesla to fix these problems.~~ This company won't survive if they don't fix the problems.

&#x200B;

Edit: as someone below points out, the cost is not trivial.

Edit 2: I had the email of the sales advisor telling me my trade in would be $1k higher than the official trade in. I'm not making this up as what i think i deserve. I was quoted a price by Tesla sales. To those of you that say I should have used the official trade in system: the sales advisor sat me down on his computer and showed me a number. On top of that, he emailed me the number again!! All this happened BEFORE I placed my deposit!! He mislead me on purpose to get the sale. And I did not know there was a trade in system until after I placed my deposit. 

Edit 3: Truth be told. I think the company will survive. I sincerely hope it does. I am asking officially for the mods to rename the thread to ""Delivery issues are not helping persuade new buyers"" or else Tesla will die.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,d87isk,"Struggling with a purchase decision, is 15k worth the difference","Hey /r/teslamotors people, 

&#x200B;

So I've been reading and researching for months for buying a new (to me) car.  For reference I have a dying 2006 toyota matrix with about 180,000 miles on it.  Initially I was going to go the frugal but fun route, buy a cheap used somewhat sporty yet somewhat practical car.  A couple of bad experiences, and now I'm off looking at CPO cars.  Turns out CPO cars are almost the cost of a new one, so started looking at new cars.  Did a ton more research and a ton more test driving (literally 8 dealerships in the last 2 days) and I figured out the car for me, a mazda CX-5 touring with an offer for 25k plus tax title license, etc.

&#x200B;

But wait they have a turbo model, let's go test drive that! so I did, and it was awesome, loved everything about it, but at around 35k (didn't sit down for the numbers yet) I said for that much I can just buy a tesla....so I test drove one.

&#x200B;

Holy shit, I love the model 3, but at 40 grand I'm a couple 10's of thousands away from where I originally started.  But there's the 35k option, and nearly 5 grand in rebates and tax incentives (BTW does anyone know what the cost is to upgrade back to the standard range plus from standard range?)

&#x200B;

So anyways, my first thought is I gotta cool down otherwise I'm spending a lot without consulting my wife (for the record she says buy the tesla, and she hasn't even sat in it yet).  So I call my insurance (AAA) to get a quote, $1900 annual increase vs 456 for the mazda.  The issue is my wife has a terrible driving record, and apparently we can't get insured separately (damnit).

&#x200B;

I've been up since 2 am working on spreadsheets to justify the cost differential.  I even looked up projected prices for gasoline and went with the most expensive projected numbers over a 15 year period, added in electric rates, the 2 years free supercharging that they're offering right now, insurance costs, maintenance, smog, insurance, and assuming I drive twice as much as I do now, and I'm still 15868.33 apart over 15 years (which is how long I'd keep either car at minimum)

Now if this was the model y at the same price point, and all other numbers the same....I think it would be a harder decision, but I really like the space of the mazda.  Do I really need it?  probably not, but I like the versatility and it's basically the same price as a mazda 3, which would be my other option

&#x200B;

But the Tesla is SO FUCKING COOL, and FAST, and FUN, but I also live in an apartment with no charging accessibility, but I do have a supercharger 1/2 mile away.

But 15k saved over the course of 15 years in my investment account could buy me a new car at that time, and a tesla would be a no brainer

Lastly, I basically have to make a decision today, the free supercharging for 2 years ends at the end of the month, and apparently that only applies to cars delivered by the end of the month, supposedly the timing for a custom build expired yesterday

Edit:  So I just called costco's auto insurance, the quote is actually cheaper with the tesla compared to my AAA with the mazda.  I think I'm going to do it once I check the math again

Second edit:  it's not that I can't afford to buy the tesla even with high insurance, it's that I'm waaaaayyy too frugal and I agonize over every detail.  Which is why I stayed up all night making a spreadsheet, since I couldn't sleep.

Edit #3:  So I made the deposit, for those worried about the supercharging only aspect, I did find a LOT of level 1-3 chargers nearby my home and work (I need to figure out what cables to buy).  Insurance quote is quite a bit lower if I switch to costco's ameriprise.  I do have a little bit of time to decide if I want standard+ now or just wait for a bit and buy later.  Everything I'm reading says it's all software limited

I'm beyond excited and the blue with white interior is so gorgeous.  Wife doesn't know yet, she'll be stoked",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/d87isk/struggling_with_a_purchase_decision_is_15k_worth/,ricecracker420,37111.0,0.9923
TeslaMotors,would buy if,8o652z,Model 3 ownership report: ~1 month / 3000 miles,"The Model 3 is already by far the best product I‚Äôve ever purchased.  This has been an excellent early adopter experience.  But that won‚Äôt stop me from sharing criticisms with Reddit, and Tesla.  Reddit first, because I‚Äôm also hoping to learn a thing or two from your comments.

**Things that can(???) be fixed with OTA updates.**

1) WiFi

2) Cabin overheat settings.  When I first got the car it would go to 150 degrees F on a sunny day.  Now it looks like it won‚Äôt go above 105.  This has been a welcome improvement, but I‚Äôd still like to set it myself.

3) I‚Äôd like to be able to set the car to beep when it locks as I walk away so I can stop walking backwards like a crazy person to verify that, yes, it did lock, just like every other time.

4) Camping mode

5) Dash Cam functionality

6) Ability to set and calibrate an automatic increase/decrease in volume based on noise level inside the car.

7) Ability to jump directly to a specific time when listening to longer audio files mainly in the ""tune in"" section.

8) Having the manual on the center screen is great, but it could be way better.  I‚Äôd like to be able to view the actual pdf.  I‚Äôd like to scroll through the key words without swiping forever.  I‚Äôd like to search the full manual for key words.

9) Ability to set the USBs to provide power when the screen is off.

10) Ability to set the phone proximity for locking and unlocking.  Unlock is a little too close for me and lock is a bit too far.

11) I noticed that if the phone app is in use when the door is opened and then you close the phone app before putting the car in drive, the car will ask for the card in order to start unless the app is opened again.  This is weird because if I don‚Äôt ever have the app open, or if I have it open and I keep it open all works fine.

12) If I am stopped and my foot is on the brake at all, I would like (hold) to come on, or I‚Äôd like the option to adjust this.  Right now (hold) only comes on when I push the brake in firmly, so usually I‚Äôll stop at a light on a hill or something and then when I put my foot on the accelerator again, I‚Äôll roll back a few inches.  It kind of feels like I‚Äôm driving manual.

Edit 1: 13) When another phone key is used to play music, my phone key stops working.  I need to go into the app to unlock the car.  Once I drive the car, the issue goes away.

Edit 2: 14) Internet browser.  Thanks u/BurgerAndShake

Edit 3: 15 and 16) More voice commands and ability to set a reminder in the phone app for a time before you go to sleep like, ""hey dummy, you didnt plug in your car, was that on purpose?""  Manual says the car likes to be plugged in, no reason not to.

**Things that CAN'T(???) be fixed with OTA updates:**

1) The stalk on the right side was dented upon delivery.  The plastic bit was loose and could be pulled up.  I took delivery anyway.  Tesla is getting me a new stalk.  It‚Äôs not a big deal even if I need to wait a while.

2) Shortly after I got the car, I found that the normal AM/FM radio did not work.  Then I got an update and it started working, but the sound was a little bit inconsistent.  Then I got the braking update, the one that also included overheat protection, and now the radio is out again.  Weird, but not a big deal.  The streaming is still a novelty, so I‚Äôll probably complain when I go in to replace the stalk.  Maybe this item should be in the OTA section.  I have seen others talking about the radio being inconsistent, but for the most part, it seems that the radio is generally working for everyone so I‚Äôm keeping it in the non-OTA section as more of a needed repair.

3) No tow hitch option.  We bought a bike rack to go into the tow hitch and we wanted to take bikes camping and use the camping mode at the same time.  Eventually we‚Äôll go after market to fix this one.  Bike rack works fine for our other car, but our other car will never have camping mode.

4) Lack of manual open for back doors when power is off (and the way the windows kind of lock the door in place?).  Say I get in an accident and the power is out.  Would I not be able to get out of the car and open the back door to get my kid out?  I could turn around and get my kid and pull them out the front, but that may be difficult if I am injured.  Also, an adult person in the back seat would not be able to open the door to get out in the event of a power loss?  I‚Äôm going to buy a few life hammers for this one, but I‚Äôm also wondering if I‚Äôm understanding all of this correctly.  It seems like there are use cases where the Model 3 setup is inferior to mechanical opening and closing of doors.

Edit 4: Page 7 of the safety manual for Model 3 states that when airbags deploy, door unlock.  So, that's good.  Still not sure if a door will open without power, locked or not.

5) I have the aero wheels and thought it was so cool that I could have two sets of rims one over the other, but then upon adding the center cap and the nut covers, I realized that my expectations were incorrect.  It‚Äôs one or the other and I need a suction cup now to switch back to aero.  I‚Äôve thought about clipping off the inside part of the aero rims so I can get both rims on there at the same time.  That would be a risky move!  Interestingly, my miles per charge seems to be the same no matter what rims I have on so aero is staying off for now.  Also of note, when I took the aero rims off, it looks like the brake dust gets caught in there and builds up.

6) The cigarette lighter power outlet is tilted slightly down.  I think this is a minor design flaw.  I got a Blackvue power magic ultra battery with my dash cam and found that the cigarette lighter plug that comes with the battery is not great.  The metal contact at the end is very stubby and the spring is super strong, so there is really no give.  The electrical contact is unforgiving.  When I would put this plug into the Model 3 cigarette lighter power outlet with the slight downward slope, vibrations and such from driving would move the plug just a hair and break the contact so that the battery would stop charging, eventually leading to a nonfunctioning camera.  I did a little Macgyvering and fixed the plug which was the main problem.  All works perfectly now, but I think it is generally a bad idea to have that cigarette lighter plug pointing anything but up.  Or, cigarette lighter plugs, which only exist because people needed to light cigarettes, should stop being a standard for cars in general.

7) Glitches:  Maybe some or all of this should be in the OTA update section.  You decide.  Backup camera shows black for a few seconds sometimes.  I‚Äôve seen others report this issue.  I‚Äôve had two streaming songs play with a noticeable crackle sound.  I assume this is due to a corrupted file download?  Very early on, maybe first week, I twice experienced a glitch where the music and turn signal sounds cut out almost completely in a regular rhythm.  Hard to describe, but this one has not happened for a long while so I'm wondering if it was fixed in an update.  Lastly, there have been 3 times when I get in the car (lock opens fine) but the screen is off.  Opening and closing the door once or twice fixes it.  Nothing too bad for this early in 3 production IMO, and I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll continue to smooth out the glitches as time goes on.

8) I‚Äôve noticed that I spend less time on r/teslamotors now, because I‚Äôm too busy driving my sweet ride.  This is unacceptable.

TLDR: My Model 3 is great and getting better, but that won‚Äôt stop me from being nit-picky.

Cherry Hill is now telling me they never said that (lying), and after calling Tesla support, I'm being told $5,000 is the price.

I've been effectively cheated out of a thousand dollars by Tesla and I'm mad as all hell. I'm assuming you guys will me mad as well, since I see many comments talking about it. I'm on hold now with Tesla customer service for the 4th time as they ""go and see"" what they can do.

Does anyone have any success stories I can use as precedent?

Edit: **After about a half hour on the phone, they've agreed that they're to honor the price. Seems like we're gonna have to fight for this. Really sucks I gotta jump through hoops on this one**

Edit2: Price list as follows:

* 3,000 at time of order or within 3 days
* 3,500 if I order at any time between the order finalization and pickup, as per the $500 order change fee (Which is pretty ridiculous if you ask me, since it's something the techs said they could do over the air and requires little work, but go off i guess)
* 4,000 after delivery, as per the advertised price when I bought it, and the work of two separate OAs, and multiple staff at two different locations.
* 5,000, but Tesla (after much arguing) said they would lower the price and honor it, allowing me to purchase now at 5k but refund 1k, or I can wait for a specialized order.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/99hs0w/tesla_is_not_honoring_the_4000_fsd_price_based_on/,[unknown],,-0.1676

Within four days, after being approved from Tesla Financial, I received financial terms by email that differed by 100-150 more per month on a lease than what was quoted on the website.  I wrote back to ask if I could cancel because this was more than I was willing to spend.  Later that day I got a call from a 
Tesla Rep who stated the deposit was nonrefundable on inventory vehicles.  This rule only applies to Tesla vehicles in inventory.  If I had ordered a new custom vehicle I would have had seven days to cancel the order.

After getting rejections for the return of my deposit from the sales rep, the finance rep, and the customer support rep, I asked to speak to sales manager.  He told me that there was nothing he could do.  This policy was so unfair, I asked him if there were any circumstances where the deposit would be returned.  He stated no.  Even in case of death of the individual,  he stated most likely they would not make an exception even in those cases.

I asked if the deposit could be transferred to the upcoming model 3.  He stated no.

I asked what my options were at this point.  He stated there were two:

1. I could continue to work with them to look for a cheaper vehicle in inventory but I would have to come to terms by 9/30/16 

or 

2. I could give them $1,500 more and place a deposit on a custom ordered vehicle.

I pointed out I am getting no value for my $1,000 deposit.  He stated again there was nothing he could do.

I'm writing this for some help.  I called the 1-800 number. The customer rep repeated that the $1,000 deposit was non refundable.

At this point, I don't know what to do and this policy has soured me on the brand.  I'd really like to get my money before consulting a lawyer so I was hoping that the forum could offer me some advice.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,dbic1u,Here is Model 3 SR+ summary Read before you buy," 

Hello everyone, so I currently own Porsche Cayenne and Hyundai Sonata-

Porsche is my date night/events car, or if I want to enjoy some good sound while riding in style- occasionally drive it to work on Friday's. Hyundai, I use this for grocery shopping, driving to work and ride share. Had to talk to the wife and show her cost/benefit analysis of switching to electric- we are both young (early 30's) so accepting and adapting to changes in the technological age is not a hard sell to us. She wants the X because we have a 7- seater ICE car for now.

1. If you really want a Tesla Model 3 for those of you that don't have it yet, go to Tesla, schedule to have a rental overnight. All you need is show them DL and insurance, they won't charge you a penny!
2. Before you invest in FSD make sure the one you get has this feature, use it 50/50 while driving. The FSD is still in Beta Mode- the most thing I enjoyed about it is self-parking. But while driving It kind of freaked me out when you reach the red light and you are the one in front. The car WON'T stop! so you will be ready to stop it yourself, sure it'll switch lane's when you signal, but that is the only two things FSD does for now (self park and switch lanes when you signal-oh summon mode). For these reasons, **I don't feel like spending $6,000 for FSD** until it can recognize traffic lights and stop (completely my opinion)
3. Sound on SR+: I know a lot of audiophiles like myself are worried about the sound because of no sub- I was shocked that the audio in the SR+ is almost as good as the audio from my Porsche (the Porsche has bose sound). The SR+ sound does **NOT** suck, again for this reason, I don't think it is worth it for premium interior (10k more!), the only reason for spending that much would be for range 310 miles- however, who truly needs 300+miles /day?? sure road trips etc- but there are almost 3k supercharges in US alone, and you are supposed to take breaks when driving so that range does not bother me.
4. Interior: you can't tell the diff between SR+ or LR premium- and get the aero wheels, it improves the range!
5. the SR+ does qualify for premium rides on lfyt/uber if you want to occasionally drive- for my Porsche, I do executive airport drops, make about $300/week- wait times are bit longer but it is worth it in my opinion.

So in a nutshell, if you can afford to ditch ICE, do it for the environment, I will also be saving $12,000 on gas in 5 years of owning the model 3! ( cost me $50/month to charge- but gas I spend $250/month!)...if you want a referral code to get your free 2k supercharging free you can inbox me- have a great day everyone!",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/dbic1u/here_is_model_3_sr_summary_read_before_you_buy/,Thearcngel,3105.0,0.9918

TeslaMotors,would buy if,6r0odu,"Buying EAP or FSD later on is not truly $1,000 or $2,000 more expensive and here's why...","After playing around with the excel price calculator someone posted on here, I noticed that purchasing EAP or FSD later down the road is not truly a $1,000 or $2,000 difference. Here's why:  
  
A model 3 with no options financed at 72 months with 6% sales tax and 2.74% interest rate costs $560/month. If you add on EAP only, you come out to $640/month. $80 per month difference multiplied by 72 months comes out to $5,760. So that $5,000 option really cost you $5,760. Buying EAP after you purchase the car is $6,000. You save a measly $240 by buying it upfront.   
  
If you buy a base Model 3 with EAP+FSD, your monthly payment is $687. The $127 difference per month multiplied by 72 payments comes out to $9,144. So you save $856 by buying it upfront, not $2,000. 
  
If you live somewhere that factors in your vehicle price into tag/registration renewal, you'll be saving even less by purchasing upfront.  
  
Final thoughts:  
1. The only benefit to buying it with the car is you get to spread out the cost.   
2. Lower financing interest rate increases your savings closer to the original $1,000 or $2,000   
3. Larger down payments negate the savings by lowering principal and lowering interest accumulation  
  
Hope this helps!  
  
Edit: To those of you talking about sales tax on the upgrade later down the road, you'd still only save about $300 on EAP or $976 on EAP+FSD with 6% sales tax. If your state would charge the sales tax. Still less than half of the predicted savings.  
Edit 2: To those talking about totalling your car and losing the money you spent on EAP+/-FSD, most insurance programs allow you to increase the value of the car when you make a change to it so you wouldn't completely lose the money",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/6r0odu/buying_eap_or_fsd_later_on_is_not_truly_1000_or/,specter491,185761.0,0.9836
TeslaMotors,would buy if,94lkle,Test drove a Model 3 friday and not convinced it is the right car (even though wife approved),"I recently posted how my wife [approved of a Model 3 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/93sh7j/model_3_test_drive_friday_and_wife_seems_to_be/) purchase before my test drive and wanted to follow up, if anyone cared, post test drive.

The test drive itself was only about 20 minutes followed by sitting in the car for 30 minutes trying out different features and things. While on the test drive, I really did enjoy my time. The car was more quiet than I was expecting and had a more compliant ride than what I had read. My previous cars in life have been a 2013 leaf, 2000 camry, 2004 Lexus RX 330, 2003 BMW 330ci, and a 1997 Ford Ranger. These will give you some context on how I approach the car. 

Anyways, before we started, the Tesla employee mentioned that ""when I tell you to engage auto pilot, pull the stock down"". I was a bit confused the whole time because I thought I could drive it how I wanted? Ended up not really being the case as I did Auto Pilot a few more times at my own whims to see how it would handle certain situations. She got visibly nervous and concerned when I tried it in stop and go traffic but for me, that's 90% of my commute so I wanted to see how it did. She mentioned it didn't stop for lights and things like that, which I knew, but still was uncomfortable. One thing the Autopilot did that didn't know it would do was getting in the exit lane and slowing down off the ramp. 

Besides Autopilot, which is about 50% of the reason I want a Tesla, I really enjoyed the car. I couldn't believe how amazing the map interface was. It was just like Google Maps on our phones which seems like something basic you should have but then you realize no other car manufacturer is doing that. Being able to long press a location and set that as a destination just works and is HUGE. I loved it. Other things like the vents, split air conditioning, and glass roof have all been covered. As a tall person I also really enjoyed how much leg room and head room I had. You'd be surprised how difficult it is to find a car that has both adequate headroom AND legroom, especially in a sports car. The passenger seat along I could almost stretch out entirely. Never been able to do that. One nitpick is I wish it was a hatch back. That would have been incredible.

As far as the drive itself, I thought I knew what to expect since I have a Leaf but it doesn't compare at all. When you accelerate it is instant torque, like the leaf, but it's a whole other ballgame. More than just the speed of it, it's how it holds you there. My leaf kinda jostles you a bit and isn't super compliant. In the Model 3, and I imagine all models, you really feel connected when accelerating. And I'll just say that the car is SUPER fast. Dangerously so for me hah.

Overall, I liked the car a lot but I am not sure I want to spend $1k a month for 5 years on it. I bring home $255k a year with my wife and could afford it but I wonder what would happen if I had to take a less paying job? That would be a big car payment. The car itself I love so much. It was truly the future and a standard for all cars to follow. I just have to now decide if I want to pay that much. I **strongly** recommend if you haven't test drove one yet to do so.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,i3re6e,"Service center says ""Climate control odors are not covered under limited warranty"" for model 3","Those of you who got the mildew AC smell covered under warranty, how did you do it? What did you say to the service center? It is annoying that some service centers will cover this problem and other service centers expect you to pay for it.

&#x200B;

I recently bought a used 2018 model 3.

Drove it for the first few months, when it started getting hotter where I live I began to blast the AC, something I did not try to do when test driving the car (my mistake, I know). 

But blasting the AC, my god. It smells like mold dipped in vinegar and left to bake in the sun for years. I found other tesla owners with the same problem have varying degrees of success. I have read that some people bring their model 3 into the service center and they were able to successfully solve the problem and have it covered under warranty.

&#x200B;

But others (like me) have been told that climate control odors are not covered under the warranty and had to either DIY solve the problem (buy air filters, buy the AC cleaner, open the panels, spray the cleaner, reinstall filters, etc.) or simply pay out of pocket for the problem (service center quoted me roughly $110)

&#x200B;

My understanding is that Tesla released a software update to help reduce the source of the mold smell - after parking and leaving your car the fan will turn on high for a while to remove any condensation or moisture left on the AC, which causes the mold smell.

&#x200B;

But apparently the cars that were affected before this update will still have the mold smell. 

&#x200B;

Since Tesla released a software update to fix the mold smell aren't they admitting that this problem is not due to user error and as such should be covered under warranty?

I'd rather not spend the money to DIY when I know this problem is not created due to user error. Any help?

Edit:
After sending another message that this is due to manufacturer defect, Tesla should cover under warranty, this is acknowledged by Tesla since they released a software update to fix, etc. They just replied the same ""unfortunately this is not covered under warranty message.""

They told me parts and labor cost for cabin filters was $65. 

The total cost for parts and labor for disinfecting the AC and replacing cabin filters was $120.

I asked if they could install 3rd party filters I bought to save me some money but they said they're unable to install 3rd party accessories.

I would go through with paying for this repair out of pocket if that meant they could then warranty their work.

Like if I pay them $120 now to remove the mold smell and the smell comes back in like a year or two I have to pay them another $120? I'd be fine paying this amount if they could warranty it and offer free repair for any future mold smell.

Edit 2:

I called and spoke to someone at the service center. They told me that the mold smell has never been covered under warranty (!?). They then said that mold smell falls under cabin filter maintenance which is something the customer always pays for.

I texted the service center and asked them if I pay for the repair and the smell comes back in a year or two would I have to pay them again? This was their response:

""It depends on when it returns. We've seen majority of them don't return, but there has been an occasion where after a year + it did, and is responsible by the customer. If it were to return within a very short period, we would have to present the detail to management for approval on covering the cost.""

Pretty frustrating, I guess I'll just cancel my appointment and DIY. Anyone know easy tools to lift up and pop out the panels that hide the evaporator oils?",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/i3re6e/service_center_says_climate_control_odors_are_not/,quazimootoo,10218.0,0.9742
TeslaMotors,would buy if,6ynd43,I will always want to be able to own and drive my own car. How about you?,"I personally think this idea that no one is going to want to own a car anymore is overblown. I personally love driving, just not in heavy traffic.

I love my car and I don't expect to ever stop owning my own car. I will not however, buy a car that is built on the assumption that I don't ever want to drive it.

The one gripe I have with Elon's implied vision (based on some statements that were made to explain lack of certain driving features in the model 3 - ie - this isn't needed because the car is going to be self-driving) is a design direction that assumes/implies that shortly no one will ever WANT to drive the car. Elon would be correct, if he thinks people like me don't want to own that kind of car (this is not the model 3 but a next-gen vehicle, built to never be driven or hardly at all), but that doesn't mean we don't want to own a car at all...

I don't want to be an eternal passenger, I want a driver's car, but one that also takes away the hateful drudgery of rush hour driving and gives me convenience like summoning, when I want it, and the rest of the time, lets me take the wheel and have fun with MY car.

And by the way, I don't care if the economics say it is cheaper to not own a car and have it always drive itself. That's simply not the experience I want, so the economics of that world are immaterial to me. I don't care if it's free.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,b68a6r,Letter from Elon to retail employees about the recent changes to the stores and the sales team,"There still some uncertainty around Tesla stores and the sales team. Hopefully, this note clears things up. Please let me know if there‚Äôs anything I‚Äôve forgotten to address.

‚Äì Stores with a high visitation rate and that lead to significant sales will absolutely not be closed down. It would not make any sense to do so, except in rare cases where the rent is absurdly high. Moreover, Tesla will continue to open stores throughout the world that meet the above criteria.

‚Äì Stores that are in a location with low visitation rates (ie empty most of their opening hours) and lead to low sales will gradually be closed down. This is analogous to seeds on barren ground. There is no reasonable way to justify keeping such stores open.

‚Äì Stores that are somewhere in the middle will be evaluated over time to see there is some way to allow them to cover their costs. If there is, they will remain open, otherwise not. However, these stores will be given a fair opportunity to prove their case.

The above principles also apply to the sales team. No one who is a major contributor to demand generation will be let go. That would make no sense. However, sometimes, in a company with 45,000 people, things happen that make no sense. I will do my best to remedy issues when brought to my attention directly or through [redacted email address].

What is meant by ‚Äúall sales will be online‚Äù is just that the act of purchasing a Tesla will always be done via the potential new owner‚Äôs phone or computer. This is true whether they are at home or in a store. Unlike buying from other carmakers, ordering a Tesla doesn‚Äôt require any *physical paperwork*.

This is very different from normal expectations for buying from other carmakers and is simply meant to emphasize that ordering a Tesla is super easy and can be done in 2 minutes from your phone or laptop at Tesla.com. Ordering a Tesla is not much harder than ordering an Uber, but hardly anyone knows this!

However, many potential Tesla owners will still want to talk to a Tesla representative in person or want a test drive from a Tesla representative. Stores also have a small number of Tesla vehicles available to drive away immediately for customers that want a car right then and there.
This is why stores and Tesla product specialists and owner advisors will always be of critical importance to our long term success.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,8ii641,"Another dang Model 3 review, from a rural first time ev owner.","Since I have enjoyed reading everyone else‚Äôs reviews of the model 3, I thought I would jump on the band wagon and write a quick review myself after having mine for almost  weeks now and logging around 800 miles. 

How I may be different than other reviewers: 

1. This is my first ever electric car

2. This is twice the cost of my car I am upgrading from \(14 Accord\)

3. I have 3 daughters under 10 years old, and make a modest solid middle class salary

4. I live in the sticks \(my county has 26k people and 1 stoplight\)

5. I live in rural Virginia. My morning commute to work is 30 miles and involves 4 stoplights in the last 3 miles of it.

So right out of the gate I love the car. Sometimes I feel like I am not worthy to have it and feel a little too flashy in it because about every 3\-4th person I pass on the road definitely stares it down. I‚Äôm pretty sure I am the first Tesla in my whole county. My kids and wife LOVE it, especially the girls and the all glass roof. 

My vin is #12,8\*\* and there are no issues with it. All that worrying I did over the quality for nothing, the car is great! Well, the only issue is the ‚Äúphone key‚Äù on the app does not work. I have seen others report the same trouble, and that the fix is easy, so eventually when I get to the Service Center again \(about an hour away\) I hope to get it corrected.  But, I am more than fine using the key card. At $5 a pop I plan to be buying a few more cards just in case too.

Things I did not expect because either I wasn‚Äôt paying close enough attention \(and I have been on this sub nearly every day for the past 2 years\). 

\* the cell signal relies on ATT \- which sucks in my area and especially my house. What this means is the app is worthless at home because the car can‚Äôt connect; so no pre heating/cooling in the morning or checking charge from my bed at night. The model 3 does not connect to home wifi \(yet\), but even if it did my internet sucks in general \(but hopefully that will change in the next year or so\). This also means that the radio and streaming are spotty unless I‚Äôm on main roads or in metro areas. 

\* Even when I‚Äôm in a good cell network, at work, the app is slow to load and generally by the time I think about it \(leaving my office on the 4th floor\) and across the parking lot to my car, I‚Äôve made it to my car before the app loaded. I have iPhone 6plus.

\* I still feel range anxiety. I had a wall charger installed at the house a week into it, but I‚Äôm still far more conscious of my &#37; battery life than I should be. I think it will get better as I am better, as it definitely has improved, but it‚Äôs there. Fortunately there are enough super chargers in the nearest two big cities. Of course my commute takes a bout 70 miles every day, filling up to 90&#37; \(270ish range\) it hurts. My 4cyl Accord would go almost 600 miles on a tank and the low gas light would come on with 70 miles left, so I am trained to think that sub 100 miles is almost empty. I will get over it, but it's going to be a while.

\* Watching people try to figure out how to get in/out of the car is great fun. It really sets the tone on ‚Äúthis car is unlike anything you have ever experienced‚Äù. I have never demonstrated the manual release to the kids so they are not tempted to try it and have had no issues with the button.

\* EAP is awesome. It works fine on my country roads with a single middle line \(but I‚Äôve only engaged for demonstration not utilization\), using it on interstate is great though.

\* HOLD. Being able to press the brake in and have the car in hold at lights and other places is great. I never thought about it before, but it‚Äôs a real leg saver.

\* 0\-60 launch. It‚Äôs great fun and blows peoples minds. I know S&X are much quicker, but the 3 is more than good enough for me. Also, it‚Äôs far more impressive from 30\-60 or so than a dead stop. 

\* Keycard. As I mentioned, the phone key is not working for me, but fortunately I have a wallet/phone case. So I keep my key there and it‚Äôs really easy to tap on the side pillar. I do wish the key worked on both driver and passenger side though. Also, as far as unlock \- I have the mirrors set to fold/unfold on lock/unlock which helps as a visual aid to know when it‚Äôs locked or not.

\* Autopark. Have not even tried it. I have seen it pop up a few times, but never in appropriate circumstances and so I have just ignored it.

\* TuneIn. Works great and is awesome ‚Ä¶ when you have a cell connection.

\* Washing. It‚Äôs so much easier now as the car is stumpy and easy for a 6 ft person to get reach the top and the sleek door handles are fantastic for washing.

\* Roadtrip. Went about 250 RT one day for work and the great thing was the destination had a destination charger. I can‚Äôt wait to submit that mileage report and get $100 for a trip I spent about $7 charging for.

\* Unique. While I‚Äôm still unique in my county, the city I work in \- Charlottesville \- is a Tesla haven. I have already seen 5 model 3‚Äôs and the other day I saw my exact twin \(silver/aero\). This car is going to be massively popular once they can crank them out and get past the pre\-order backlog. I think I am driving the early equivalent of the VW Beetle. That makes me sad for the coolness factor, but awesome as a Tesla investor. :\) 

Lastly, I leave with you with some hilarious comments that I didn‚Äôt expect: 

	\* ‚Äúis that your iPad you put there?‚Äù \- referring to the screen

 	\* ‚Äúis this even legal?‚Äù \-referring to EAP demo

I'ld like to hear what Reddit has to say about this project!  


Choice of the vehicle :  
We want it to be an EV.  
We need good range, good miles per kWh, lot of space in the back for sleeping etc, 4WD.  
And my wife isn't comfortable with the idea of driving very big cars, like the Cybertruck for example. Also, very big cars wouldn't be practical in europeans cities (we live in Montpellier's downtown).  
(And we don't want to do something like buy a Cybertruck for this travel, sell it and buy a VW ID3 when we're back, since we want to do (big) road trips several times in the next 2/3 decades)  
I've looked at a lot of vehicles, and the Model Y Long Range seems to be the best choice.  


Would someone use another car ? If so, which one and why ?  
And if you think the Y is the best choice : Why ?  
I know it has amazing range, very good miles per kWh for its size, lot of space in the back (The Y has 2158L of trunk / frunk etc...) : it's beautiful, very nice to drive etc.  
Apart from all this : Why would you choose the Y for around the world road trips (and not another SUV / CUV etc ?)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Questions about the Y :  
What is the maximum maximum range of the Y ? (The long range one)  
I'm not talking about WLTP or ""Official range"" or something.  
 I mean, driving only at optimal speed (something like 40mph ?) in a not rainy day on long, straight roads, with almost no altitude variations etc ?  
Does someone has a link about a test in these conditions ? :o

In the last 24 hours though I've been getting major cold feet. I am generally rather risk averse by nature and generally make financially well-thought out decisions. My only real concern is what happens to support for the 3 if Tesla doesn't make it. Unlike most ICE cars, we are very dependent on the service centers for both hardware and software support.

I installed a NEMA 14-50 and obviously paid $3,500 to Tesla so I've got $4,000 in sunk costs that are not coming back if I back out. I'm trying to weigh that against needing to spend additional $50k+. Money is not a constraint but I'd really be mad at myself if it turns out I waste this kind of cash in a year or two.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,ynp5tq,"How Tesla Optimus might work, from an end-user perspective","My daughter asked me today if we could please buy a few pre-release Optimus robots if we win the $1.6B Powerball. She wants something that will clean her room for her - and the sooner the better. She also doesn‚Äôt understand the economics of housecleaning. Optimus, hopefully, isn‚Äôt for billionaires who can just hire meatspace help. It‚Äôs for the rest of us who reclaim time with Roombas and dishwashers. We already have special purpose robots. I

 told her that, unfortunately, an early release of Optimus probably won‚Äôt be very satisfying. They need time to finish it so that it is able to do the tasks we assign it. We‚Äôve all had new tech that wasn‚Äôt polished yet. We can see the potential but it ultimately sits in a drawer.

Remember back to 2007(?) when Steve Jobs pitched the iPhone as three new products: A portable Web browser, an iPod, and a camera before revealing that all of these were, in fact, a single device. But the iPhone‚Äôs converged functionality was a handful of (very useful) apps. It wasn‚Äôt open-ended. Optimus is going to be convergent in the same way the iPhone was. It‚Äôs going to do many manual tasks for us.

But the original iPhone was a pretty closed system. It only had the apps that it came with. Optimus won‚Äôt be like that. There won‚Äôt be an app with a list of predefined jobs that you can tell it to do: unload the dishwasher, change the laundry, or the dozens of other automatible things that would make it a successful product.

The fact that Tesla is making a humanoid robot is an important tell about how we will use it. Tesla didn‚Äôt do this to make Optimus more relatable. It‚Äôs much harder to make a humanoid robot than it is to make a claw on wheels or something with a more functional design. The reason Tesla is making Optimus humanoid is because it will be designed to learn how to automate tasks by mimicking us in the immersive environment of our homes.

Another important tell is the fact that the operating software is built upon the FSD stack. Much of FSD is focused on environment recognition and spacial awareness. It‚Äôs also notable in that it adapts to its environment rather than depending (fully) on maps. This capability for recognition is not just so that it can navigate our homes: it‚Äôs so that it can watch what we‚Äôre doing and then reproduce it.

Here‚Äôs what I think a training session will be like:
1. You‚Äôll say something like ‚ÄúHi Optimus. I‚Äôm going to teach you to unload the dishwasher‚Äù
2. Then you‚Äôll describe each step while it watches: (A) ‚ÄúFirst I open the dishwasher door by squeezing the handle and pulling it down.‚Äù(B) ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll put the plates in the cabinet up here‚Äù as I open the cabinet and place the plate in my hand on a recognizable stack. (C) I‚Äôll spare the reader the details about storing bowls, pans, Tupperware, and silverware. (D) Eventually I‚Äôll tell Optimus I‚Äôm done with the task so that it knows the end state of putting the dishes away. Hopefully I remembered to close the dishwasher door before I do that - otherwise I‚Äôll be tripping over the dishwasher door for the next year until I get back around to editing the task.

To be successful, Optimus will have to depend on a robust object classifier. It has to be able to tell the difference between plates, bowls, silverware, etc. It has to be able to tell a small spoon from a large spoon - something my wife has noted that even I am not very good at. This training method would depend on Optimus being able to classify a large number of mundane objects. Luckily, image segmentation and object classification is an area of active progress. I don‚Äôt think most other companies are using it for automation training though.

But there is more classification here than simple object recognition: Optimus will have to have a catalog of manipulations that it recognizes in my motion as I complete the task. This is beyond object manipulation and is perhaps a little challenging because of the hidden visual parts and the temporal component - but it is trainable if Tesla starts with a list of generalized actions that it can classify my actions into: door opening, grabbing and twisting, lifting, pouring, etc. It‚Äôs a finite list, but not short. It‚Äôs an interesting question about how short this list can be made through generalization. The generalization will probably come by breaking the manipulations into sub manipulations in the same way that machine code can be broken down into microcode. But this is is the core reason that I believe that Optimus is humanoid: so that it can map our training actions to its own execution actions.

I think of this as very similar to the Siri Shortcuts app. If you have an iPhone and if you use the app, you know that you can name a task and then add a series of  steps that uses capabilities of other apps in a high level scripting interface. Later you can tell Siri to run that script verbally or by pressing a shortcut. I doubt that Optimus will have a script editor just because mimicry will need to be the scripting method. End users won‚Äôt have the patience to script every step of most tasks and coming up with a taxonomy for describing most actions would be too much for most people to learn anyway.

I can see how such this system could be built. If I can see it, then I‚Äôm sure those smart men and women at Tesla can see it too. We‚Äôre all building applications in this new paradigm of machine learning using NLP, image classification, simulations, and all the other tools that enable us to do so much more than we could in the older procedural paradigm. UX will also be front and center here if we‚Äôre going to make this product for the masses. I can‚Äôt think of a prior example of a speech and vision based low-code platform.

Accuracy will be important. With FSD you‚Äôre already in the driver‚Äôs seat so every minute of automation is a minute where you can chill and enjoy the ride a bit. But you‚Äôre still at the wheel ready to intervene. It‚Äôs harder to intervene when Optimus puts a fork into the toaster instead of into the fork bin next to it. Will early releases of Optimus leave dishes in the dishwasher because it doesn‚Äôt recognize them? Will it put away dishes that are still dirty and cause a new problem? What‚Äôs that smell in the cabinet? Like Tesla‚Äôs other projects, there is a long tail here.

I can‚Äôt wait to see :-)

TeslaMotors,would buy if,6igky6,Tesla is buying back my X (as a lemon) but deducting Fed tax credit.,"Hey all.  To set context, I picked up my X 90D in March of this year.  Since then it's had a slew of problems.  Each time I would bring it back for repeating problems PLUS some new ones.  Fast forward to now and I am working with Tesla to have them buy back the car.  The price they're giving me is minus the $7500 tax credit.  This doesn't sound right to me. The car would have been purchased and returned in the same year; I haven't even been able to file for that credit!  And why does Tesla get to save that money?  They don't fund the tax credits do they?

I'm a diehard supporter of Tesla and their mission and so it's important to add that as naive as I may sound, I think my X is an anomaly and am willing to give another one a try.  But as it is, the money they're giving me isn't even enough to cover the cost to order a new one.

For a company that prides itself on customer satisfaction, it baffles me that they're forcing me to put up even more money upfront if I wanted to take a chance at having a working car.

Am I being crazy?  Does anyone know if I have any grounds to dispute the deduction?

I spoke with the person from Tesla this afternoon and she said that if I don't qualify next year to use the entire $7500 credit, I can show them proof at that time and they would give me the difference.  Of course, I've asked for this in writing.  But after reading all your replies,  it still doesn't sit right with me that Tesla has any say in this;  it should be between the IRS and me. Add to that, I have to put $7500 additional upfront to replace a car that's defective.  I just want the car replaced at no upfront cost.  I have a meeting with them tomorrow and I'll ask to speak with their legal dept regarding all of this.  I'll keep everyone updated.

**CONCLUSION**:
After a couple of phone calls today, I was able to get the deduction removed.  Tesla will buy back the car at its full price minus miles used. Thanks again for all the helpful replies!

TeslaMotors,would buy if,b0fzlk,Need your input on my experience taking delivery on a new model 3,"Hi Tesla people. So we got our Model 3 today. Yay! We went with the Long Range Dual-Motor AWD version, and added the 19"" wheels, autopilot, and full self-driving capability. When it arrived, the guy drove it up. Ok. I was kind of expecting a flatbed truck, but ok. He then had us sign a document identifying the car as an executive or showroom model? He explained that it was not, according to the DMV, a ""brand new"" car, but don't worry, he assured us, it only has 26 miles and really is brand new. Then, he told us the car was a 2018. This was surprising to me as we ordered a new 2019 direct from the Tesla web site. He again told us to not worry, that this car was manufactured in 12/18 and it was the same car as any other Tesla out there. When I asked about trade-in value down the road, he informed me it was a non-issue. 

I am just feeling a little weird about this. Buying this car was a big decision, and I want to be sure I got the very best product at the very best price. It feels a little like we got two unexpecting curveballs, a 2018 model and a ""not new"" car. 

So here is my question. Does all this sound normal? Am I making a big deal out of nothing, or does something seem rotten to you all as well? 

Thank you for anyone taking the time to share your opinions and thoughts.

**UPDATE:    

So I called the 800 number and spoke with a nice person who instructed me to call the delivery center. He informed me that in matters like these, the delivery center handles all issues. So I called at 9:00am. It just kept ringing. Again at 9:05, 9:10 etc..., continued ringing. Checked yelp, yes they open at 9:00. Kept trying, nothing - just continued ringing. I tried for the next 2 hours. Finally, at 11:25, a young man answered and heard my issues. He said he would speak with his teammates and get back to me in 10 mins. At 2:00 I started calling friends who own Teslas and asked if this was normal, one of these friends had a ""secret customer service number"" and I called it. Spoke with a very helpful person who put me on hold to call the delivery center and help get this sorted. After 10 mins on hold, he returned to say they were not answering for him either. This person did follow up with an email, CC'd me, and asked if it was not resolved by Friday to get back in touch with him. He gave me very good customer service, was empathetic, and understanding. 10/10. 

At 4:52 I heard from the call center. The person I spoke with informed me that the manager reviewed my situation and said the car was not a demo/executive used car after all, and they would get rid of the document I signed which said it was. After a long pause, he said, ""so we're good."" To which I said ""sure"" and hung up. 

I mean, I guess this is ok.... But it all sure feels weird. Also, what's with no one answering the phone at the delivery center. I have hours invested in this process not to mention a rollercoaster of emotions: absolute excitement about our new can, total disappointment, confused concern... on and on. I love Tesla, I love what Elon is doing and his vision - I have been a supporter of his for years. It is really sad that my first experience owning one of his cars was this...awkward. 

At any rate, I guess this is resolved. I want to thank everyone who responded and shared your thoughts, experience, and advice.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,8qze85,My Model 3 Delivery Experience - Day 1 with 314 miles,"Well, after two years, today was the day. 


Picked up my brand new Tesla Model 3 this afternoon in Richmond.  Arrived about half an hour early, and had let them know I was going on a roadtrip directly afterwards, so they had me nearly 100% charged.  The car had 11 miles on it.  Now the car has 325 miles on it.


First off 5 things I never thought I'd do:

* I never thought I‚Äôd buy an American car

* I never thought I‚Äôd buy a car i hadn‚Äôt physically seen

* I never thought I‚Äôd buy a car I hadn‚Äôt ever driven.

* I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd buy a car that was actually a robot (see video linked below)

* I never thought I‚Äôd buy a car new


Now some notes on the experience:


1) Communication was good prior to delivery.  All my questions were answered, although you can tell that they are busy and somewhat overloaded as they get processes and procedures in place.  I was called on Memorial day with the delivery estimate of 6/21; I informed my delivery specialist that would work, but I had been hoping for the 12th as I had a road trip scheduled.  The next day I was all over the paperwork and financing documentation, and when I called back she told me it could be bumped up to the 15th.  I told them unfortunately it was the 12th or 21st due to the trip; they said they'd try for the 12th.  It didn't make it, but I was able to juggle some things around for the 13th- I don't blame this for this at all though, as it was already 2 days before they had originally stated.


2) I bought a J1772 connector because I didn't realize that one came with the UMC; for some reason something that I read here lead me to believe that wasn't the case, and the town I was driving to only had one level 2 charger, and it was J1772.


3) I had the day one reservation car in the center console!


4) Quality was exceptional; delivery experience was great.  Was concerned due to all the things I read on here, so people should know that you can get a car that's perfect - it does happen.  Despite being at the end of the day, the delivery specialist seemed like he'd take as much time as needed to go over everything - he took pictures of us with the car, and when it was done asked me what I thought and I said it was a lot - he offered to go over it all again.  Reading the manual and watching the videos doesn't quite convey the number of settings and features.


5) They are running behind on the paperwork, so I didn't get mine until Sunday night (for expected Tuesday delivery at that point).  I didn't want to pay online, so I showed up with a cashier's check.  Unfortunately, somehow the registration fee was miscalculated on the original site and what was communicated to me, so my cashier's check was $5 less than required (I put a downpayment down and financed the rest @ 3.29% through a Tesla organized loan with Chase).  The fee was corrected on Tuesday afternoon, but by then I'd already gotten my cashier's check.  I paid the difference with a $5 personal check.  Not really a big deal, but it was a bit annoying as I was being very, very communicative (trying to make sure I had every single thing I needed), and not having the right amount on the check probably bothered me more than it did them.


6) Pulled out, had some distance, so punched it.  It's very, very quick.


7) Autopilot calibration didn't take terribly long.  Once calibrated, started using it on the freeway - s/w version is at 18.13, but the update will run tonight to 20, so it'll be interesting to compare.  I'm concerned about the nagging, as I had my hands on the wheel and was paying attention, but had to move it slightly to get it to recognize; I understand after the update it'll be every 30 seconds.  Also, sometimes it would subjectively feel like I was jiggling it the same amount, but it would deactivate the autopilot.


8) I've been working with software my entire life, and I watched this video (TRAIN AI 2018 - Building the Software 2.0 Stack https://vimeo.com/272696002) recently, so thinking through how the autopilot works was pretty interesting.  There were a couple of times when it slowed down unexpectedly (once in a tunnel and once as a grey shiny car passed next to me at night).  Otherwise, it was pretty predictable, but *only because I read everything on here*.  A couple of things that are non-obvious and can startle you:
	
* When using assisted lane change, you need to make sure you don't let go until fully in the new lane.  If you're not far enough, it'll lurch back into the lane you were coming from, which will likely disturb people behind you (and probably in the car as well the first time it happens).
* You need to be aware of what your speed is set to as well, because when you change lanes, if the new lane is open, you'll accelerate to your set speed while changing.  This is nice and how it should be, but can surprise you if you were down to 45 but set to 70 for example (down to 45 because the cars in front of you were going slower).
* I can see how the accident in California happened- at one point tonight there was split, and the car was drifting a bit towards the right as the lane widened.  The car in front of me pulled off to the right, and as they got out of directly in front of me, the car accelerated (because the set speed was 63 or so, but the traffic had been about 45), as it accelerated, it also realized there was a split and pulled back to the left.  It did everything correctly, and I was watching it carefully because I knew it might make a mistake there.  But I think if the order of operations was slightly different and/or the road was slightly different, I could see how it could have been accelerating into it's lane and trying to recover to the left stripe and hit the gore zone.

	
9) The auto wipers were pretty cool, but a little slower than I would have liked.  I will say that the rain was a bit odd too- very large drops, but not a ton of them at first.  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SSYFMtdJ5k)


10) I tried ""bug report"" at one point, which wasn't as much of a bug as a navigation issue - if you're travelling north on I-95 and you want to stop at the Aberdeen Supercharger, the in car nav takes you past it and has you uturn and go back to it (entering from I-95 southbound).  In reality, the supercharger is located on a rest area between I-95N and I-95S, so it could be entered either way.  I feel this is a pretty serious navigation issue - navigating to Superchargers should be something that's setup with unit tests and known good values to compare against map revisions.  BTW, I don't think the bug report comments went through as I didn't talk fast enough, but not sure.


11) At the supercharger, we plugged in, walked inside, and ate.  It charged 100 miles in just over 20 minutes.  Incredibly fast; also there was an X next to us, and it was making a lot of fan noise- I think because it was combating the heat buildup.  I didn't hear a fan on ours at all, but then again we were inside until it was complete (to 80%)


12) I came from a 1994 Jeep Grand Cherokee; unfortunately, I'm handy enough that I've been able to MacGyver it enough to keep it running for a long time.  I recently had to bolt a piece of t-steel on the driver's side door to secure the opening mechanism as the door steel rotted out.  Comparatively, this car is indistinguishable from magic.


13) Having test driven an S in Florida a year ago, I knew what to expect with respect to creep/regeneration, so I set the car on no creep, normal regen.  Had no problems with.  Also, the ""hold"" happens when it should, just based on how I drive.  So that's nice.


14) First time parking is interesting.  You put it in park, then get out and leave.  The radio is still on, the lights are on, etc.  But as you walk away, the key is out of range, and everything shuts down and the mirrors fold in.  As others have mentioned, an audible bleep would be nice; another suggestion would be a push notification as well (either one configurable of course)


15) I arrived just at dusk to the supercharger, and when I came back out it was much darker.  We started the car, and I merged onto the highway.  Suddenly I freaked out for a second because the dashboard lights weren't on!  I was thinking ""oh no, what happened?  What do I need to reboot?"".  Then I realized that there are no dashboard lights, only the center display.  Was a bit disconcerting for a second there.


16) Supercharger cables are short.  You have to be closer than I would have normally parked.


17) I have no idea how or when I'll get billed for the supercharger, or how much it cost.  I'm sure it's just something I'll find eventually.


18) Looking over your shoulder out the rear of the car vision is poor; this correlates with Consumer Reports.  The backup camera is very big, and resolution is good.  It's going to take me awhile to get used to using the camera vs. over the shoulder, but I think over the shoulder is likely more dangerous than looking at the camera.


Suggestions:


1) Range as battery percentage or miles is great; however, for the masses, showing something resembling a traditional fuel gauge may help in the transition; i feel like you over analyze it with either miles or gauge, but people are used to E 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 F  (Note - as a software guy, I *do not* like this; but I think it might help for people that are transitioning from ICE)


2) The rear view camera is great.  You should be able to make it be one of the cards that shows up below the vehicle while you're driving forward.  I don't want it taking up the entire screen (that's too big, and I want to navigate), but I'm already retraining to glance at the left side of that display as I drive (vs the rearview mirror as before), so put that on the bottom of the display; that's more useful than the TPMS (although don't replace, just add another card).  I know it will be small, but I think it'll be big enough that you could get a feel for vehicles behind you.


3) The keys show up as ""Unknown Key"" on the key display, and then my iPhone shows up by it's name.  All of these should be renameable.  The current key that's driving the car should have a transparent blue rectangle behind it's name (or something) so that when you rename them, you know which one it is.


What's really cool is that some of the suggestions above could actually make it into the car; Tesla is one of the few companies where there are enough people that are reading these posts and enough people that care, and enough vertical integration, and a delivery mechanism, where features could be added.  In fact, tomorrow I'll have a different user experience than I had today.  That's amazing.


All in all, it was totally worth the two year wait.  For those of you still waiting, hang in there- it only gets better from here.

I do not make a ton of money but I saved up for a few years to afford the monthly payments for a long range model 3 with self driving. Since I got the car around 2 months ago:

1) There are scratches, I didn't see at first, all over the car. I take some of the blame for not thoroughly inspecting the car but still.... there is a huge jagged, circular scratch almost as if someone tried to take a bite out of it. There are scratches on the top window. There were scratches on the front of the hood.

2) The seal on the door is broken. The wind noise is as loud as if the windows were down. The seals around 3 of the doors are twisted and ""bubbling"" up.

3) There is a massive blemish in the base paint. You can't see it unless it's in the right light but once it's visible it's horrendous. The service center workers in Tesla were taken aback when they saw it and said it would be fixed free of charge. The managers came back and said they wouldn't because their policy dictates they don't fix issues after 72 hours. I asked why I would have to pay for an issue caused by Tesla and they said it's their policy and they can't help me.

4) The foam in the roof was exposed and coming out. The service tech had to come and fix it.

5) The wood in the panel was misaligned and I had to take a razor and tuck it back in.

6) The trunk was misaligned and rain water was getting in. They had to come and move it, revealing the steel base underneath. I have to repaint.

7) One of the door handles is indented further than the others.

Tesla fixed a few of the issues however the expensive ones they refuse to fix even after admitting they were factory defects and totally their fault. I will have to find a way to pay literally thousands of dollars to fix Tesla's mistakes. 

All of these issues have occurred in the span of 2 months. Buying a Tesla was one of the worst financial decisions I've made in 2019 and I'd like nothing more than to return the car. I used to think Tesla was one of the good guys but their severe lack of quality control, their terrible manufactured cars, and their willingness to allow their consumers to pay for their mistakes was an expensive lesson as to how terrible the company really is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/da74ra/tesla_the_worst_car_manufacturer_there_is/,oystagoymp,1841.0,-0.9866

>Now, as part of our commitment to make Tesla ownership **easy for** **everyone**, including those **without immediate access to home or workplace charging**, we are expanding our **Supercharger network** into city centers.  
>  
>Supercharger stations in urban areas will be installed in convenient locations, including supermarkets, shopping centers and downtown districts, so it‚Äôs easy for customers to charge their car in the time it takes to grocery shop or run errands.

>  
>We will continue to expand our charging networks so that Tesla owners always have abundant and reliable access to charging wherever they go.

Superchargers are for everyone, including those without home or workplace charging and they are supposed to be far cheaper than the cost of gasoline.   Regardless of your personal beliefs on who should and should not own a Tesla this is how Tesla sold Tesla to its customers.    Tesla sold cars to people without home charging on the promise of access to the supercharger network at prices far cheaper than the price of gasoline.   To those who say you shouldn't buy an EV without evaluating your available infrastructure, you are correct.  But that infrastructure must include Tesla since Tesla chose to sell their cars with a proprietary plug.[https://www.tesla.com/blog/supercharging-cities](https://www.tesla.com/blog/supercharging-cities)

The appearance of massive price hikes on customers who have no choice but to pay looks really bad.   Tesla needs to either rethink their pricing structure for urban chargers or else release a CCS adapter so that Tesla owners can vote with their dollars.   If Tesla doesn't owe its customers the opportunity to use alternatives and Tesla retains the rights to substantially increase prices to extract as much cash from its captive audience as possible then I would say people shouldn't buy Tesla vehicles.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ahqeaf/supercharging_cities/,im_thatoneguy,154758.0,0.4921

If it's a track-only car, then it's a really bad one because everything that makes a track car good is the opposite of what the Roadster aims to be.

No road car can compete with a race car. You want tons of downforce all the time, you want the car to weigh 2500 lbs or less. You want a suspension that could never be usable on the street. You want slick tires that will last longer than not.

And for drag racing, you can already buy road legal cars that can down 6s in the 1/4 mile. A Twin Turbo Huracan can put down 2000+ hp and still be used on the road legally.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,d8af32,Yes You Can Swap Your Model 3's US Red Turn Signals with EU Orange (Maybe - Video Inside),"TLDR: Swapping a US for an EU tail light was plug and play on my US car, but it came from the factory with a right side EU tail light. YMMV (see video)

My car was delivered with a right side EU tail light and a left side US tail light. Tesla offered to replace the EU tail light with US under warranty but would not install another EU tail light. Tesla would not even sell me an EU tail light no matter what I tried. I ended up buying a right side EU tail light on the secondary market. I plugged it in and it worked immediately. If you watch the video to the end you'll see the pinout and harness for these lights. In my mind the only way this should work as a plug and play is if the car detects which tail light is plugged in. The US tail light shares the turn signal and brake signal on one pin. The EU tail light has a dedicated turn signal pin. The car's harness is wired for both. I'm real interested to hear everyone's input on this. Perhaps my car is an exception because it came from the factory with a working EU tail light. Perhaps it was programmed for it already, I'm really not sure.

An interesting thing to note when watching the video - When the turn signals are off and brakes on, BOTH the turn and brake lights come on together. I'm not sure if this is correct or legal, but it's good by me for now.

In any case, I'm happy to have working independent turn signals. Tesla wants to sell the safest cars possible. This seems like a no brainer for the US market. EU Part numbers below.

This morning at 6:30AM I placed my $2500 deposit on a 2015 85 with Autopilot, Tech Package, the 4 year warranty, and good clear pictures of the car. Price before tax was $41,800. By 10am I had a phone call from a very cheery woman from Tesla explaining everything I needed to know and what to expect. She even offered to setup a factory tour since I would be picking up the car at Fremont.

To get to this point, I stalked ev-cpo.com for the last two weeks while I waited for my credit report to update with some paid off utilization. This morning the reports finally were up to date so I applied for a loan from Navy Federal, was instantly approved for $50k, then placed the deposit.

Over the last few weeks I went around and around on exactly which model and features I wanted and could afford and reviewed photos of many CPO cars. I drive long distance a lot so I knew I wanted at least an 85. I also wanted autopilot. Performance would be great but was optional. I went around and around on 21 vs 19 rims and finally decided 19 made the most sense economically but I'd settle on 21 if it was a good deal.

I had good success pressing the Request Photos button on the Tesla website and usually had photos in 15 minutes. Some were BAD. We are talking, quarter panel dents, rims beat up to hell and back. Others looked pristine. The one I finally settled on had a few superficial nicks and one spot of curb rash. The rest was pristine. I was happy with that.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,6qd6ch,"My thoughts on last night's reveal, the Model 3 itself, and understanding why others have differening opinions","*(Wall of text warning)*

I waited in line to reserve my Model 3 at about 10:40 am on the east coast last March, so it's safe to say I've been eagerly anticipating the final reveal for a while now.  

Here are my thoughts on last night:

* I was excited to see the final specs.  310 miles and 5.1s 0-60 exceeded my expectations for the upgraded battery by quite a bit.  220 and 5.6 for the base were what I expected, with an outside hope they'd hit 240 miles range.  Of course the 5.6 0-60 is better than I thought when I plunked down $1,000 in March.
* Very happy that they released pricing information for various options.  They were all in line with what I expected.
* I loved the various first drive videos people posted.  [Bjorn's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiv9esQ3Glw) was good, [this one was good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwrYnXe9lLY&t=18m8s) in particular.  I watched a few others live last night that I can't find links to now.  People seemed to be impressed with the interior.
* This [first drive review by Motor Trend](http://www.motortrend.com/cars/tesla/model-3/2018/exclusive-tesla-model-3-first-drive-review/) made me downright giddy.  It's about the only information we have on how the car actually drives, and they loved it.
* It's nice Tesla provided estimated delivery information.  My one serious disappointment is that the dual motors version will not be available to me until Sept-Nov next year, meaning I'll miss out on half of the tax credit if I want it.  Probably prices it out for me.  I survived driving a Mazda RX8 in winter for a decade, so I'm sure I'll do fine with the RWD Model 3.  
* Would have been nice to have Musk spend more time talking about the features of the car instead of getting most of the details when the press embargo was lifted.  

My thoughts on the Model 3 itself:

* I think it's fantastic that I can finally get a long range EV in my price range without compromising the way I drive.  The range of the Leaf or BMW i3 wouldn't cut it for me.  I think the Bolt is a great car in its own right, but the lack of supercharging is a hindrance.  I don't do 200+ mile trips that frequently, but it would be an annoyance to make other arrangements for the 5-10 times a year I do.
* As I said, the supercharger network is fantastic, and they're doing a great job of building it out in my area.  I'm glad I don't live in a place where overcrowding of chargers is a problem.
* I love the speed of the car.  My old Mazda RX8 did 0-60 in about 6 seconds if the weather was right, you were adept with the clutch, and the engine was new.  And it was pretty quick.  Doing it in 5.6s or 5.1s with no skill involved is frickin' sweet.
* I've been a big fan of the exterior styling from the start.  For me cars fit in 3 ranges:  Love it (relatively small chunk), normal (vast majority of cars), hate it (relatively small chunk).  I love the Model 3's styling.
* I love the center screen.  My first thought when I test drove a Model S was, ""Wow- that screen is huge and awesome!"" and I think the same about the Model 3 even though it's a bit smaller.  Not having it integrated to the dash makes no difference to me.  Neither does the speedometer being placed there.  I just see it as the difference in glancing down (and having to adjust around the wheel to see it in my car) and dancing down to the right.  I use cruise control in most situations where it matters anyhow.
* I was concerned about the air vent at first.  Almost seemed like Tesla was being different for the sake of being different.  Any concerns I had were erased when I saw how the vent was adjustable on screen last night.  That's awesome.
* The interior is a bit spartan compared to other entry level luxury cars.  Not my favorite thing, but certainly no deal-breaker.  I'm glad that several reviewers (publications and random people at the event last night) pointed out that it *doesn't* feel cheap.
* The key card / phone app to open is interesting.  Not sure what to think on this- probably depends on how it works in person.  Is there a wait when I get to the door?  How quickly does it lock when I exit the car?  Might be a hair of anxiety on my part if I can't hear the doors click when I walk away.  Interested to hear first-hand accounts on this.
* Excited to use Autopilot.  Tried it out with a Model X for about a mile last weekend, and it was smooth as silk.  I do think this will make my daily work commute on the interstate more relaxing.  This is a feature that sets Tesla apart for me.  I think it will still be a few years until FSD offers enough features to make it worthwhile for me, though.
* Servicing is a concern for me since it's 90 miles to my local service center.  I know there are going to be some issues if I get an early build- the question is how much?  I put up with a Mazda RX8's quirks for a decade, so it's not as if I'm against driving a car that needs a little more TLC.  Feedback on the first few thousand off the line this year will be important to me.

By in large, I was pretty stoked after the reveal and release of information last night.  So naturally I was a little surprised when I saw the negativity popping up on here.  People tend to assume others will think like they do, right?

So I've been sitting here trying to understand why others have reacted more negatively [instead of just being like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJX4ytfqw6k) (which I probably haven't totally succeeded at).  While some people will always just stir the pot, I try to assume most people are fairly reasonable- they just look at things from a different perspective.

I think the main issue is that somewhere along the line Tesla has realized the need to manage two different sets of needs, and it's a difficult balancing act.

First off, people in general want to feel like they're making a great decision and getting the best of the best for their money.  I think of it like when I ate at some fancy restaurants in Las Vegas for vacation this year.  When I'm paying over $100 for my dinner, I want more for my money than just great food.   I expect more.  I like to joke with the maitre d' and my server.  I expect my server will know the menu inside and out and be able to make recommendations.  I want to have some ridiculous decor and see the Bellagio fountains out the window.  Inside?  Yeah, I like seeing those Picasso paintings on the wall.

I think it's the same way with the Model 3.  It's not just about the car.  People want to hear how the EV technology is the best in the world.  How you'll love Autopilot.  They like the story of the upstart company beating out the big boys.  They want more personal service than they'll find at Jiffy Lube or the Mazda dealer.    They want to hear Elon Musk wax poetic about the challenges and how Tesla has squashed them all to be the best.  It's about the car, but it's also about the brand, the story, the lifestyle, and the idea that the customer individually matters.

Second, Tesla needed to manage expectations for the car.  The hype train was getting out of control, and I'd bet it was starting to impact Model S and Model X sales somewhat (which is a huge problem for Tesla).  I've seen a lot of people hem and haw and claim otherwise, but it's clear many were expecting the Model 3 to be a half-priced Model S, just slightly smaller, a bit less range and speed, and no fancy door handles.  That simply wasn't ever going to be the case.  

So if you're Tesla, how do you make sure people understand that the Model 3 isn't just going to be a half-priced Model S while still making everyone feel really good about their purchase?  It's a fine line to walk, and I don't think they've succeeded at it very well.  That's probably the source of a fair amount of disappointment.

They clearly went overboard when they first put up the Model 3 / Model S comparison page, and that caused the natives to get restless.  They did smooth things out a bit once the backlash became apparent.  And last night Musk's presentation was a bit lackluster.  All the information came out eventually, but people wanted him to wine and dine the online crowd.  Get inside the car, talk about the key card, play with the air vents, give us a nugget of new info about Autopilot.  Remember the crash test comparison with the Volvo?  People ate that shit up.  *That's* the type of stuff they wanted- that they *needed* to see.

I think some disappointment was that people had pricing expectations that were unrealistic from the get-go.  Deep inside they may have known they were a bit unrealistic, but seeing the price tag was like finally taking that dive into an icy pond.  I think most of it was people seeing what they wanted to see, urged on by the occasional hype-filled but vague statement by Musk.  Also $35k is still relatively pricey for a car, so people were probably having to stretch their budgets to buy it at that price as-is.  Finally realize they won't be able to get everything they want at a price they can afford?  Bummer.

A year ago people were told it would have a 215 mile range, < 6.0 seconds in the 0-60, and cost $35k.  Well, they nailed that.  I think part of the problem was that the Bolt hit 238 miles of range, so they naturally assumed the Model 3 would beat it despite any firm evidence.  Some Tesla fanatics have spent so much time slamming other carmakers that it really was inconceivable that their cars are nice on their own merit as well.  As a college football fan, I think of it like message boards following a loss.  The fans who are most pissed off are usually the ones that spent the previous week slamming the opponent and talking shit about them.  

Along the same lines, it surprises me that some people are now treating the 220 mile base version as if it's completely worthless.  Hell, people were *excited* when the 215 mile range was announced last year.  What changed?  I can only surmise that people are disillusioned that it fell behind the Bolt, even though the 18 mile difference is negligible in real world driving scenarios.  Perhaps it was also bumping up the base battery packs of the Model S so that 220 miles seems worse in comparison.

The battery is a good example of poor pricing expectations.  Everyone knows it's an expensive component, but it's almost as if they expected Tesla to sell the upgrade at cost.  When looking at how much battery upgrades cost for the S and X, I thought for sure it would be a $10k+ upgrade on the Model 3.  So coming in at $9k was a pleasant surprise.  [This survey on TMC](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/poll-how-much-will-the-75kwh-upgrade-cost.91998/) shows people had vastly different expectations.

Another issue is people don't like packaged options.  I figured [this would be the case](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/6foeil/prediction_model_3_rollout_and_the_next_three/dijqrr7/) a while back, and the fact that Tesla started packaging options for the S and X that were previously individually configurable should have been a further hint that would happen with the 3.

Several people have been adamant they would deliver base $35k version of the car first, despite Musk explicitly stating otherwise over a year ago.  Perhaps they ignored it, perhaps they assumed that it changed when they announced dual motors would be delayed.  Regardless, a longer wait for the car leads to disappointment.

Also, the fact that the Model S starts at $75k should be a hint that options for the Model 3 will go up quite a ways.  It wouldn't make sense to have the Model 3 cost $35k-$50k and have a big gap in between.  Just comparing with the BMW 3 series, Audi A4, Mercedes C300 should show that if you want the car loaded, you'll be paying quite a lot for it.

There are other examples like that, but I think it boils down to the same thing about expectations vs reality.

There are also subjective disappointments.  Some people wanted a smaller car, some people wanted a hatchback.  Some people don't like the exterior or interior styling.  Obviously, there's no way to build a car that pleases anyone.  All of this stuff has been long known, but I'm sure getting that final confirmation that it wasn't what some people wanted was disappointing.

Regardless, I'm still very excited to be buying my Model 3.  I still haven't decided for which options I'm going to get (leaning toward upgraded battery, premium package, blue/midnight silver, Enhanced Autopilot), but it will be fun figuring them out for sure in the coming months.  Tesla has produced the car I expected them to over a year ago, and in some ways better.  I can't wait to get my hands on it, though I understand others no longer feel the same.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/6qd6ch/my_thoughts_on_last_nights_reveal_the_model_3/,LouBrown,203024.0,0.9994
TeslaMotors,would buy if,cikiw9,Opinions on what Tesla should do to the Model S and X.,"So before the model 3 came along, the S and X were pretty much the most technology packed car you could buy IMO. Though admittedly other luxury cars in the same price range probably had (and still have) more luxury features, it was still a good trade off for the amount of tech you were getting and autopilot. But now with the cheaper models having pretty much all the same features, minus a few things like air suspension and such, and with the Model S being nearly twice the price of the Model 3..what do you think the best course of action would be for Tesla to make their premium line stand out more? 
Personally, I hope they don‚Äôt cut features from the Model 3 to reserve for S and X. IMO, I think they should try to focus on making the luxury aspect of it more apparent. If I got anything wrong let me know. Just kind of got to thinking about it. Would like to know the communities thoughts on how they‚Äôll handle the S and X.

But the entire drive, the sunroof was rattling, my seat was squeaking, and the glovebox door was opening (it struggles to stay closed) and spilling items into my daughter's lap. My Tesla was feeling less like a car from the future and more like my grandmother's Buick.

My sincere hope for the Model 3 coming in large volumes is that they are able to have access to a superior supplier network and build a more reliable cabin around an amazing drivetrain. The car wants to be great‚Äîit really does‚Äîbut some of the joy is lost over worrying about what may go bad next.

Here's the thing: I will say that Tesla more than makes up for the defects with an amazing customer service attitude, but I fear service centers will really be struggling to keep up if the high-volume Model 3 has as many quirks. THAT is my worry. 

Would I buy a Tesla again? I hope so, but I'm really hoping Tesla is able to add quality, durable parts to it's list of boxes that it checks.

U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan said the court needs to make a ""minimal determination of whether the agreement is appropriate"" before he would sign off on the deal. She said the law requires her to determine whether the enforcement action is ""fair and reasonable, with the additional requirement that the public interest not be disserved.""

The judge gave them a week to submit a joint letter explaining why she should approve it.

Former federal prosecutor Jay Hulings said the order was unusual, ""but not unheard of.""

""It's odd given the nature of this settlement. If there's is a class action, it's common. But just for SEC enforcement action, particularly with a big fine, it's unusual,"" he said.

Musk and the SEC reached a settlement on Saturday, just days after the agency filed a lawsuit alleging that Musk misled investors about having the funding necessary to take Tesla private.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,6dfd19,When will Tesla support CarPlay and Android Auto and otherwise improve the interior car computer?,"Tesla is about to launch their most important product, the mass-market Model 3. People who are buying the 3 will not be your typical early adopter like the buyers of the Model S, who have been willing to ignore the fact that the S lacks a lot of creature comforts found in the luxury models offered by BMW, Mercedes, and Audi.

However with the launch of 3, the increasingly outdated and poor feature set of the interior car computer and center console screen is going to be something that a lot more people will be experiencing and it simply does not hold up well against the offerings from even extremely cheap cars sold by the ordinary American, Japanese, and European carmakers.

Things that Tesla needs to have implemented ASAP, like I don't know before the 3 launches:

(1) Android Auto and CarPlay. 

https://www.android.com/auto/

https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/available-models/

Pretty much everyone is on board with CarPlay and Android Auto. Except Tesla. This is made more irritating by the fact that the built-in apps like Google Maps are increasingly outdated and feature-poor, since they don't get updated nearly as much as the apps in your phone. It also makes simple things like media playback from your phone to your car more aggravating than it really should be in cars which are billed as the most advanced on the road today.

(2) Media player overhaul.

I realize that a lot of people insist on using the built-in media player in their car instead of streaming their music collection from their phones. Well, the media player sucks. We all know it sucks. Elon knows it sucks. So why isn't it being improved? I can't possibly imagine that Tesla cannot spare like 1-2 developers to work exclusively on the media player and other built-in apps in the car, especially since those wouldn't be the devs working the Autopilot or something to begin with.

(3) Bluetooth support for AptX from Android devices.

My separate thread about this lives here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/69c56q/why_doesnt_teslas_bluetooth_support_aptx/

In general, the Bluetooth on Teslas is kind of crummy. People complain about it refusing to reconnect properly all the time. Also it needs high quality music playback from Android. This isn't optional. I don't care if Elon only owns iPhones and probably hasn't touched an Android device in his life. This is not acceptable and will not be acceptable when the 3 becomes widely available and more than just Apple users in California own Teslas.

(4) Automatic volume leveling based on speed.

This is a pretty common feature in cars now from the $10k price point to the $100k price point. To put it quite simply, the car automatically adjusts the volume of music based on how fast you are going, which is rather nice. It's also kind of nice when the car automatically starts your music at a lower volume when you get in and leave instead of blasting your ears at the highway volume you had it set to when you got out earlier.

(5) Navigation

This is a big one, since one of the primary competitive advantages of Teslas over other long range EVs is the Supercharger network. Google Maps does not show Superchargers and doesn't route cars through them. This is mainly a Google problem but since Elon apparently hasn't ever touched an Android device in his entire life he doesn't seem to realize this. It needs to be addressed. But the other problem is the built-in nav system which does have Superchargers is based on Garmin or something and isn't updated regularly. So you have to choose between Google Maps which is up to date but doesn't send you through Superchargers, or the built-in nav which has Superchargers but is typically at least a year out of date because it updates like a conventional standalone GPS dash-mounted package that is only manually installed once a year because those devices operate offline.

(6) Misc. Apps

Well, we know the media player is trash. The built-in browser is slow as molasses and outdated too. The radio is regularly criticized for being slow to change stations, and starting with the 3 people are going to be buying Teslas who actually still listen to terrestrial broadcast AM/FM radio. Honestly, I feel like there is no one working on app development full-time at all in Tesla and that will not be a very good thing soon now. But again, a lot of the problems with the built-in apps would be rendered moot if Tesla would just support Android Auto and CarPlay.

I feel like I wrote a lot more than I meant to. But this is stuff that needs to be addressed before Tesla transitions from the tiny market of $100k+ ultra-luxury cars to the mass market of $35k cars. There is much more competition in the $35k space and most people will not be as willing to give up things just to buy an EV which should be treated as fundamental in the mass market as they would when they are early adopters of cars mainly sold to the rich.

Also, I sincerely hope and pray that the 3 will come with enough cupholders for all 5 people who will be seated in the car. That shit will not fly in the $35k mass market. It's a miracle that Tesla was able to get away with only 2 cupholders in a $100k+ car as long as they did, but the early adopters are always more forgiving than the mass market.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/6dfd19/when_will_tesla_support_carplay_and_android_auto/,unknown_soldier_,61588.0,0.9829

TeslaMotors,would buy if,8rcn7w,My thoughts and experience after 2 days of Model 3 ownership,"Hi all, I wanted to share my experience in getting my new Model 3 and my thoughts on the car itself. I know these threads come up pretty often, but as someone who was eagerly awaiting taking delivery of my Model 3, I read about every single one of these threads, and I hope it's useful to some of you out there who are awaiting your own Tesla. I was a day 1 reservation holder, online, non-owner, from Nevada. Invited to configure on 4/18, first contact by the ISA on 5/26, took delivery 6/13. Midnight Silver Metallic, Aero wheels, no Autopilot. Here are my thoughts on the buying process and the goods:

* I took delivery on Wednesday morning in Rocklin, CA. The few days leading up to delivery were extremely stressful. Being from Nevada, I had to have a NV DMV Power of Attorney form notarized so that I could take delivery and Tesla could do what they needed to do with the DMV. I was also waiting on the Motor Vehicle Purchase Agreement form, so that I could know the final amount that I had to pay. I didn't receive either of these forms until Tuesday at around 4PM, giving me pretty minimal time to do what I needed to do. I also feel like it wouldn't have been done in time if it wasn't for my constant nagging. 

* The day of delivery was much less stressful. My wife and I arrived at Tesla about 15 minutes before our scheduled time, had some coffee and looked at the Model X and S in the showroom. Our Delivery Specialist (DS) came out and met us, and we went and looked at the car, which was plugged into the supercharger (I had requested a full charge, since I had to drive back to Nevada). Checked it out for a few minutes, then went back inside and took 10-15 minutes to do the paperwork. After that we went back to the car where our DS gave us a thorough walk through of the hardware and software, took our picture, then left us to go through our delivery checklist.

* The car is almost perfect, the only thing wrong is that the glove box doesn't open. Our DS said that this affected a small batch of cars, and that we would be contacted for service to come fix it in a week or two. The funny thing is that I've mentioned to my wife a couple times that I wish the glove box wasn't software controlled, so of course that happens to be the one thing wrong with the car. But other than that, couldn't find anything wrong.

* Man I love how this drives. The instant torque is amazing, especially coming from an old Honda Civic that does 0-60 in about 2 minutes. I love coming up to red lights, being the first car in line, and putting my foot down when it turns green. Makes me (and my wife) smile every time.

* Driving over the mountains was kind of a weird/great experience. I'm so used to hearing the car downshift and rev the engine as you start heading up a hill. With cruise control set, the Model 3 just maintains the speed, doesn't bat an eye, make any noises or lurches... it's awesome.

* I can definitely see the appeal of autopilot, since having that would make it a lot easier to interact with the touchscreen. I kind of feel like I have to be on high alert when I'm changing the temperature, changing from radio to streaming, etc. I wouldn't be surprised if I pull the trigger and upgrade, although I'll probably wait until it's a little more capable.

* I'm digging the phone key, haven't had any issues with it. We were pretty wary just walking away from the car the first couple times, but now I trust it enough to lock when I walk away.

* About 25% of the time that I open the Tesla app on my iPhone, it is unable to wake up the car. Hasn't really been a big deal though, I rebooted the car yesterday and that seemed to help some.

* I installed the Aero Wheel Cap Kit almost right when I got home. The Aeros do look better in person than they do online, but I like the way the car looks with the cap kit much better.

* Charging has been easy enough. I had a NEMA 14-50 installed in my garage a few weeks ago (cost was $223). I realized that plugging in the car was the first real test of the outlet, glad it's working well haha.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,glq6xl,Why does everyone praise the cybertruck so much despite some very big flaws?,"Like yes it is a different looking vehicle, yes it is cheap, and yes it's stainless steel body is a good idea on paper, but I can never see it being a fleet vehicle for multiple reasons. 

For one, while the stainless steel exo-chassis body is a good idea on paper, what happens when it does get damaged? Sure you can try to repair it (which will be a pain) and have an imperfect finish because the steel doesn't quite match up ever, but its structural damage, and that means even a dent anywhere on the body will basically write off the entire vehicle, maybe with the exception of the front clip because it looks like that may be removable. 

Secondly, the unibody design, yes it helps rigidity, yes it helps keep weight down, yes it helps make it simpler to manufacturer, but what happens when you want to slap a flatbed on it? Or if you are an electrical company and need a utility box? Or maybe you just want to remove those sloped panels above the bed so its easier to access? The answer is nothing, because once you mess with that, the structural integrity is comoletely compromised. Now it could be avoided if it was just a deperate piece that just had some really good anchor points, but no, its stuck as it is. So maybe it will be great for the dude who needs to carry around a couple pieces of drywall or a quad, but it will never be anything else other than a basic pickup.

Thrirdly, why did the roof have to be so low before the bed starts? It could have just had a small 1-2 foot section that was just flat right at the end of the windshield, and then just slope it back down, then you would keep the aerodynamic properties of that shape, and you would be able to load so much more into the back of the truck because you can stack stuff way higher, though I don't even think you can tie stuff down from the sides of the bed because of how its designed.

And lastly, why did elon even do all this in the first place? Like he is supposedly such a great engineer, but there are so many flaws in the design that could have been so easily avoided. So why did he do this to a generally great concept? Yes I understand he wanted to make it as cheap as possible, but the problems I mentioned would have *maybe* bumped up the cost by another 1-2k, maybe 5k at most, but it would have been a much more versatile vehicle at that point. They could be a decent ev alternative to an electrical companies fleet of trucks if they could replace the bed with a utility box, it could have been an incredible towtruck, it could have been a decent flatbed for towing around skidsteers, it could have been so much, but its just a pickup, and nothing else.

So I just generally want to hear what you guys think of all this, because I know twitter will just blindly follow stuff, but maybe I will get some different opinions here.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,7snfhe,"Considering buying a Tesla for the first time, would like advice.","My current lease will be up later this year, and I am considering buying a Tesla for my next car.  I've never had an electric car before & know nothing about it, so I'm hoping for some advice from current owners.  So many questions have occurred to me to ask, but I don't know anyone who has a Tesla to ask, so if anyone can offer some advice, I would greatly appreciate it!

Is it difficult to set up a wall charging station at home?  I would assume I would need to have an electrician install a 220/240 V outlet in my garage (?) Or is that not the case?

How often would you have to charge at home if you use it normally for just a daily 15 mile commute each way to & from work, with only minor errands added to that?  (Est. 40 miles of driving per day).  Would charging be a daily routine, or just a couple of times a week?

When you travel, how difficult is it to find a public charging station with open outlets?  Is there a good chance you could locate one, drive there, but find that the outlets are already being used, necessitating a trip to another charging station some distance away?

Once you find a public charging station, and it's open, doesn't it take hours to charge your car?  When you fill up gas, it's a 5 minute stop.  So if you have to wait hours while your car charges, are these charging stations typically within walking distance of restaurants or places where you can wait comfortably?

Any advice is greatly appreciated :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7snfhe/considering_buying_a_tesla_for_the_first_time/,[unknown],,0.9492
TeslaMotors,hate,ooi0qy,"Might get blasted for this, but I think the hate against opening up the SC network is ridiculuous","Probably not a welcome opinion here, since I dont own a Tesla vehicle, only stock. But after reading through the recent threads on sharing the super charging network I'm turned away by the elitism and complaining. 

I 100 percent believe that Tesla opening the charging network is a carefully thought out decision, and not just an Elon meme.

I'll summarize for three quick reasons;

1. **Government grants** - Its fairly obvious to everyone by now that Tesla chases government money. Subsidies bring down the cost of vehicles and provided the upfront capita needed to compete against established automakers. Under the new Biden administration there is a huge fund planned to spur EV adoption, infrastructure and development, Tesla will not want to miss out on this chunk of change. Opening up the network is how Tesla proves they are contributing to the renewable vehicle infrastructure, that is how you go from pennies in subsidies, to big fat cheques to build new chargers.

2. **Charging standards are more competitive** - Tesla plug types account for the overwhelming majority in North America (around 25k last time I checked), however CCS is the standard world wide and not only is it what Tesla switched to in Europe due to regulations and consumer demand, but other standards like CHaDeMo are soon to be switched to CCS. Benefits and Cons for each standard aside, its clear the world governments want to settle on one standard, just like how you don't have to choose a different shaped nozzle when filling up your ICE vehicle, I shouldnt have to worry about what adapter to bring when charging.

3. **Its Tesla's motto, and will benefit Tesla owners and the EV industry** - Tesla has always aimed to make EVs mainstream, and that wasnt ever expected to be only through them in a monopolistic system. By sharing the network, it opens the door for other manufacturers vehicles to become more viable. It also surely forces other manufacturers to up their infrastructure rate so they dont lose their customers to charging at the nice shiny and convenient Tesla stalls (and possibly paying more to charge). I understand concerns about giving up competitive advantage, but you all need understand that this would have ended eventually. The EV market is only growing, and as more manufacturers started putting out their own chargers that all followed the CCS standard, Tesla would end up in a situation similar to the Apple lightning charger vs USB C. However in this case, it might end up worse for Tesla as they could be mandated by the government to switch to CCS without reaping any of the infrastructure fund benefits.

To close out, I get its annoying to share a crowded charging station with other non Tesla EV owners, but this kind of clanish attitude and elitism over other brands is what ends up pushing people away from Tesla. Just think about it, how would you feel if you used your adapter to charge at a non Tesla station and some dude in a Leaf rolled up and told you to f*** off?

Lets all cool off and look at this objectively, Tesla has not made this decision willy nilly, and at the end of the day they could roll it back all together and my post will look stupid.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ooi0qy/might_get_blasted_for_this_but_i_think_the_hate/,_Cubed,28939.0,0.9949
TeslaMotors,hate,ka99a1,Unintentionally hate my ICE vehicle after test driving a performance M3,"Tesla is my favorite company in multiple aspects. Their upbringing, mission, groundbreaking products... I just love them so much and have for a few years. 

I‚Äôm 20 years old and in college and currently drive a pickup truck that isn‚Äôt too speedy, but still can pass cars with a breeze. For the past couple of years I‚Äôve been convincing my parents to purchase a Tesla and we‚Äôve been on 2 test drives. (I was not the driver for either of these trips). 

Under GA law, for some reason I was under the impression that you had to be at least 25+ years of age to test drive a vehicle. After some curiosity, I called a local Tesla showroom and found out you only had to be 18. I shouted from the rooftops after hanging up the phone and immediately booked my test drive as soon as possible. 

A week later, after checking in for my appointment and getting settled, the employee said, ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre going to be driving the performance Model 3, I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs okay with you?‚Äù ‚ÄúAbsolutely‚Äù. I sat down in the drivers seat and was astonished even though I fully knew what to expect. Due to Covid, employees weren‚Äôt riding in the vehicle with you. Instead, they send you on your way for roughly 20 minutes to do your hearts desires. 

After driving for a few minutes and getting used to the braking system (which I absolutely loved) I approached a red light and I was the first car in line. When it turned green, I (safely) tested out the acceleration. I got a head rush, was thrown back in my seat and couldn‚Äôt hold back my laughter. I couldn‚Äôt believe how fast this machine that I was in charge of could go. I proceeded to get on the freeway and merge with no trouble at all as the acceleration gives you plenty of confidence to get in front of cars. I let autopilot take me a few miles and had it pass cars in lanes, I was smiling the entire time. Couldn‚Äôt stop myself no matter how hard I tried. I was quite literally in my version of heaven and bliss. 

After returning to the dealership and chatting with the employee a bit about the Cybertruck, Texas Gigafactory and other Tesla related topics, I left and immediately felt a sense of near sadness when I put my foot on the gas of my pickup truck. There was no instant acceleration, no sound of the futuristic engine, no regenerative braking... my brain was confused. I knew obviously that my truck would feel different, but in those 20 minutes that I got to drive the M3, I wanted to so badly be used to that feeling of driving all the time. Nothing is comparable. 

So now here I am 2 weeks later dreaming about owning a M3 or CT someday and getting that feeling back. Coincidentally I had to take my truck to the shop to fix some oil malfunction and it only fueled the fire more. Can‚Äôt wait to be a future owner, and can‚Äôt wait to get that feeling back. I‚Äôll forever reminisce on the amazing experience of driving a Tesla.

I‚Äôve been on this sub for a while and have seen people ‚ÄúICEing‚Äù superchargers and keying peoples EVs. Additionally after some pick up truck driving relatives learned of my Tesla purchase a few days ago they started making passive aggressive ranting posts on FB about EV driving young people and telling them that they can‚Äôt drive their gas cars anymore because ‚ÄúAl Gore told them not to‚Äù.

I‚Äôm not particularly left or right leaning. I am certainly not a tree hugger. I‚Äôve always loved great cars and Tesla is what I want right now. But I would never shit talk someone for driving any vehicle gas or other.

TeslaMotors,hate,pvq0aq,Unpopular opinion: I hate the safety score system and I don't think it should be used at all,"So, this morning I did what most of you did, hit the button to get in the queue for the FSD Beta. The fact that the potential of getting the beta is dependent on how this safety system is rating is F-ing infuriating and I wish I could get the money I paid for FSD back from Elon. The FSD is paid for (for years) and we have to basically pass this ""test"" to get it? The way I see it, we shoveled out a fuckton of money for the car and also for FSD. If we sign the paperwork that we take responsibility for our actions, then we shouldn't be tested by a computer based on just some hand selected data. 

The factors used to establish whether or not you're a good driver are fucking ridiculous.   
The FCW system is buggy as shit and it triggers quite often when a truck decides to turn in front of me.  But that's just one of the many problems. Today my score went down to 78 merely 'cause I was braking hard 5% of the times and apparently I took ""aggressive turns"" 14% of the times on a short trip. WTF?   
I think these are infuriating factors. I don't know about you guys, but if someone cuts me off (and that happens a lot in LA), I gotta hit the brake hard to avoid slamming into someone. What's my other option? Slam into an idiot? Sure would keep my score up high, huh?   
Also, my ""aggressive turns"" were me simply driving out of parking lots onto busy streets with heavy oncoming traffic. No squealing tires or anything, but simply turning fast enough that I could join the traffic without slowing anyone down. It seems that's aggressive. Oh come on...

I think Tesla is rendering the term ""performance car"" fucking useless with this rating system. So now we should drive like retired people 'cause then we can keep the score of 100? My thinking is no. And that's gonna exclude me from having the FSD Beta then? Well they can kiss my...  
Am I the only one fuming about this?? 

Also, the computer that we're supposed to teach how to drive in real life conditions is the one judging us how we're driving? Isn't that kinda backwards? Am I overthinking? 

TL;DR: I'm pissed about the score system. Tesla forcing you to drive like a granny even though you have a performance car, just to test the FSD Beta.

TeslaMotors,hate,y3bg89,"As a non-Tesla EV owner, I now get it!","I get it.  I now understand why so many people are emphatically over the moon with their Tesla. I myself drive an Audi e-tron and my wife drives a Volvo XC60 PHEV, but over the past week we drove a Model Y Long Range over 850 miles while on vacation. We drove it in downtown urban areas, suburbs, on the interstate, on back country roads, a National Park, and even an international border. After driving the car for a week in many different types of driving scenarios, I can confidently say driving a Tesla is the most complete EV experience currently on the market. The key word here is EV, as the majority of my dislikes stem around the car part of the Y we rented. The EV/Software part of the Y was nearly a full chef's kiss. The only thing that really left a bad taste in my mouth was a few aspects of the auto-pilot (AP) system.

Things I loved:

* Plug and charge
* In car route planning with charging
* Showing how many spots were open at a Super Charger
* One pedal driving
* Amazing efficiency
* AP can find and maintain a lane like no other system I've used

Things that were neat:

* The slight delay before regen kicked in when coming off AP, giving you enough time to get your foot on the accelerator.
* The speed limit recognition system automatically converting KPH to MPH when driving into Canada.
* The charge door opening when pressing the button on the charger handle
* Being able to watch a Hulu show while waiting to board a car ferry.

Things I didn't really care for but wasn't a big deal

* The two step door handles were a little annoying
* The driving info on the left side of the screen was a little gimmicky. I would have preferred to have a full screen map then an animation of a semi-truck that was actually a car pulling a trailer.
* The vegan leather looked and felt cheap but the seats were ultimately comfortable to sit in for hours which is really what is important.
* No real-time visualization of traffic along the route. I'm fairly certain traffic was taken into account when route planning, but there is no indication I could find to show it on the map. Ultimately not a big deal since it really did seem like traffic was taken into account when creating a route.

Things I really didn't like

* The suspension is subpar. The Y really needs better suspension and maybe even an air suspension system. Once the roads start to get a little rough, the suspension really started to show its faults. It was fine on smooth roads though.
* Road noise is a problem. It gets loud in the cabin over 60 mph, especially if the road is not perfectly smooth.
* There were various squeaks and creaks when going over bumps and on rough roads.
* Looking at the map while driving was a bit of a neck stretch. Like I said before, it would have been nice to have a full screen map or at least have it positioned closer to the driver.
* There is no cruise control speed memory past being able to automatically set it at the speed limit (or X% past the speed limit)
* The torque sensor for AP is not very sensitive. Our Audi is capacitive but the Volvo uses a torque sensor and only takes the slightly nudge to recognize an input. I could wiggle the Y's steering wheel and nothing. I ended up just flicking the volume up and down in these cases which was a little annoying.

Things that drove me bonkers

* Adaptive cruise control is way too sensitive. I only had one phantom braking instance but there were many times I would pass a parked car, a cyclist, a runner, a car turning left in front of me, and a few other things that would trigger a panic brake scenario. Our Audi and Volvo do not have this problem.
* No blind spot monitoring system. I found Tesla's solution to blind spots more effort and increased the amount of time when my eyes were off the road. Almost every other manufacturer has a light on the mirror which lets you quickly look in your mirror and see if someone is in your blind spot simultaneously. It's a two step process in a Tesla and I found myself manually checking my blind spots in heavy traffic situations.
* AP disabling every single time I changed lanes. In moderate traffic, this became a nuisance every time I moved into the left lane to pass someone.
* Auto high beams when AP was enabled. I ended up blinding a bunch of people because this system is not up to snuff. Our Audi and Volvo do not have this problem. I eventually just turned AP off after getting flashed multiple times by oncoming cars.
* AP is an all or nothing system. It's great at maintaining your lane, but in the rare instance it didn't,  I wish the system would let you make a small correction instead of disabling altogether. It was very jerky and would fight me in those situations. It just didn't feel safe.

I do want to touch on AP one more time as I was blown away by how well it would maintain a lane. It didn't matter if it was a construction zone with a temporary lane made of cones or a twisty mountain road full of switch backs. The darn car would stay in the center of the lane and handle almost any turn no matter how tight. It truly is next level in this aspect. The big problem I had with AP was the ancillary systems around it that made the experience like monitoring a toddler. Frankly, AP is much more advanced than Audi or Volvo's system but the latter systems are so much more relaxing to use, especially on the interstate where lane markings are generally good.

Alright. If you have read this far you're probably thinking I hate the vehicle after how much complaining I did but that truly isn't the case. The things that made the Y great were weighted much higher than what wasn't so great. Point being, the EV/Software aspects of the car are so polished that I get how people are willing to overlook some of the things Tesla doesn't do well with. Would I buy one? IDK. Maybe. It's hard to say since we already have two nice cars, but at the very least I get what the hype is about. I'm also having a hard time adjusting to not having one pedal driving on my e-tron after spending a week with the Tesla so there is that. :)

It seems Tesla will want to focus primarily on the subscription model. This makes sense as the percentage of FSD package buyers must be minimal in comparison to potential customers willing to jump into a subscription model of FSD.

In my opinion going forward Tesla will probably want to eliminate the ability to buy FSD. I know they said otherwise but that is meaningless. Can you buy a lifetime subscription to netflix/phone/cable etc? The two options typically dont intertwine.

Tesla should ""reward"" the adoptors. The people who believed and funded FSD without anything to show for their huge investment. Rewards us with a licence.

TeslaMotors,hate,c9fpgv,How the Tesla Model 3 has Ruined Me,"&#x200B;

[Supercharging on the Way Home](https://preview.redd.it/uy11zpftgh831.jpg?width=4160&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3947e75dfd6c0767121845235a5973ed8e72ea2e)

In November last year I took delivery of my black, rear wheel drive, long range Tesla Model 3. I‚Äôd never driven in a Tesla before, much less driven one myself. Still, the lure of a 300+ mile range fully electric vehicle and the soon to be cut in half Federal tax credit swayed me and my wife to take the plunge. Six or so months and 11,000 miles later, the car has more or less ruined me on driving any other vehicle. The Model 3 does things that feel groundbreaking and paradigm shifting, and, even more amazingly, in a, ‚ÄúWhy hasn‚Äôt it always been this way,‚Äù sort of way.

1. Entry, exit, and control of the vehicle through the app is pretty much flawless (note: with a modern phone) and doesn't require a dedicated device. Walking up to the car with your enabled smartphone means getting in is as simple as pulling on the handle. Other cars have similar behaviors with key fobs, but who wants to carry anything else around when I already have a computer with all sorts of connectivity options sitting in my pocket? This is what Tesla has done; eliminated something I used to have to carry around. The funny thing is I never really thought much about carrying keys around until I didn‚Äôt have to do so anymore. Now that I don‚Äôt have to carry keys, when I drive my wife‚Äôs car I‚Äôm very aware that I have this other device in my pocket.
2. The acceleration is effortless, silent, and addicting. Seriously addicting. I came to the Tesla from an economy sedan, so the difference for me is greater than someone who may have had another performance luxury vehicle, but oh my God is the acceleration just lovely. Even better, it‚Äôs all so effortless. When I get in another vehicle now and put the pedal down it feels like everything is just working so hard to achieve what the Tesla does instantaneously and with almost no noise (just an appealing motor whine that reminds me of the Tumbler in stealth mode in the Nolan lead Batman series). When someone in a traditionally powered vehicle drives past with their engine roaring, it feels like such an anachronism now.
3. The entire braking system does things the right way. The magnetic braking means I typically only have to use my physical brakes at somewhere between 4 and 6 MPH to come to a complete stop, instead of braking the vehicle all the way down from 60 or 65 MPH, which will clearly create far more wear on the braking system. The magnetic braking was the thing I was most nervous about initially, having read stories of people coming to jerky stops when getting used to it. Those fears were entirely unfounded. Except for my first toll booth stop (which was hilariously about 15 feet too soon), I‚Äôve found it entirely intuitive and easy to get used to. Now, when I drive a different car and take my foot off the accelerator I‚Äôm cranky about the fact that I have to push the stupid brake pedal down (what is this, the 50s?) to really slow the car, instead of the car just doing it automatically.
4. Speaking of annoying things you just do in your car without thinking about it, how about turning the car on and off? The Tesla system to turn the car on (you really don't, but you get it ready to go by pushing the brake pedal with your phone in your pocket) and turn it off (you really don‚Äôt, just open the door) doesn‚Äôt need to be a Tesla only thing. Any car with a key fob could do both of these things, really. Why do they require me to push a different button? Speaking of that, the fact that the Tesla automatically locks the doors when you get out of range takes a little getting used to (there‚Äôs initially a fear it won‚Äôt work) but once you do it‚Äôs another one of those little things that all cars should just do, but for some reason don‚Äôt. Note, however, that getting used to this stuff means you‚Äôll probably leave your other cars running accidentally. My wife has caught me just hopping out of our other car a few times without shutting it off. Sorry, I thought this was 2019.
5. The minimal gauges was something I loved from the moment I sat in the car for the first time. It took about 10 minutes to get used to looking slightly right instead of slightly down for my speed, and (admittedly) about a week to get used to the lane obstacle detection in the same location, but it‚Äôs all so clean and tidy. The internal navigation is fantastic (and the 3D perspective it gives is a nice touch), and the infotainment system works well (generally). I was initially worried I‚Äôd hate not having SiriusXM (and honestly, I still think for this level of car it should be an option), but I ended up cancelling my app-based Sirius subscription about 2 months after getting the car because there are a ton of options built in for free. Getting into a more typical car now feels like information overload, with dozens of dials, gauges, and buttons competing for my attention, and LED light coming from every direction. Driving the Model 3, in particular at night, feels far more connected with the outside world because of the minimal distractions within the cabin.
6. What does gas cost right now? I honestly don‚Äôt know, but up until November I‚Äôd always had a sense of what it cost per gallon, because I was filling up every 6 days. Even better, my wife barely has to fill up more than once a month because on the weekends we pile all five of us into my car for basically every drive (us plus our three daughters). Our other vehicle (a Pacifica) is relegated to times where we both need to go somewhere or we‚Äôre driving a long enough distance that having three kids in the back is going to lead to arguments. Otherwise, even though the kids clearly have significantly more space in the minivan, they always want to drive in the Tesla. This gets me to another reason this car has ruined me on other cars. Sure, I need to charge, but I just plug in when I get home, and I head in to the house. No more freezing while pumping gas in the middle of February. Sure, I lost approximately 25% range in the Winter months due to the cold, but that‚Äôs not much of a problem when you can ‚Äúfill up‚Äù every night (scheduled to use off-peak electric prices) if you‚Äôre worried about your range, and the car is filling up while I‚Äôm reading, hanging out with the wife and kids, or sleeping.
7. How about service? I had a minor squeaking coming from the back wheels when reversing (common problem) and my horn would only sound when I pushed the right hand side (again, common). I scheduled service within the app for the nearest location, and then Tesla sent a message a few days later saying that these issues could be addressed by their mobile service system, so they drove to my house and did everything in my driveway. I didn‚Äôt need to go to some shop, sit in their waiting room for who knows how long, try to work using their wifi, etc. I just hung out at my house, doing what I usually would, and they fixed the two issues. Awesome.
8. Software updates are flawless and fast. You get notified on your phone that an update is available, click to start the update process, and then a little later get notified that the update is complete. By comparison, software updates in our Pacifica created a situation where climate control was broken for a month while they figured out what went wrong, and updating my old car required me to download images to a flash drive and sit with the car running for an hour while the update was applied. Updates are also super frequent and not insignificant in what they‚Äôre doing, including things like adding 5% more range to the car and better power (as if that was really necessary).

To be objective, however, there are some annoyances:

1. Voice control is still pretty limited. My 2012 Ford had better voice control options (voice and phrase detection was far worse in that car, which is pretty much flawless in the Tesla, but there were more phrases it would recognize), including some that I think are absolutely necessary, like, ‚ÄúCall Sarah on mobile.‚Äù Right now in the Tesla I can only say, ‚ÄúCall Sarah,‚Äù and it lists all the numbers I have for her in my contacts, which requires me to scroll to find the right one and tap on it on the display.
2. Speaking of phone control, the pick up / hang up options should be able to be ‚Äútapped‚Äù through the steering wheel buttons.
3. Cell connectivity sometimes just flakes out for the in-car infotainment. I park underground at work, so the car won‚Äôt have LTE coverage in the garage, but it also seems to just lose the ability to reconnect when I come back up above ground (probably weekly). A couple of times a month it seems to require a soft reboot to get it to reconnect to LTE.
4. The piano black plastic covers for the center console area are scratch and dust magnets. I tried to wrap them but messed it up the first time so I haven‚Äôt tried again. Still, for an expensive car I‚Äôd think they‚Äôd have a nicer setup in such a prominent area. It‚Äôs pretty clear this is a common complaint when center console wraps are such a common purchase for Model 3 owners.

Two other points worth mentioning quickly:

1. This car is more contagious than a yawn at the DMV. A friend and my parents both bought Model 3s after driving in mine basically once. It‚Äôs that nice. It‚Äôs that different.
2. I recently got back from a 3.5 hour drive in our other car (family vacation), and I immediately volunteered to go get groceries, just so I could drive the Tesla. Usually the last thing I‚Äôd want to do is drive more after a long drive. Instead, it just highlighted the advantages of the Tesla.

So, that‚Äôs it at a high level. The Model 3 has ruined me on other cars, and it has done so by concentrating on the everyday aspects of car driving. In the Kano model, it has basically added delighters and performance features that everyone else is just checking the box on. It takes a lot of things we just take for granted as ‚Äúthe way it‚Äôs done,‚Äù and reimagined them in a way that feels like it‚Äôs redefining what driving should be in the 21st century.

Almost every car available is great at something and is a good choice for someone. Just because it's not a good choice for you doesn't mean it's a a bad car.

But more importantly for me is the insult to the people who make them. It takes thousands of people many years of their lives to build these cars. Many lose their families through divorce or just lose the connection with their kids while away on new model launch. Some people lose their lives setting up the factory.  I personally can attribute the loss of my fiance to a particular SUV. So when someone just writes it off without ever even sitting in it... I get a tad frustrated.

For me, it has not done anything to improve the car and has in fact broken a number if things.  I am not a fan of the interface at all.  Too many features have been removed without gaining anything. I miss the speedometer, the date and time in the driver's display.  I have over 1/3 of that display showing me a picture of my car.  I bought the car....I know what it looks like.  On the 17inch screen, when I am navigating to a destination, it will no longer show the blue line indicating the route.  This is insanely frustrating. I only had the car about 2 months before 7.0 was released, but I miss 6.2 so much.  It was well thought out and designed and everything just worked.  I am aware auto pilot is revolutionary, but for those of us who don't have it, it just seems like the new software is change for the sake of change and ruined many things in the process.  

On another note, I live in Oregon and as we enter the rainy season these have to be the worst automatic windshield wipers.  They are so delayed in both settings, waiting for a solid layer if water to accumulate before activating.  It is actually a safety hazard.

TeslaMotors,hate,gysero,4 things my BMW 5 series did better than my M3P...,"So I've officially completed just over a month with my M3P and I'm in love. As a daily commuter, it's just brilliant. Simple, comfortable, and very satisfying to drive.

With that said, there are a few things that seem glaringly inferior when compared to my previous experience with BMW. Full disclosure: I'm a car fanatic, and pledge loyalty to no brand. I love cars for what they are and rotate through new cars every 12-16 months or so because I love to try new things. There's no hate to Tesla here, just some observations on what I think could be easily improved via software.

**1. Deactivating the car alarm is an utter FAIL.**

So using your mobile phone (iPhone 11 Pro here) as the car's key is brilliant. While it isn't perfect and can take a moment to connect via Bluetooth when approaching the car sometimes, it's mostly pretty flawless. I really enjoy the experience. It's something I love, *except* when the alarm unintentionally goes off.

One really poor example is when I went into a restaurant to grab take-out while my wife and 2 young daughters stayed in the car. I set HVAC to stay on and brought my phone in with me for mobile payments. As I was returning to my car my wife opened the passenger door to grab the food from me. But because my phone hadn't connected via Bluetooth yet, her opening the door triggered the alarm by opening the door from within.

This immediately triggered the alarm. 

If you haven't experienced the alarm, here's a quick synopsis of what its like. It's ALARMING ;)

Now imagine what it's like being inside the car still.

Heavy metal Bach music is blaring at 5000% volume, and there is NO obvious way to minimize the volume (due to lack of volume knob like a traditional car). I mean I get that it makes sense to add it because its the alarm, but seriously, it was dangerously loud for an adult, let alone a very young child inside the car.

Of course, anyone standing in front of their car is going to feel befuddled as they grope around their pockets for their key to disable the alarm only to remember that your phone is your key. Now you have to grab your phone, unlock it, open the Tesla app, and then ""unlock"" your car, all while your occupants are having their eardrums melted by the ""modern"" theft-deterrent system blasting heavy metal at 5000% volume. A ""traditional"" car could be deactivated by jamming a button on your key fob while the keys are still in your pocket. As a first-time Tesla phone-key alarm deactivator, there was simply NO warning or preparation for this kind of experience. Totally not cool. 

This seems like a glaring oversight. Not only was it an embarrassing experience for me and my family, but also any bystander who doesn't appreciate Teslas would be watching as music is blasting and thinking ""why the heck would I want my car to do that?"" Worse though, what if there was an infant in their car seat while my wife was also in the car? That could cause literal physical damage to a very young baby and there is NO apparent way to turn off any alarm quickly.

Serious fail. C'mon Elon.

* There has to be a better way to deactivate the alarm, or, proactively determine what sets off an alarm. For the latter, why can't it use the seat sensors to sense whether someone is in the car? Or the internal camera? Or use the HVAC setting to leave it ""On"" when I leave the car (or combination of both) to predict that someone may still be in the car. Or best yet, once the phone has connected via Bluetooth, deactivate the alarm. Or a push notification on my phone pops up to deactivate quickly. Finally, a deactivation method to type in a 4-digit pin on the screen would have been VERY helpful in this situation. But without any warning, the pin may not have been super obvious.

While I love the Model 3s minimalism and simplicity, there doesn't seem to be enough oversight on this functionality and how one would want disarm false alarms. It made me embarrassed to own a Tesla to say the least, and the 5 people watching us nearby were probably assuming that Tesla drivers love blasting annoying music and pissing everyone off around them.

**2. Remind the driver that they left their phone in the wireless charging tray.**

It's only been a month, but I've left my phone in the charging tray at least a dozen times now after leaving the car. Since I use the phone as my key, this is kind of a problem. My (18+) BMW M5 would notify me on the dash, and with an audible signal, that a phone is in the charging tray whenever I put it into park and opened the driver's door.

Considering that the UI notifies me when I'm closing the center console too hard (and it not sticking), I think this is a simple request.

* PLEASE, can you just set up a UI reminder that I have a phone to grab, especially because it is THE KEY? You could even make it a toggle in case people don't like it.

**3. Tesla is known for its automated (or semi-automated) driving capabilities, but my BMW was superior in two simple ways.**

When activated on the freeway, my BMW seemed far more ""simple"" in its semi-automated driving. 

First, the steering wheel resistance amount required on my M3P to not trigger a ""warning, hands on the wheel"" seems far too little on the M3P. I'll have my hands on the wheel and it won't detect them. While that is kind of annoying, it gets worse when you apply some resistance and accidentally kick it out of autopilot.

Second, the more frustrating part, is that once you ""kick it out of autopilot"", you have to manually reactivate it. My BMW would automatically turn back on once you put your hands on the wheel, and, even after changing lanes. It would stay on completely until you turned it off. 

When I change lanes in the M3P, it deactivates autopilot and then you have to turn it back on. It gets old after about 3 times of doing this and then you just don't want to use the feature anymore because of how annoying it is.

* Allow Autopilot to turn back on after a lane change. I don't want to have to think about Autopilot again when I feel the need to take over the car temporarily. 

Thirdly, the reactivity of the active cruise control to decelerate when approaching a car in front seems far more excessive than the BMW did. It will decelerate in a much more extreme way and is quite jarring in some instances. This would require a more refined sensitivity level, but, just my opinion on this last one.

**4. Allow users to adjust the lower UI controls.**

I think the UI in the M3 is far superior than the MS I drove in 2018. The always-on controls on the bottom of the screen are helpful, but I would LOVE the ability to customize them.

Two things I will likely never use in AZ: the front or rear defroster, and the seat heaters. That takes up valuable UI space for something I would rather have: 1) rear HVAC on/off, 2) Fan speed (non auto mode), 3) other.

For #1, since I live in AZ, the AC will be used basically ever day for 9 months. I would love a quick toggle to turn the rear AC on and off. Sometimes I have the kiddos with me, sometimes I don't. Right now I leave it always on so I don't have to mess with it, but obviously that uses more energy than needed. This would be quite welcome.

For #2, when in auto mode, the fan speeds adjust based on the thermostat setting. But if you don't want it in auto, then you have to enter the additional HVAC menu and make adjustments there. I'd love to manually control fan speed from the lower permanent UI than having to go into a menu.

For #3, I love seeing the energy consumption graph. Not a deal breaker that it takes 2 taps to get there, but I'll never use the heated seats or front/rear defroster icons. I don't need those taking up 20% of icon space, especially when I accidentally turn on the heated seat when reaching for the HVAC temp control.

* Suggestion: allow users to edit the lower UI icons. Take a play from Apple (or any other smartphone) and allow your main buttons to be customizable. The Macbook's Touch Bar is completely customizable and has a very intuitive interface to do so.

TeslaMotors,hate,y2bwo8,Things I wish my Model 3 had,"I have a 2020 M3P with over 50K miles on it and have driving across the USA several times and here is what I'd like to see in no specific order or priority:

\- Bring back radar, Vision SUCKS. Way more phantom braking events, and autopilot slows down in foggy conditions when with radar it did not. Also, radar would show cars in front of me 2 or 3 deep, now with vision, all I see is the one in front on my visualization screen. Although, vision seems to do a better job at lane-keeping. So, a hybrid radar/vision might be best. It‚Äôs so bad that I rarely use autopilot anymore because when I do, I‚Äôm always on edge, ready to unintentionally brake check someone at a moment‚Äôs notice. You know a function is badly designed when the user is incentivized to NOT use that function. One of the biggest reasons I and probably most people bought Tesla was because of autopilot, and now it‚Äôs degraded to the point of not using it. 

\- Implement a dumb cruise control that only keeps the speed constant like every other car. I don't want phantom braking and making people angry behind me who think I brake checked them, I don't want to slow down in foggy conditions or around curves, I don't want lane keeping, I don't want distance keeping, I don't want 85 MPH to be my top limit. I just want the speed kept constant as if I had my foot on the accelerator and nothing else. 

\- Allow switching of accelerations speeds by tapping the ""chill"" word, just like tapping the battery changes it from % to miles. Or have different driving profiles available at the tap of a button, like the M buttons on BMW M cars. I don‚Äôt want to change my entire Driver profile to do this. 

\- Fix the music UI where half the song's name and band can't be seen even though there is plenty of real estate in the music bar. Show the time/time remaining in the song instead of just having the status bar at the bottom. 

\- Allow us to turn on/off the driver and passenger HVAC independently. I know you can change temps on both sides independently, but sometimes I just want mine on when there is not passenger or when my passenger doesn't want air in their face without having to change the direction of the air flow every time. 

\- Speaking of HVAC, for the love of God get rid of that stupid SLIDER to change fan speed. It‚Äôs thin and very hard to use while driving. It obviously didn‚Äôt go through real world driving tests. Go back to having large + or ‚Äì buttons to change it. In fact, make all buttons large and easily accessible and get rid of any sliders anywhere. 

\- Get rid of the auto-wipers and auto-high beams when in autopilot. I hate when I have no control over functions of the car. If vision requires both to be on, then vision isn't good. Go back to radar and keep ultrasonics. 

\- If possible, give the M3P a slight acceleration boost, even if at the top end. There used to be a large gap between the M3P and M3LR, which is what distinguished the two and why people paid a premium for it. Track mode is a nice distinction, but not enough. The acceleration boost for the LR was a money grab and diminished the value of the M3P. I know they don't want to eat into Model S sales, but people who get the Model S/X are probably more into the luxury aspect that pure speed (I could be wrong). 

\- Go back to the Apple IOS style UI/Icons and not this Android looking one. It doesn't fit the aesthetic of the car. 

\- Allow customization of how many ""clicks"" a turn signal includes. 3 is way too short

\- Allow us to have different ‚Äústyles‚Äù of UI. For example, I could have a Road-trip style, which increases the map size and gets rid of the 3D car animation. I could have a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù style, which shows speed and gear and that‚Äôs it. You get the idea. Many cars do this already by emphasizing speed, or RPMs, or oil pressures, etc. on their digital displays with the click of a button. 

\- In addition to Chill/Normal/Sport/Ludicrous modes, have a purely ECO one where all but necessary functions are turned off to maximize range and efficiency. 

\- It was nice allowing us to change the color of our 3D model, but if we added assets for aftermarket taillights or other wheels, that would be cool. It could even be something others create, and we can upload via thumb drive. It‚Äôs weird to see my 3D model with the wrong wheels and taillights since I got both replaced. 

\- Why is the walk-away door lock sound the horn honking? Tesla‚Äôs have external speakers, so make it a pleasant locking sound like other EVs do and not this loud obnoxious honk. Even the reverse humming sound is more pleasant than the honk. I hate coming home at night to my apartment and having my car honk. I could turn off the walk-away door honk, but that isn‚Äôt the point. I shouldn‚Äôt have to not use a function because it sucks. That is indicative of the function itself needing fixing. 

\- Allow retrofitting for powered frunk/trunks, new center console, heated steering wheels, and other upgrades just like they are doing with the CCS adapter. In fact, my Tesla SC is installed the newer side repeaters because I asked them to. They don‚Äôt suffer from the blinkers blinding them at night and have better low-light visibility. It‚Äôs a $350 retrofit though. 

\- Tesla needs to be more open to and more responsive when allowing other auto shops to buy Tesla parts. My go-to auto guy could not get certain parts from Tesla SC no matter how many times he reached out. But when I scheduled an appointment with the SC, they magically had the parts ready to go. 

\- STOP removing functions in a car I already paid for. This is the double-edged sword of OTA updates. We get more cool features and more power, but on the flip side, we lose some functionality like radar and ultrasonics. Imagine buying a cellphone with certain functions and later the manufacturer removes some of those functions even with the necessary hardware still installed. Now imagine some of those functions were big reasons you bought the cellphone. And you have no say in rejecting these updates or risk being out of warranty. Totally unacceptable for a $50k plus car. 

\- If Tesla removes features in an update, they should refund the owner for said removed functions. Like removing Alcantara headliner on later Model 3s. Now it‚Äôs this cheap beige fabric garbage. Not ‚Äúluxury‚Äù at all. Or removing radar/ultrasonics. I paid for that hardware and functionality and dammit I want to use it. 

\- Why are some features on my state-of-the-art electric vehicle not available that are available on some other cheap cars? Ventilated seats? 360-degree vision? Lowering the sound when a phone call comes in? 

\- Need more factory paint options. 9/10 Teslas I see on the road are white and it‚Äôs so damn boring and monotonous. Wraps are expensive and don‚Äôt last forever. A full paint job is even more expensive. 

Overall, amazing car in its totality, literally revolutionary. I know all the above fixes can‚Äôt and likely won‚Äôt be changed, but you never know. Some might be hardware and software limited in some way I‚Äôm not aware of, but then again, I‚Äôm not a Tesla engineer. This is coming from purely a user experience perspective.

TeslaMotors,hate,9q2pdg,Conclusion after 2000km driven 99% on AP1: I f.. hate the nagging,"Might sound like a rant but it isn‚Äôt. It might sound like a first world problem but isn‚Äôt. I just paid a lot of cash for this car and I want to be able to make use of the functionality I paid for, without having to constantly babysit the steering wheel (I know, that‚Äôs called driving). 

Since last update, the nagging of AP is really frustrating to the point I am not using it anymore.

I am driving mostly on German Autobahn at maximum speed allowed by AP1 which is 150km/h (90mi/h) with my hands ALWAYS on the steering wheel.

I am keeping my hands at 7 & 5 o‚Äôclock on the steering wheel (that‚Äôs how I drive most comfortable) but the weight of my hands is not enough to stop the AP nagging every 10-12 seconds. Also keeping my hand on top of the steering wheel at 12 o‚Äôclock doesn‚Äôt help. On a road trip of 2000km that takes about 28hours to complete, that‚Äôs a lot of unnecessary nagging every 10 seconds, it just becomes less tiring and annoying to just drive myself rather than moving the steering wheel left and right just to make the AP happy.

Another thing I can‚Äôt bend my brain around is: Why do I need to lose my AP if I drove 1km/h harder than the AP limit? What is the logic? Sometimes I need to floor it a bit so I can complete my overtake and make room for a faster car coming from behind. This maneuver gets me to 151km/h and always renders the AP useless until I find a gas station to stop and start again. Why not deactivate it for 1 or 2 minutes? Why the drastic punishment?

Can we somehow express our group opinion about this directly to Elon? I am sure I am not the only one frustrated with this.

All these aside Autopilot is by far the best and most underrated feature of this car.

Edit: Managed to cut the nags in half by changing the steering mode from standard to comfort.

TeslaMotors,hate,ewo5kz,Announcing: teslabout open beta,"&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/71cp749744e41.jpg?width=3751&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9906bb3766cff32fc8f350f4e902f2a71c26f9a7

Hey Tesla fam,

Joey from teslabout here. My friend and I have been hard at work over the past 6 months creating [https://teslabout.com](https://teslabout.com). After months in closed beta, we are excited to announce the start of open beta today.

Teslabout is a modern web application for viewing live and historical metrics for your tesla(s). We enjoyed using other services such as teslafi and teslascope and they inspired us to build atop that idea to create a mobile first design. Below are some key features.

**Visually designed for all screens**

We‚Äôre a bit obsessed with our Teslas and metrics so we wanted a way to always be able to view them. Whether that means we‚Äôre at our desks in front of giant monitors or if we‚Äôre just in a restaurant making sure the car is locked, we made sure teslabout looks stunning on all screens. Here‚Äôs a gallery: [https://imgur.com/a/CF5z2Rz](https://imgur.com/a/CF5z2Rz).

**Commands**

One of the goals we had for making a mobile first application was to mostly replace the official Tesla app. We hated waking the car by simply opening the app or having to wait 30 seconds with the app open before we could turn on climate control. We have a command palette embedded in the dashboard that you can just press and go, no need to wait for the car to wake up first.

**Metrics**

We love metrics. We love them so much we couldn‚Äôt fit everything we wanted to trend on one screen. To solve this, we decided to create a fully custom trend tool that gives the user full control. You want to trend kwh consumption vs temperature? You got it. You want to trend odometer against battery max range against drive efficiency? No problem. You can even pick your own time range to trend against.

**Data importing**

Like many of you, we‚Äôve used a number of different services and wanted a way to aggregate all of our data so we could see it anytime. You can import data right from your settings dashboard.

**Trips, charges, and locations**

Driving and charging your Tesla is a huge part of its day. We track all of these with aggregated metrics for each trip and charge including efficiency, cost, and savings (vs ICE).

**International friendly**

Whether you like metrics, imperial, or something in between we‚Äôve got you covered with granular unit of measure preferences. We even have support for 15 different currencies.

**Security**

This one is a given. Nobody wants their stuff hacked. We took multitudes of steps here. You never have to give us your Tesla email and password. The tokens are all we need. If you decide to use your Tesla email and password, we never store them All sensitive data (tokens, passwords, etc.) are encrypted or (salted +) hashed before storage. All data is encrypted while in flight. 2 factor authentication. Secured user sessions to prevent session hijacking

**PWA friendly**

We don‚Äôt quite have the resources as 2 devs with full time jobs to create fully native applications but we did ensure that teslabout is PWA friendly and performs as if it were native.

It‚Äôs free to signup over at [https://teslabout.com/landing](https://teslabout.com/landing) and for those interested, we have a FAQ page here: [https://teslabout.com/faq](https://teslabout.com/faq).

We also have a paid tier ($5/mo/vehicle) for those interested in historical data or just want to support us. I took the day off from work so that I could stick around to answer any questions so ask away!

Update 1: We pushed a more relaxed password requirement.

Update 2: Made minor fixes to account registration and uom preferences. More uom fixes on the way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ewo5kz/announcing_teslabout_open_beta/,teslabout,1170.0,0.9949
TeslaMotors,hate,fdqbfm,Model 3 Standard Range blew me away..,"I know I am extremely late on this but I finally decided to test drive the Model 3 SR+ and it completely shocked me. I have been following Tesla for years and heard numerous stories about how amazing the car is but nothing could come close to the first time I put my foot down on the pedal.. that was THE best feeling I've felt in awhile. One of the things I've always hated about ICE cars is the delayed throttle response and lack of acceleration no matter which car I drove..people told me about the instant throttle response, torque, etc but I think it's something you can't truly know unless you drive the car. I still cannot believe that the car I drove is the slowest trim of the Model 3 lol I can't even fathom how quick the performance version would be. One thing I know for sure is that my next car will be a Tesla 1000000%.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/fdqbfm/model_3_standard_range_blew_me_away/,[unknown],,0.4

TeslaMotors,hate,17haazu,1 month in on Tesla ownership...,"So I've been a Nissan customer for years, and when I went to lease my new Maxima, they wanted 675 a month with 1,000 down. I went to a friend that owned a Chevy dealership and the prices were not much better. As a joke, I called Tesla dealership near me and they explained I had to get the app.

48 hours later I was at the dealership picking up my new Tesla.  Never once have I drove or even sat inside the car for a ride.  Just bought it blind and showed up to pick it up.  I LOVED buying a car without slimy sales people, but was scared I made a mistake not even test driving or seeing the car I bought in advance.

Well, it's been a month and here are my thoughts:

1) In most ways, this Tesla (Model 3 base) is the coolest car I've ever had. It has more features than my previous Nissan Maxima Platinum decked out car. I love the app controls (which Nissan also charged a ton extra for and did less). It is like driving  a car of the future...I previously owned 3 different Nissan 350/370z's and this car is equally as fast as any of them.

2) Gas vs Electric.  Because of where I live (apartment) I'm forced to use supercharging stations.  There are a couple nearby which makes it easy.  I HATE the fact that it auto sets it to 80 percent charge and you have to override it manually.  I once ate some ""idle"" fees while at 80 percent which I feel is unethical as I would have been back in time if they actually charged me to 100. I know I can override it, but to make me pay more while not charging me to full is a joke. 

Also, while on this topic, I have saved zero dollars switching from gas to electric.  This is not only confirmed from my bank statements, but the Tesla App on my phone confirms that my ""savings"" are 0 dollars.  My job is only 4.7 miles away yet regardless of how careful and slow I drive, the battery always goes down at least 8 or 9 miles to get to work. Something seems defective or dishonest here...

3) Trunk.  For some reason I can not figure out how to open my trunk without going into the App.  I keep the credit card key in my wallet, but why the hell can't I just press the button on my trunk to open it when close??  Ok, this one is petty....but still annoying and I'm sure I'm doing something wrong lol.

4) Toughness:  A full grown deer rammed into the side of my car out of nowhere last week.  I mean, it full out hit me from the side and I was convinced there was a bowling ball sized crater in my passenger side door.  The Tesla camera (really awesome!) caught the deer hitting me, and the rear cam caught the deer rolling behind my car after impact.  Don't worry, I went back and the deer was fine.  Even more impressive, my car hardly had a scratch from that massive impact.  You can tell where it hit if you look close....but no serious damage at all!

I love the car and feel like I'm driving in the future.  I'm sure I'll discover even more cool tricks as time goes on.  I'm just a little bummed out about not saving more money for electric.

Also, what is the deal with no spare tire? If you get a random flat you just sit there on the side of the road until help arrives to tow your car??? Was this car built for a generation that isn't able to change a tire? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/17haazu/1_month_in_on_tesla_ownership/,CastingObsidian,278.0,0.9724

TeslaMotors,hate,1864wq2,"My thoughts on upgrading from a 2022 Model 3 Performance to a Model S (standard, not Plaid)","TLDR; If you are driving a Model 3 Performance, the base Model S with standard wheels is a *very* nice upgrade.

Context: I had a 2019 Model 3 Performance. Loved it. It was leased, so switched to a 2022 Model 3 Performance. The 2019 had better fit and finish than the 2022. The 2022's battery also degraded faster than the older car. I probably lucked out and got a peach 2019, but whatever. Both cars were excellent fun. That said, the crashy suspension was starting to annoy me, and I wanted more range. So got a base 2023 Model S with the standard wheels for range and comfort. Ordered Midnight Silver, it got changed to Stealth Grey.

So here are my thoughts on the differences between a Model 3 Performance and a standard Model S:

 - The Model S is much better looking (duh).
 - The fit and finish is pretty good - the panel gaps are a little wider than I would like, but I don't have any alignment issues. It is better than the Model 3 - my Model 3's trunk was slightly out of square, causing a slight jiggle when closing.
 - The initial paint quality is excellent. So was the Model 3. As to how it holds up over time, I do not know. I have PPF on the front.
 - The performance is similar. I know it is supposed to be a bit faster (same 0 to 60, but the Model S measures it without the 1 foot rollout) but the difference is too small to notice. They are both so, so fast.
 - The handling is good, but I can feel that the car is larger to drive. I have to pay a bit more attention to keep the car centered in the lane and when turning. As for actual handling, I don't drive at the limit, so both seem equally capable to me.
 - The S is *much* more comfortable! I knew that going in, but the difference is pretty stark. Now, I probably would have had better comfort if I had the standard wheels on my Model 3 rather than the larger performance wheels, but I still think the S is more comfortable.
 - The S is much quieter inside. Much less noise coming in from the outside. Overall just a nicer, more comfortable, quieter cabin.
 - Having the front instrument panel made zero difference to my life. I have no idea why auto journalists whine about needing a front IP.
 - I like the new gear selecting mechanism. The sliding up and down on the center panel is actually not bad at all. I was worried that I would hate it (I am a shorter person and worried about having to continuously reach for it) but no, works fine. Coupled with the automatic gear selection (where the car guesses the gear it should be in) it's a good solution. The *only* time I struggle is when I reverse in a parking lot, then have to reach over and move the slider up to move forward. That adds a couple hundred milliseconds to that process. On the whole I would still prefer a stalk but I feel like do get something with the new system.
 - Having the turning indicator buttons on the steering wheel is stupid, unsafe and aggravating to use. Using the buttons when you are driving straight and want to make a turn is simple. Anything else is hard to do because the buttons move with the wheels, which means you are never sure where they are. If you need to make several turns and lane changes in succession it is very disorienting and you end up clicking the wrong button or missing it entirely. The first company to offer a kit to add a turning stalk is getting my money. Honestly Tesla needs to retrofit these cars with a stalk. And bonus issue. When you are changing lanes, the signal automatically turns off after one lane change. So if you are making 2 lane changes in quick succession you *have* to use the turn signal twice. This whole thing is the single stupidest thing about this car. Comparing this to the Model 3 is moot, since the new Model 3 is getting the same garbage system.
 - The luggage space is better in the Model S. The trunk, the space under the trunk and the frunk are all larger.
 - I really like the center console - the multiple sliding mechanisms work well and help keep your stuff organized.
 - The carpets are plusher. Getting all weather mats so this really doesn't matter much to me.
 - Just overall the cabin is a nice upgrade over the Model 3 - all the materials seem a touch better.
 - Really like the rotating feature of the center screen. I have it oriented towards the driver and it does make a difference.
 - The larger screen is nice, but the Model 3 was pretty excellent in this regard as well.
 - The sound system in the Model 3 was very good, the one in the Model S is better.

TeslaMotors,hate,hfaawk,Is Tesla right to hold out on CarPlay and Android Auto integration?,"I know, I know, the predominant opinion here is that Tesla's infotainment system is so wrapped up into the car, that a system like CarPlay wouldn't be able to replace it. I'm aware the screen is used for integral car functions, and that the navigation is aware of your charge level and routes you to Superchargers. However, CarPlay and Android Auto are becoming better at a rate Tesla won't be able to compete.

&#x200B;

**Things Tesla will never be able to compete with:**

* 3rd Party App Support: Apple recently allowed more types of apps to integrate with CarPlay, including Parking and Food Ordering Apps.  Apple already allows audio and messaging apps as well. This means I can use WhatsApp, Overcast, Audible, Spotify, and much more, without having to touch my phone. Soon, Starbucks will probably be added to that list. You can also use other navigation apps like Waze, that provide features Tesla does not, like police warnings. Even \*if\* Tesla allows 3rd Party apps, if you are a developer, it won't be worth having resources allocated to Tesla's proprietary system when CarPlay and Android Auto cover 99% of cars.
* 1st Party Phone Integration: With CarPlay and Android Auto, your phone integrates completely. Siri and Google Assistant work quickly, and can actually show you things instead of relying on audio only. You can run Siri Shortcuts. Things like Calendar appointments and iOS location sharing all work from CarPlay. Tesla will never be able to have this level of integration.

CarPlay doesn't need to take over the whole screen- many manufactures have CarPlay and their own system coexist. Nearly every manufacturer has caved an added it. From the most luxurious brands, to the most economical, CarPlay and Android Auto are becoming [ubiquitous](https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/available-models/). I think Tesla's [NIH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here) Behavior can't last forever.

Edit: To all those saying they hate CarPlay and AA, and they don‚Äôt want it... well what about making it an option, like BMW or Mercedes? Implementing the API would be relatively simple for a company Tesla‚Äôs size.

TeslaMotors,hate,7pomtp,Tesla Model 3 Alcantara controversy explained,"TLDR: Model 3 with PUP has no longer Alcantara because of supplier issues. 

&nbsp;

**What happened?**

Tesla changed the Alcantara headliner to cloth in Model 3s that have the $5,000 Premium Upgrades Package (PUP). Tesla's Model 3 photos on their website still show Alcantara. They didn't say anything about this change. Some buyers found out about it yesterday (9 Jan 2018) when they went to pick up their new Model 3. All Model 3 production is now textile. Apparently, Tesla has problems with the supplier. The following was posted today (10 Jan) on TMC [here](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/2505472/).

>Well I've had my S for over 2yrs now. I was picking it up from service. But better late than never, right? Anyway, I talked to a couple of people regarding the Alcantara issue. One person explained to me that they had a supplier that stopped talking to them (Tesla) after about 2,000 vehicles. 

&nbsp;

**What is Alcantara?**

It's a suede-like synthetic material that looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/7QWQjUk.jpg). See the Wikipedia page [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcantara_(material).

&nbsp;

**Where does Tesla use Alcantara in the Model 3?**

Check out the image [here](https://i.imgur.com/Mw9eSpQ.jpg). They use it on the headliner, pillars, sun visors and door liners. The door liners have black Alcantara while the rest is light grey. 

&nbsp;

**Did Tesla advertise the Model 3 with Alcantara?**

* Yes. [This](https://i.imgur.com/q4WPuk1.jpg) photo was one of Tesla's presskit photos. [Dailymail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4747280/Elon-Musk-unveils-Tesla-Model-3-interior-no-dashboard.html), [Businessinsider](http://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-model-3-first-drive-2017-7?r=US&IR=T), [Fortune](http://fortune.com/2017/07/29/tesla-model-3-handover/), [TheVerge](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/29/16060330/tesla-model-3-production-release-date-price-controls-2017), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-31/driving-tesla-s-model-3-changes-everything), [Cleantechnica](https://cleantechnica.com/2017/08/06/tesla-model-3-vs-22-competitors-straight-specs/), [Jalopnik](https://jalopnik.com/the-tesla-model-3-long-range-trim-can-go-310-miles-on-a-1797356952) run articles using that photo. You can access Tesla's presskit using the link and password on the right side-panel [here](https://www.tesla.com/presskit).
* [This](https://www.tesla.com/configurator/compositor/?model=m3&view=STUD_SEAT&size=1900&file_type=jpg&options=PPSB) photo in the Model 3 configurator shows Alcantara. Also see [this](https://i.imgur.com/jS5gMus.png) screenshot from the configurator. 
* However, the description for Premium Upgrades Package doesn't specifically mention Alcantara. It says, ""premium materials throughout"". See the first bullet point item on the left side [here](https://youtu.be/kzAg5O-NzVY?t=205).

&nbsp;

**When did this change happen?**

The change in the production line must have happened in the last 5-7 days considering that the first reports emerged yesterday (9 Jan) [here](https://forums.tesla.com/forum/forums/what-happened-alcantara-headliner). The Model 3's delivered until yesterday had Alcantara.

&nbsp;

**What is the problem?**

Tesla was advertising (and still does) the Alcantara headliner in their photos. Model 3's delivered until yesterday had Alcantara. It was the only option. The $5,000 PUP says ""premium materials throughout"". All Model 3 review videos until now showed Alcantara. Buyers had a reasonable expectation to have Alcantara in their Model 3. 

&nbsp;

**What are some of the notable reactions?**

* [voip-ninja](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/2504042/): What are they going to put in the standard version to justify that the PUP is upgraded, linoleum?
* [Brandon332](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/2505366/): I've defended Tesla to the end of the earth, but for what it's worth, I am completely let down in this case.
* [MotoEvCA](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/2505430/): Many lady friend passengers of mine like the feel of Alcantara. They can tell the difference when they touch it. Tesla needs to make this right.
* [garywallace](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/2505511/): To me, this is a major disappointment.
* [insaneoctane](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/2505634/): Totally disappointed. Totally unacceptable.

&nbsp;

**What should Tesla do?**

They should start making the Model 3 without PUP and use the textile material for that. There are plenty of people waiting in line to get the Model 3 LR without PUP.

**Update 1:** Here is Tesla's statement and my comments:

>As we continue to increase production of Model 3 and produce more high-quality cars for customers, all Model 3 vehicles are being made with the same premium textile headliner found in our flagship Model S and Model X vehicles, ... [Source](https://electrek.co/2018/01/11/tesla-updates-model-3-interior-new-material/)

This could mean one of two things: 
~~1. The Model 3 with PUP will have a textile headliner like the Model S/X without PUP.~~ [see the next update]
2. The Model S/X with PUP have also just lost out on Alcantara.

&nbsp;

>... which has always been planned at this stage of production. [Source](https://electrek.co/2018/01/11/tesla-updates-model-3-interior-new-material/)

The photos [here](https://imgur.com/a/t8Upe) show a newly delivered Model 3 with textile sun visors but the vanity mirror flaps are still Alcantara. This doesn't look like a planned change. It looks more like they suddenly lost the supplier and scrambled to find an alternative.

&nbsp;

**Update 2:** /u/teslafolife has received the following communication from Tesla:

>Alcantara is no longer available. Right now we are producing our vehicles with the premium textile headliner! All of our S, X, and 3s from now on will have this textile headliner! Apologies for the confusion earlier! [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/7pqa7u/no_tesla_did_not_stop_using_alcantara_on_the/dsj68t0/)

This shows that Alcantara was just discontinued for the Model S/X with PUP too. Another person reported the same thing [here](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/2506923/).

TeslaMotors,hate,4e09df,"I Love the Model 3, but I Hate the New Screen.","   I am 6'3"" and in every car (pretty much ever) that I have sat in, my knees span out a bit to either side of the steering wheel. Looking at the pictures and videos of the Model 3, I am concerned that I would hit my right knee on the screen.
  Additionally, not making it flush with the dash just looks silly IMO. It looks like an early wall mounted flat screen TV with the silly little mount sticking out of the dash. It looks a bit flimsy.

   What are your thoughts? For me, this is a much bigger issue than pretty much everything else (like the size of the trunk), since it is the main interface with the car.

TeslaMotors,hate,8v230v,"[Discussion] Front motor whine, what is it, how bad is it, and am I going to hate driving with it?","First off, this is not a 'Tesla bash' post.  Please don't down vote because you think i'm trying to crap on Tesla.  I'm not.

I just configured a Model 3 AWD and now I'm having second thoughts because I saw this post:  https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/8utoc0/discussion_any_current_model_3_owners_feel_bummed/e1i8ws0/

I've searched more on this, and I haven't seen much except it appears to do with the front motor and shows up after some time and is pretty prevalent.  Its just ""a thing"".


I currently own a KIA SoulEV and it has an incessant whine with harmonics at 4k, 8k, plus a few others clearly visible on a spectrum using an app like Oxford Spectrum View (http://www.oxfordwaveresearch.com/products/spectrumviewapp/).  Its like driving with built in tinnitus.   

I didn't discover this before I picked the car up and started driving it home and I never would have leased the car if I had noticed it before hand.  Kia said they'd fix it, then stalled till the cooling off period was over, then stuck me with it for the duration of the lease.  

My previous EV (i3) didn't have this problem, so I was taken by surprise but it did make me wary for the model 3.   

So, when a friend got his model 3 and I sat in it and ran the tool and there weren't any high pitched whines except when accelerating under load (which is totally acceptable to me).

Unfortunately, I don't have the opportunity to test drive an AWD unit before I put $60k down on a car, and I really dont want a $60k car to give me tinnitus an hour of my day commuting to/from work.

So....anybody have any quantitative information about this?  A spectrum plot?  Anything?

If its limited to the front motor of AWD, I'll call Tesla and try to change my configuration.   ",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/8v230v/discussion_front_motor_whine_what_is_it_how_bad/,Schnort,153218.0,-0.7452

TeslaMotors,hate,lum2z5,Picked up Model Y yesterday! It's a game changer...,"Let me start with a little background...

I grew up (37 now) around cars of all types. My father owned several dealerships over the years  and I was fortunate enough to spend most of my life riding in and driving all types of.awesome cars. He owned Chevy, Dodge, Mitsubishi, Kia, and Nissan dealerships over the years. 

My first job was detaling cars at the lot when I was 16 and eventually was a finance manager when I was in college. Most of my life was ingulfed in the craziness of a car dealership. I eventually left the business (it wasn't for me) and started a new career once I graduated college. 

Turn the page forward to the purchase of the Model Y for.my wife... The ease of purchase and the non haggling price and rates and everything else under the sun that used used be part of.my job, was simply AMAZING! Even growing up in the biz, I hated the thought of having to go talk to a salesman and negotiate and then go to finance for hours and negotiate more... Tesla has hit a hometown with with me in their purchase and delivery model. 

I was able to talk to my sales advisor anytime i.needed to and was super impressed with the professionals at the Kansas City Stateline rd SC! They were professional, fast and super friendly.
The car was in perfect condition and oh yeah I forgot to talk about the car!!! This car is simy amazing! The comfort, handling and pure awesomeness is astonishing! If you made it this far then you probably already know how great these cars are! Thanks again Tesla!

TLDR: I grew up with a dad who owned lots of car dealerships and this was the best, easiest and fastest purchase I have ever been a part of! Oh and car is the most amazing car I have ever owned!",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/lum2z5/picked_up_model_y_yesterday_its_a_game_changer/,OKCThunderChef,3693.0,0.9928
TeslaMotors,hate,2kqk6r,My open question to Tesla drivers; or Why I Love and Hate Tesla.,"I'm fortunate enough to live in an area where I'll spot a Tesla or two every day on my commute. My college is within 5-10 minutes of the Tesla dealership, so I guess that might be why I see so many. 

I'm just a 19-year-old with a 10-year-old Subaru. I don't even have a Tesla license plate frame. I can't even dream of affording the Model S. A while back, I took the opportunity to go visit the dealership, and my plan was to admire/ scrutinize/ wonder at the Model S until they kicked me out. 

However, it didn't go quite to plan - it went better. I was approached by an employee who casually introduced himself and asked, ""what's up?"" I told him I was curious about the Model S, and I just really wanted to see one up close. I stressed the fact that I absolutely couldn't afford one, but he waved it off like it didn't matter. 

He walked me over to the showroom model and told me to try and figure out **everything** I could do with the center console. That is, how much could I control from that one touch screen. He told me to go sit in it, to open up everything I could find, to fold the seats and move the moonroof around. He answered all my questions, ranging from future plans for Tesla,  specific design elements, and even how he felt Tesla treated their employees. Not once did I feel pressured by anyone there, and I felt like this employee was closer to being a friendly enthusiast, rather than a salesperson. 

In short, it was wonderful. Tesla has definitely bought themselves a (hopefully) future owner in me. But I have one major problem with the Model S, and it drives me INSANE when I see it happening to a Tesla that's on the road with me. That is, the problem is distracted drivers. I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the best driver in the world, but I can at least keep my focus on the road. When I get in the car, my phone stays in my pocket and my hands stay on the wheel (unless I'm changing gears). I've been in quite a few near-collisions with other drivers that were too busy texting to actually look at the road. 

I'm that one guy that waves to every driver of every ""cool"" car. If I can, I'll say something about how I like their car (be it NSX or F-Type or R8 or Tesla). So imagine my disappointment when I pull along side a Model S to say something about their Tesla, and all I see is the driver looking down at the center console screen, messing around in a browser or something. 

I've seen many a Tesla driver actively interacting with the tablet console while driving down a freeway with their cars mere feet away from the vehicle in front of them. My girlfriend and I have even gone so far as to make a game of ""Spot the Testard,"" where we see if drivers are playing around with the touchscreen rather than looking at the road. 

I don't know why I thought Tesla drivers were just magically more intelligent than the average Civic driver. I guess all of my interactions with these drivers in person gave me a false impression that all Tesla drivers are probably really smart. 

It's just really upsetting to see so many of these cars getting driven in ways that cause accidents. So, Tesla drivers of Reddit, do you play around with the media console when you drive? I may just be seeing the worst of the worst here, so I want to know. 

What are your thoughts on using devices while driving? Do you do it? Why?

TeslaMotors,hate,e1azmb,"Thank you Elon. Finally in my life I have experienced complete ""IDGAF"" and it is liberating.","In 2013 we purchased our last ICE car. We've been planning to buy a Tesla since the S came out. We've planned on never buying another ICE car. We have always planned on going electric and wanted to focus on Tesla for a large variety of reasons.

We've planned on buying the truck at some point, but thought that we would be getting a Y first and then getting the truck eventually. We thought the Truck was going to be 49k for a single motor, and we knew that we needed something probably more expensive with better towing capacity.. We will need the truck for towing a few things someday but also we just need a truck for home renovations we plan on doing. 

We're big sci-fi nerds so when we heard it was going to be something very futuristic, my wife and kids were pumped. 

So when the truck was unveiled, we were watching it as a family. It was love at first sight for all of us. Reserved immediately. It's perfect for us in every way. Dual motor. 

My friends all said: ""OMG it's ugly"" ""Not gonna buy this"" ""gonna wait for the electric F150 or Rivian"".  I personally don't think it's ugly. I love the look of it.  I also know that there's a lot of genius that went into the design that people aren't picking up on and also in the improvements/efficiency in manufacturing. 

The truck's price-point and abilities have brought us closer to some dreams that we thought were going to take 15 years to achieve. 

People can make fun of it and I laugh at the memes. I literally don't feel defensive. I'm so happy I ordered one and I have told my friends: ""For once in my life I have no fucks to give. Not a single fuck."" I don't care if you (whomever is reading this) like it, or if my friends like it, or if anyone likes it or hates it.  I guess this is what it feels like to know you made the complete right decision.

I don't give a fuck. Thank You Elon.

TeslaMotors,hate,e2q5gl,"I currently own a Prius, Ford F-350 and a Jeep Wrangler. Cybertruck will replace all of them as it has the pro‚Äôs of each without their con‚Äôs.","Prius Pros: its a fantastic daily driver. Incredible gas mileage. I can transport and lock a ton of gear in the thing (surfboards, mountain bike, golf clubs, backpack), low maintenance costs, reliable. 
Cons: it‚Äôs a Prius. Ubiquitous (my entire family has a gen 3), bland, gutless appliance. Can‚Äôt take it off road or drive it in the snow. 

F-350 Pros: hauls the dirt bike, paddle boards, and tows the Jeep and the boat. It‚Äôs 4WD so it‚Äôll handle off road and the snow decently.
Cons: terrible mileage, my neighbors and the environment hate me because it‚Äôs a diesel, super uncomfortable for long trips, it‚Äôs the size of a house. 

Jeep Wrangler pros: it‚Äôs a ridiculously rad toy, it will go anywhere, no roof or doors, tons of character and lots of fun to drive. 
Cons: no roof or doors, neighbors hate me because it‚Äôs loud, hesitates to go 55 mph, terrible gas mileage, unreliable, uncomfortable. 

I‚Äôve been shopping for a new daily driver /replacement for one of the other vehicles. I wanted either an off road capable suv (4Runner or Grand Cherokee) or truck (1/2 ton or HD crew cab regular bed 4WD). $45k to upwards of $70k on some of the trucks I was looking at. Pretty much everything got 15-20 mpg. I like the idea of the suv because it‚Äôs a larger version of locked storage like the Prius with off road capability, but then no dirt bike or real towing capacity. A regular truck requires a tonneau cover for the locked storage, but try and put anything bulky in the bed and you have to take the things off (which totally sucks). 

I feel like the cybertruck nails all the pros of each of these vehicles without any of the cons (it‚Äôs big but still 3‚Äô shorter than my current truck). This is a pretty remarkable feat. Not only to make an extremely capable adventure-mobile that‚Äôs environmentally friendly, but improve upon best in class ICE offerings in so many ways. 

I put a deposit on a M3 during the unveiling, but punted when it came time to buy. $60k for a fancier and faster version of my paid-off Prius. Didn‚Äôt seen worth it. But CT, my god.

TeslaMotors,hate,en55qf,Left without any transportation because of a blow out on the highway in a loaner. TLDR at bottom.,"I dropped my car off for service on Monday. The repair was scheduled to be completed on Wednesday. By Thursday the repair was still not completed, and I was informed the car would need to be held over the weekend. At this point I asked for a loaner, so that I could have transport over the weekend. My sister in law is visiting from outside the country, and it would be nice to take her site seeing. Everything seemed to be going according to plan until tonight.

While I was taking an interchange ramp from one freeway to another, the front passenger tire had a blow out. I was able to safely recover control and drive slowly down the ramp onto the shoulder of the freeway. Once safely parked on the shoulder I proceeded to call Tesla‚Äôs road side assistance. This is where the real fun begins.

The road side assistance person informed me that, according to their system, they had no record of my loaner. They said they could not provide me a replacement tire; they could not provide us any other form of transportation. All they would do was tow the loaner back to the (closed) service center. Reclaiming the car that they said ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have‚Äù. Being 9:00pm on a Friday, the service center was closed, and will remain closed till Monday. The recommendation they gave me was for us to walk across multiple lanes of traffic (with luggage in tow) and call an Uber from a safe location.

In the end I had to ask a friend to pick up my wife and sister in law, because I had to wait on the tow truck. Afterwards I sat in the car and waited over an hour for the tow truck driver. Then I took an Uber 20 miles home. 

I‚Äôm still in shock from the lack of support and ineptitude of the situation. As presently I am without any form of transportation, and probably will remain this way until the service center opens again on Monday. This is not how I wanted my sister in laws vacation to start. This was and still is a horrible experience that no customer should have to go through. Hopefully posting this will garner some attention as no one at Tesla seemed willing to care what they were putting us through.

Edited: for clarity.

TLDR: Car is in for service; service is taking longer than expected; got a loaner; loaner had blow out; Tesla says I don‚Äôt have a loaner; Tesla towed loaner away effectively leaving us stranded on the shoulder of the highway; can‚Äôt contact service center till Monday.

Update 1: I still have not been able to get ahold of anyone at Tesla who can resolve the issue. The ‚Äúrental‚Äù they gave me was in fact a loaner and not an enterprise car, so there is nothing enterprise can do. The sales center also are not authorized to do any loaners or support me with this issue either. Everyone says I‚Äôll have to wait and talk to service on Monday. I found out from the road side assistance people that I can get my own car rental, and the service center ‚Äúshould‚Äù be able to reimburse up to $50 per day. I‚Äôll have to request the reimbursement with the service center and it will take about 4-6 weeks to be approved.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/en55qf/left_without_any_transportation_because_of_a_blow/,ncklboy,5823.0,0.9789
TeslaMotors,hate,o9w1oz,Yoke Adventures 4 is here,"Probably my last Yoke Adventure video--this one has quick demos of shuffle steering, getting through a traffic circle/roundabout and parallel parking.

[https://osultan.smugmug.com/Cars/Refresh-Model-S/n-jF42tn/i-dZdbJph/A](https://osultan.smugmug.com/Cars/Refresh-Model-S/n-jF42tn/i-dZdbJph/A)

&#x200B;

EDIT:  I am adding a couple of things up here since there are some consistent comments/questions:

* ""The yoke is no better than a wheel"" -- yes and that is the point.  It is functionally comparable to a wheel once you acclimate.  However, the change to the yoke gives you some broader benefits aesthetic and functional benefits in the car, for example,  a more open cockpit, a simplified control scheme, and the ability of the UI designers to make full use of the screen instead of being limited to what is visible in the venter of the wheel and what might be obscured by the driver's hands and arms
* Roundabouts and turn signals -- one thing I am really coming to appreciate is always have turn signals under my thumb.  I don't need to move my hand to reach a turn signal stalk or even loosen my grip to free up a finger to flick the stalk.  My hands remain firmly wrapped around the yoke.  I think that is superior to a stalk--takes some getting used to, no doubt, but I think its better.  Also, if a round wheel ever comes out, its going to have the same buttons--this is not a yoke-related thing
* ""You look awkward"" -- yeah, friends would say that is my natural state :), but also because I am showing you things I don't normally do, like parallel park or shuffle steer.  Even with roundabouts, I had to drive 20 min to get to that one in the video, so muscle memory is still a work in progress--if I lived in that neighborhood, I am sure I'd have that nailed.  For my everyday driving, life with the yoke is easy and drama-free, but I am pretty sure no one really wants to watch a video of me going to In-N-Out:  it would be boring and that is also the point too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/o9w1oz/yoke_adventures_4_is_here/,o2go,4569.0,0.9841

TeslaMotors,hate,dmgtsu,The Pickup is absolutely going to change the game,"I‚Äôve been thinking more about the pickup and I was recently [listening to an interview with Elon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s41qWOb7pVQ&list=WL&index=10&t=0s) when something dawned on me. The pickup is going to absolutely change the automotive industry. Let me explain. When Tesla created the Model S, for all intents and purposes, it was just another car. What I mean is that to the layman, non-carguy type of person, the Model S didn‚Äôt stand out of the crowd. From 100 feet away it was just another car. And even when you knew it was electric, it wasn‚Äôt *that* big of a deal to most people. Why? Because over the last century, there have been numerous examples of ‚Äúelectric cars‚Äù whether they be concepts at auto shows or terrible attempts at actually building one. Electric *cars*. Not trucks. 

So we‚Äôve had the S which looks like any other car, the X which looks like any other CUV (except when the falcon doors open) and the 3 which looks like any other car. Again, I‚Äôm talking about from the perspective of the average person. Even the old and new Roadsters aren‚Äôt a big deal because we‚Äôve all seen ‚Äúexotic cars‚Äù before. Yes I know the new Roadster is going to absolutely blow the doors off of everything on this planet but again, to the average person, it‚Äôs just another ‚ÄúFerrari‚Äù. In fact, most people will probably mistake it for a Ferrari when they see it on the roads. Our brains are already used to seeing that type of vehicle. 

But we‚Äôve never seen an electric Pickup truck before (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong). It‚Äôs such a departure from the conventional thinking. Pickup trucks are big noisy things that run on gasoline or diesel! Everybody knows that! You can‚Äôt make an electric truck! What about the torque! What about towing! What about range! That‚Äôs more or less the reaction I‚Äôve seen from people inside the automotive industry. And to top it all off, Pickup trucks are by far the best selling vehicles in America. Americans fucking *love* pickup trucks. If you‚Äôve ever been to Texas, you know what I‚Äôm talking about. Just the concept of an electric truck is wild enough for most people and Elon is right to style it in a way that stands out of the crowd. Unlike the other Teslas which quietly blend into the crowd, the Pickup will shout ‚ÄúHEY CHECK IT OUT I‚ÄôM ELECTRIC!!‚Äù. It will draw crowds like no other Tesla has. I feel sorry for the early adopters of the Pickup in places like Texas because the owner will be treated like a celebrity every single place they go. It won‚Äôt matter if they‚Äôre picking up their kids from school, going to the grocery store, or eating dinner at a restaurant with their families. People will see that thing pull up and find it impossible to *not* ask questions about it. 

As for the styling of the Pickup, I can‚Äôt believe anybody is worried about it. Listen to the interview with Elon and ask yourself if he would ever allow an ugly vehicle to go into production. The man *obsesses* about design. He even personally worked on the design of the old roadster himself which won him awards. He even admits how nobody in the world notices things like the rear seat rails in the Model X, despite spending countless hours working on it. If he‚Äôs willing to perfect small design details like that, he sure as hell won‚Äôt screw up the overall look of the Pickup. I‚Äôll be the first to say it: not only will the Pickup truck not look bad, it‚Äôs going to look absolutely *badass*. In fact, I‚Äôm sort of dreading it because I know the second I see it, I will no longer lust after the Raptor, which has been a dream car of mine for a long time. Oh well, bring it on!

edit:

Another thing I forgot to mention. The Big 3 make most of their profits off of trucks and big SUVs so for Tesla to finally compete directly with that will scare the living hell out of them. I think that's why Ford and GM are dumping so much money into EV and autonomous because they've seen what Tesla can do and are scared shitless about what they will mean with a truck. Tesla will be cutting directly into their bread and butter so expect even more negative articles from the media as Tesla starts to fight them head to head.",https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/dmgtsu/the_pickup_is_absolutely_going_to_change_the_game/,iltdiTX,529263.0,0.8537
