Two parts to this, one I agree one I strongly disagree.

1) FSD is not full self driving and l2 right now. This is true. Tesla has been promising FSD for 8 years now, it’s not there yet, it’s still beta, it isn’t hands free (due to nhtsa). Until it’s can be regulated behind l3 the price is crazy for what you get today. It’s a promise for the future.

2) He says it’s just L2 which “everyone else has” suggesting some equivalency. This is ludicrous. No other company has anything close (except maybe Xpeng). It’s ludicrous to suggest ford’s blue cruise is as capable as Tesla FSD. Reading his tweets and than watching an FSD12 video and then watching his ford Mach e video..: it’s cringey.

AI can detect patterns in health and financial data because they are typically repeatable and predictable. There is typically a very finite amount of possibilities, and they are applied to a small and specialized problem. For a long time now, the thought of General AI has been thought to be practically impossible. There is too much that can happen. Other drivers, driving conditions, and driving locations can change things instantly. Someone aggressively gets over without a blinker. A lane gets closed out of no where. A guy on a motor cycle splits the lanes. 

The biggest issue in AI is data. If you don’t have enough you can never tune your model. The problem is their solution is to have it try it’s best and be told when it’s wrong, which is known as reinforcement learning.

A better solution would be to allow the collection of driver data from people with high safety scores. Then base your learning off of them.

TeslaMotors,feature,vmmqib,ie1y0tz,t3_vmmqib,"##### All    
- **Disable headlight flash for sentry mode**    
  
  If you live in a busy street / park facing another house / use busy public parking regularly / participate in society it's nice to not draw attention to the car. It just needs to record, no need to flash. There's been plenty of teslacam vids of drunks attacking the car only after it flashes at them, and reports in groups of neighbours complaining of the flashing. Oh and some of us just don't want to draw that much attention to the car.    

  
- **Disable honk on lock when at home/""this location""**  
  
  Honk on lock is a lovely confirmation, but middle of the night with neighbours is annoying for them, and depending on the country, technically against the law (This is true for the UK). Location based lock honks would be a good compromise.   
  
  
- **Accessibility options**   
  We've now had two *lit* holiday updates that resulted in font size, icons, and touch area shrinkages.  Be it due to eyesight, colour blindness, or mobility issues, tesla really needs to include accessibility options to adjust the sizes, and locations, to meet the users needs.  
  (Heck, the first *lit* holiday update with a partial ui redo resulted in so much backlash they restored the font sizes, but took a while longer before fixing text alignments... lol)  
  UI's really can't be half arsed, they need proper diverse user testing  
  
  
- **Better charge scheduling**   
  
  The current setup of exclusionary desired departure time vs start charging at X time is weird. These should be complimentary features, and easily accessible in the same place in the car like in the app.  
  The current off-peak settings, according to the manual, will calculate in reverse from the finish time the time needed to start, but this is not mentioned in the car or app menus, and not obvious as the car will start charging to first calculate how long it needs to charge for.  
This setup assumes we want/need the 80/90/100% that's set as the max charge, when in reality we're often just leaving this as the default and purely care about topping up during the cheaper charging window, so the smart element can work out to be pretty dumb if it decides to charge for longer than is necessary, plus the time spent test charging first at the higher rate.
  
  
- **Display active energy draining settings within energy chart/charging window**   
  
  Though most people become aware that sentry mode drains the battery, it's not obvious to new drivers. Even more so for the ""Summon standby"" setting for those with FSD.  
  For the most part I believe Tesla have solved the phantom drain issues when the appropriate settings are off. But as Tesla doesn't explicitly tell the users what these are, or what the drain is, it'd be nice if this was visualised/listed so that the end user can discover this information themselves    
  
  
- **Customisable minimum SoC% to reach destination**  
  
  Charging at your destination may not always be possible, or within range of the destination. If the journey is long enough the current navigation approach of allowing you to arrive with ~5% means you may get there without enough charge to head off.  
  Having the option to set a minimum SoC to reach the destination at (like in abrp/zap-map/others), would be useful. Something along the lines of `If final leg, SoC_floor = user_input, else soc_floor = 5%` with the user input either being an option during the route planning, and/or a user preference minimum destination %.  
  Off the top of my head an easy way to flesh this out further is to make use of the cars own records of 3rd party/home charging locations too, so allowing for this logic to be conditional based on known charging locations (so you don't need to override when driving home for example, or just offer an ""exclude home"" tickbox like other features).  
  This can be worked around by adding part/all of the return trip onto the outbound so that it coincidentally calculates for a higher SoC at your destination, but this lacks refinement.  
  
  
- **Report mapping error**  
  
  An official way to report mapping errors would be great for fixing map related phantom breaking / dangerous mapping errors / speed limit errors / generally improve the performance of the smart features. Preferably via app and car. For via app have it requiring an account with a linked car would dramatically reduce the risk of abuse.  
  
  
##### 3/Y    
  
- **Expand left scroll wheel conditional usage to include wiper speed (match refreshed S/X feature)**   
  
  Title says it all. Refreshed S/X has this. No reason to not provide it to 3/Y other than gatekeeping the feature. 3/Y already have conditional scrolling depending on what audio sources are active (navigation if it's talking, otherwise music), so expanding that list to include ""*when wiper quick-access is open, scroll through options*"" (*with potential for left/right click to enable/disable auto*)  
  
##### 3/Y (Potentially Europe specific)   
  
- **Option to disable intrusion detection from mobile app to solve alarm going off from bugs**   
  
  Again, title says it all. We're not able to disable the alarm at all in Europe (*required for insurance reasons*), and iirc we can only disable tilt/intrusion detection temporarily till next drive. Due to this, any time of the year where spiders/flies/anything small is common, there's daily posts in local groups about ""*car alarm going off for no obvious reason*"".  
The reason is always ""there's a bug flying around, or a web over the ultrasonics in the roof, or something similar.  
If we're confident that the alarm is bogus, being able to not only stop the alarm remotely (we can by unlocking and re-locking), but then also disabling the in-car sensors via the app would be a nice quality of life change....

- **Disable headlight flash for sentry mode**    
  
  If you live in a busy street / park facing another house / use busy public parking regularly / participate in society it's nice to not draw attention to the car. It just needs to record, no need to flash. There's been plenty of teslacam vids of drunks attacking the car only after it flashes at them, and reports in groups of neighbours complaining of the flashing. Oh and some of us just don't want to draw that much attention to the car.    

  
- **Disable honk on lock when at home/""this location""**  
  
  Honk on lock is a lovely confirmation, but middle of the night with neighbours is annoying for them, and depending on the country, technically against the law (This is true for the UK). Location based lock honks would be a good compromise.   
  
  
- **Accessibility options**   
  We've now had two *lit* holiday updates that resulted in font size, icons, and touch area shrinkages.  Be it due to eyesight, colour blindness, or mobility issues, tesla really needs to include accessibility options to adjust the sizes, and locations, to meet the users needs.  
  (Heck, the first *lit* holiday update with a partial ui redo resulted in so much backlash they restored the font sizes, but took a while longer before fixing text alignments... lol)  
  UI's really can't be half arsed, they need proper diverse user testing  
  
  
- **Better charge scheduling**   
  
  The current setup of exclusionary desired departure time vs start charging at X time is weird. These should be complimentary features, and easily accessible in the same place in the car like in the app.  
  The current off-peak settings, according to the manual, will calculate in reverse from the finish time the time needed to start, but this is not mentioned in the car or app menus, and not obvious as the car will start charging to first calculate how long it needs to charge for.  
This setup assumes we want/need the 80/90/100% that's set as the max charge, when in reality we're often just leaving this as the default and purely care about topping up during the cheaper charging window, so the smart element can work out to be pretty dumb if it decides to charge for longer than is necessary, plus the time spent test charging first at the higher rate.
  
  
- **Display active energy draining settings within energy chart/charging window**   
  
  Though most people become aware that sentry mode drains the battery, it's not obvious to new drivers. Even more so for the ""Summon standby"" setting for those with FSD.  
  For the most part I believe Tesla have solved the phantom drain issues when the appropriate settings are off. But as Tesla doesn't explicitly tell the users what these are, or what the drain is, it'd be nice if this was visualised/listed so that the end user can discover this information themselves    
  
  
- **Customisable minimum SoC% to reach destination**  
  
  Charging at your destination may not always be possible, or within range of the destination. If the journey is long enough the current navigation approach of allowing you to arrive with ~5% means you may get there without enough charge to head off.  
  Having the option to set a minimum SoC to reach the destination at (like in abrp/zap-map/others), would be useful. Something along the lines of `If final leg, SoC_floor = user_input, else soc_floor = 5%` with the user input either being an option during the route planning, and/or a user preference minimum destination %.  
  Off the top of my head an easy way to flesh this out further is to make use of the cars own records of 3rd party/home charging locations too, so allowing for this logic to be conditional based on known charging locations (so you don't need to override when driving home for example, or just offer an ""exclude home"" tickbox like other features).  
  This can be worked around by adding part/all of the return trip onto the outbound so that it coincidentally calculates for a higher SoC at your destination, but this lacks refinement.  
  
  
- **report mapping error**  
  
  An official way to report mapping errors would be great for fixing map related phantom breaking / dangerous mapping errors / speed limit errors / generally improve the performance of the smart features. Preferably via app and car. For via app have it requiring an account with a linked car would dramatically reduce the risk of abuse.  
  
  
##### 3/Y    
  
- **Expand left scroll wheel conditional usage to include wiper speed (match refreshed S/X feature)**   
  
  Title says it all. Refreshed S/X has this. No reason to not provide it to 3/Y other than gatekeeping the feature. 3/Y already have conditional scrolling depending on what audio sources are active (navigation if it's talking, otherwise music), so expanding that list to include ""*when wiper quick-access is open, scroll through options*"" (*with potential for left/right click to enable/disable auto*)",Taoquitok,13233.0,0.996,False,False,False,13233.0,4969,False

TeslaMotors,feature,12yippz,jhngfx8,t3_12yippz,"* I want the old Smart Summon process back in the Tesla app. To expand on this more, currently, the Smart Summon function requires you to be within the 213ft before you can start *anything* Smart Summon related.  **Previously** the app permitted us to set the target of ""Go to Target"" *before* we were in the 213ft bubble.  The newer behavior has basically made it useless to me, because forcing me to wait until I'm in the bubble, lengthens the time it takes for me to connect to the car, set the target, and meet the car there.  Previously I could've had the car woken up, and ""primed"", then when I crossed into range, the I could start summoning the car, and meet it ""half way"", or wherever I sent it to met it.
* Weather overlay on the map
* Talk to the NHTSA about maybe getting a ""max"" of 5mph offset, as that tends to be legal in most places.  In Florida you can go up to 5mph over the limit and only get a warning.  Leaving the offset there, but not the specific number is silly, and honestly makes me more inclined to speed.
* I'd like the ability to pre-plot an FSD route, as I'm finding that some of the routes are ""perfect"", but not tailored towards what conditions will be like.  Best example is that when I go to pick up my kids from school, I have to choose a destination that isn't the school, but a street or two away, so I can make sure I'm at the back of the car rider line.  In other cases, there's just more efficient ways of getting from Point A to Point B that the car isn't aware of, because it's not familiar with the area.  I'd also like to be able to turn off lane changing altogether.  I understand the concept behind ""Route based lane changes only""  [This video](https://youtu.be/FJOfekBSK5U?t=63) shows that the car is changing lanes to ""Follow route"", however, the lane change in question is a bad one, because it needs to be in the right lanes to do the lane change.  I'm running into this in a few spots, and it's new to FSD Beta v11.3.x.  I understand the desire to make sure the car does everything, however, it isn't a Robotaxi yet, and even when that's an option, I still prefer to have more control over the car's functions.  Currently, if I hit the turn signal to cancel the lane change, I have to do it repeatedly, because it keeps trying.  I'd rather just be able to push a button and have it stop for a bit.  **That**, or improve your map data.
* WiFi hotspot in the car for mobile devices, like kid kindles.  I'd be fine with tiered premium connectivity, where a lower tier grants what's currently out there, and a higher tier includes the mobile hotspot feature, including more bandwidth, perhaps.

* All functions on the app should be accessible via website.  [Sometimes I don't want to use my phone to do stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5QRgpjfarY).
* The ability to point out problem areas on Tesla's navigation, without having to trust that the folks at navfeedback@tesla.com are checking their emails
* More frequent navigation updates in the car
* Allow Autopilot engagement state to be exposed via the API, without the use of the Safety Score metrics.
* Build a website which better explains to service menus that the car has, and what their purpose is for, so that folks who want to DIY repair/maintain their car can make sure we're not shooting ourselves in the foot.
* Build better documentation around how FSD Beta works, explaining what the various things in the visualization mean.
* To tie into the above, explain what expectations are regarding testing, so that we can ensure we're providing good data for use.
* If the vehicle's speed is 0mph, let us send a sound through the boombox speaker, or at least don't reset the settings when the vehicle goes into park, requiring us to set it each time the vehicle goes back into park.
* HBO Max streaming - This is where cartoon network and Adult swim shows are at for the kids.  *Some* are on Hulu, but most of it is on HBO Max now.
* More granular control over Autopilot.  Examples would be allowing to set a ""highway max speed"" versus a ""City streets max speed"".  When I'm driving around town I like to be +5 over, when I'm on the highway I like to be +10 over.  This can be hidden behind ""Advanced"" or something.  Have a toggle for ""Be in the correct lane for an upcoming turn Xmi before the turn, and have it range from like .5mi to 2mi or something.
* Automated Supercharger allocation.  As you approach a Supercharger, indicate which stall the driver should pull into to optimize their travel needs, and blend this with queuing people to ensure that they know where they are in the Supercharger line, if there is one, and a rough estimate on when they'll be able to plug in.  (*Shouldn't* need to do this, but it's become clear to me over the last four years of owning a Tesla, that people don't realize that 1A and 2A on a V1/V2 charger share power, so they're going to nerf themselves on how long they spend charging.  This is also in line with Elon's mantra of ""All user input is error"", which while I don't necessarily agree with his mantra, you could use this as the reason to do this.)
* ""Help bounties"", wherein drivers can ""opt in"" to programs where we willingly collect data which can improve FSD Beta/Autopilot performance through our regular day to day driving.

I’d really like to see some sort of iOS/Android integration into the software as well, more than the basic messaging and phone apps. 

I doubt this would ever happen, but it would be really really sweet to connect a Bluetooth capable radar detector to the MCU for native control. The ultimate stealth install.

- **Disable headlight flash for sentry mode**    
  
  If you live in a busy street / park facing another house it's nice to not draw attention to the car. It just needs to record, no need to flash. There's been plenty of teslacam vids of drunks attacking the car only after it flashes at them, and reports in groups of neighbours complaining of the flashing. Oh and some of us just don't want to draw that much attention to the car.    
  
- **Display active energy draining settings within energy chart/charging window**   

  Though most people become aware that sentry mode drains the battery, it's not obvious to new drivers. Even more so for the ""Summon standby"" setting.  
For the most part I believe Tesla have solved the phantom drain issues when the appropriate settings are off. As Tesla doesn't explicitly tell the users what these are, or what the drain is, it'd be nice if this was visualised/listed in appropriate locations so that the end user can discover this information themselves    

- **Disable honk on lock when at home/""this location""**  

  Honk on lock is a lovely confirmation, but middle of the night with neighbours is annoying for them, and depending on the country, technically against the law (This is true for the UK). Location based lock honks would be a good compromise.   
  
- **Accessibility options**   
  We've now had two *lit* holiday updates that resulted in font size, icons, and touch area shrinkages.  Be it due to eyesight, or mobility issues, tesla really needs to include accessibility options to adjust the sizes to meet the users needs.  
(Heck, the first *lit* holiday update with a partial ui redo resulted in so much backlash they restored the font sizes, but took a while longer before fixing text alignments... lol. UI's really can't be half arsed, they need proper diverse user testing)  
  
- **Better charge scheduling**   

  The current setup of exclusionary desired departure time vs start charging at X time is weird. These should be complimentary features, and easily accessible in the same place in the car like in the app.  
  Something like: ***start charge time, plus an optional stop charging times for cheap tariffs(tick to enable?)***, plus tickbox for ""precondition via charger"" for those who don't mind the cost and prefer to pre-heat via their socket rather than drain the range.  
  For the scheduled departure time, It'd be nice to choose how how far in advance of departure it should start preconditioning, for those who just want a warm cabin and not a warm battery.  

  
- **Customisable minimum SoC% to reach destination**  

  Charging at your destination may not always be possible, or within range of the destination. If the journey is long enough the current navigation approach of allowing you to arrive with ~5% means you may get there without enough charge to head off.  
  Having the option to set a minimum SoC to reach the destination at (like in abrp/zap-map/others), would be useful. Something along the lines of `If final leg, SoC_floor = user_input, else soc_floor = 5%` with the user input either being an option during the route planning, and/or a user preference minimum destination %.  
  Off the top of my head an easy way to flesh this out further is to make use of the cars own records of 3rd party/home charging locations too, so allowing for this logic to be conditional based on known charging locations (so you don't need to override when driving home for example, or just offer an ""exclude home"" tickbox like other features).  

- **report mapping error**  

  An official way to report mapping errors would be great for fixing map related phantom breaking / dangerous mapping errors / speed limit errors / generally improve the performance of the smart features.

First, it appears that Musk makes these estimates of delivery dates based on a shallow understanding of the technology, and the realities of software development. It makes more sense that the dates are purely for marketing reasons.

Second, Musk seems to hire high visibility wiz-bang people to head autopilot development. These guys might have some great skills, but I think they are generally not good in a leadership role. What he needs is a seasoned manager who has dealt with delivering complex embedded systems to the real world. This could be someone from wireless comms, industrial control, aviation, etc. It would be a person who understands technology enough to cut through the BS and focuses on results.

Back in late 2015 (?) or 2016 (?) when Elon started saying that his estimates for full self driving kept dropping, and were currently at 3 years, but possibly 2, I started to get nervous.

I'm a software engineer that has worked on challenging problems where getting to 99% is easy, and 99.9% is hard, and 99.99% is really really really hard, and 99.999% seems impossible.  Has Elon worked on those kinds of problems?

The fact that he hired and then let go the guy beyond LLVM was another worrying sign to me.  What I imagined in my head was this guys saying ""Elon, you've been building this tech stack so aggressively, it's starting to get wobbly. You need to do some serious refactoring, etc.""  Elon might have pushed back because he knew how much hot water he was already in wrt his over promises.  If that's true, it's kind of sad, because one of my favorite things about Elon has been that he seems to be a super aggressive long term optimizer.  But I'm speculating heavily there.

Another reason I'm not surprised is because of Model 3.  In big companies where the CEO likes to do a lot of design (read: micro-managing-ish), it's not hard to imagine that progress in one area of the company can be affected if the CEO's attention is absorbed by other critical areas.  Given that the whole company pretty much is hinging on the success of Model 3, and given how super super aggressive he was (and still is being) about the timelines for the Model 3, I suspect that pressure has drained a lot of Elon's cycles this past year and a half.  And as he says, they're still in ""hell"" trying to climb out of that.

And of course, he's not just getting absorbed by Model 3 stuff, he's running SpaceX, he's now running what used to be SolarCity, and if that wasn't enough, there's new Boring stuff, neural link stuff, etc, etc, etc.

  Honk on lock is a lovely confirmation, but middle of the night with neighbours is annoying for them, and depending on the country, technically against the law (This is true for the UK). Location based lock honks would be a good compromise.   

- **Disable headlight flash for sentry mode**    
  If you live in a busy street / park facing another house it's nice to not draw attention to the car. It just needs to record, no need to flash. There's been plenty of teslacam vids of drunks attacking the car only after it flashes at them, and reports in groups of neighbours complaining of the flashing. Oh and some of us just don't want to draw that much attention to the car.    

- **Draggable navigation waypoints**   
  We've been teased the basics of working waypoint functionality. Now lets hope they flesh it out    
  
- **Better charge scheduling**   
The current setup of exclusionary desired departure time vs start charging at X time is weird. These should be complimentary features, and easily accessible in the same place (too many people complain about getting stuck on 1 mode or the other. Additionally the inclusion of amps in the app has resulted in numerous FB posts about charging at reduced speed 'cos someone didn't realise they had pressed the slider).   
  Something like: **start charge time, plus an optional stop charging times for cheap tariffs(tick to enable?)**, plus tickbox for ""continue to charge outside this"" for those who don't mind and prefer to pre-heat via their wall charger than the car battery even if outside their cheap tariff.   
  Plus a scheduled departure time tickbox, when enabled it shows a time box, a drop down for how much in advance to start pre-heating (5-10 min increments?), and a toggle for allow weekends.   
I feel like that should cover the features needed for a fully functional scheduled charge/drive timer while remaining simple enough to use.

For example, say you pull into a 5 stall V2 (150 kW) supercharger station and there are Teslas parked at 1A and 2A, the car would tell you to park at 3A because its the last stall available without having to share power (would have to share power at stalls 1B and 2B). Using the same example, if stalls 1A (charging at 50 kW), 2A (charging at 120 kW), and 3A (charging at 75 kW) where occupied, the car would tell you to park at stall 1B since the adjacent car at 1A was pulling the least amount of power. Therefore, you could charge at 100 kW without affecting the car in 1A. Finally, if all stalls are full, the car would tell you your place in line, and estimated time of wait.

Patent expiration is challenging because most companies have related patents that are fundamental to the technology that are spread over multiple years. Which effectively extends expiration many more years beyond initial fundamental patent expiration.

Given the rate that they have added new software features I tend to give them a pass on features like these that seem like something they would obviously want to implement, but they haven't. When it seems likely there are patents involved.

I have my driver's side mirror as wide as it can go, which required both 1) reducing the overlap between it and the center mirror to a narrower range than on any prior car and 2) angling it slightly downward, because for some reason that allows it to angle a bit wider. Even with these measures taken the blind spot on the model 3 is definitely present, particularly when merging onto a highway. 

The indicator/warning on the screen is frankly terrible compared to side mirror lights. First, I have to look in a third place (and away from the road) after checking both mirrors. Second, the corner of the screen it's in is the mostly likely to be blocked by my hand. Third, unless your signal is on, a car in your blindspot is an easy to miss grey shape on a grey background.

**Enhanced Autopilot**

> Enhanced Autopilot adds new capabilities to the Tesla Autopilot driving experience. The enhancements include going from one to four cameras for greater accuracy, redundancy, and to see fast-approaching vehicles in adjacent lanes. In addition, 12 ultrasonic sonar sensors provide 360 degree coverage around your car with almost twice the range and resolution of the prior version. The significantly increased sensor information is processed by a computer that is over 40 times more powerful than before. Your Tesla will match speed to traffic conditions, Keep within a lane, automatically change lanes without requiring driver input, transition from one freeway to another, exit the freeway when your destination is near, sen-park when near a parking spot and be summoned to and from your garage. That said, Enhanced Autopilot should still be considered a driver's assistance feature with the driver responsible for remaining in control of the car at all times. Tesla's Enhanced Autopilot software is expected to complete validation and be rolled out to your car via an over-the-air update in December 2016, subject to regulatory approval.

$5,000 *($6,000 upgrade after delivery)*


**Full Self-Driving Capability**

> This doubles the number of active cameras from four to eight, enabling full self-driving in almost all circumstances, at what we believe will be a probability of safety at least twice as good as the average human driver. The system is designed to be able to conduct short and long distance trips with no action required by the person in the driver's seat. For Superchargers that have automatic charge connection enabled, you will not even need to plug in your vehicle. All you will need to do is get in and tell your car where to go. If you don't say anything, the car will look at your calendar and take you there as the assumed destination or just home if nothing is on the calendar. Your Tesla will figure out the optimal route, navigate urban streets (even without lane markings), manage complex intersections with traffic lights, stop signs and roundabouts, and handle densely packed freeways with cars moving at high speed. When you arrive at your destination, simply step out at the entrance and your car will enter park seek mode, automatically search for a spot and park itself. A tap on your phone summons it back to you. Please note that Self-Driving functionality is dependent upon extensive software validation and regulatory approval, which may vary widely by jurisdiction. It is not possible to Know exactly when each element of the functionality described above will be available, as this is highly dependent on local regulatory approval. Please note also that using a self-driving Tesla for car sharing and ride hailing for friends and family is fine, but doing so for revenue purposes will only be permissible on the Tesla Network, details of which will be released next year.

I know the end game is that ""All user input is error"", but everyone has different tolerances to how they want to drive safely.  I'd love to be able to more tune FSD to how I prefer driving, versus how the software currently does.
* In that vein, an ""Advanced user"" or ""Power user"" section, or something, which allows us to have more fine grain control over various functions of the car.  While I don't need to to record from the pillar camera, I would like to be able to go to a menu and get a view of the pillar camera, just to make sure it is working, that sort of thing.
* In *that* vein, better support for DIY repairs, so that we can better view diagnostic information, and determine severity of issues and potential repair options.  I know the service manual information is out there, but having seen what the technicians have, I'd prefer access to that level of detail, if it is some ""kit"" that I have to install in my own house to relay the information to.
* Ability for Tesla API to state whether Autopilot is on or off.  I do a lot of logging via TeslaMate, and I'd love to have a more accurate recording of how many miles were driving with AP on/off, and when disengagements occurred, if any.
* Ability to tune charging stops when on longer road trips.  I think currently it goes for ""Go further, charge longer"", however, I think some folks prefer to stop more and charge less.  Again, I understand ""All user input is error"", but there's times where it isn't in error.  *Personally*, I have a medical condition where I need to use the bathroom every 30-60 minutes, so stopping more and charging less, is preferred for me.
* Ability to do a ""one time"" FSD package transfer to a new vehicle after someone has owned a vehicle for X years, maybe when the warranty runs out, then you can gain the ability to do an FSD package transfer, at a time of your choosing, but after the warranty has expired.  I think we're reaching a price point where I feel this is fair for a software enablement package.
* Partnerships with companies that offer ""Free gas miles"", or whatever, that provide ""Free supercharger miles"" when using their services.  Like Kroger has their 2-3x gas miles thing, or credit cards do their ""Get 4% back on gas purchases"", these kind of perks need to be pushed more.  (This isn't Tesla specific mind you, but as Tesla owns the chargers, they have to be willing to partner)
* In that vein, in addition to occasionally offering free charging during heavy holidays, maybe offer some kind of benefit to folks to charge after hours, like gifting them one free supercharger mile for every 10 charged, outside of ""peak demand"" hours.  Like some kind of rewards program, hell, make it work with non-Tesla owners to to encourage folks to travel after hours and such.",Nakatomi2010,260413.0,0.9982,False,False,False,260413.0,3664,False

**Dumb CC**: Cruise Control without any traffic awareness, for those who have to deal with phantom braking way more often than they have to and don't want to wait indefinitely for a fix.

  


  


**Better, clearer, more direct, more communicative and transparent incident reporting system:** Having Autopilot slam on the brakes is a danger to not just the driver but to other people around them. Having the car react to incorrect speed limits is dangerous. Having the car behave erratically because it thinks a truck one lane over is going to ram into it is dangerous. Having the camera interpret random shit in the distance as an Amber Traffic light is dangerous. For a car focussed on safety and accident prevention, its systems sure do some dangerous shit. Give us a well defined way to log these incidents, report them to Tesla, and to log the reports we send in. It's frustrating not knowing whether our problems are even being perceived, let alone addressed by Tesla. 

  


  


  


**More Smartphone integration or Android Auto / CarPlay**: Some folks prefer using a navigation system other than what Tesla has built in (such as Google maps, Waze, etc). Some of use apps other than WhatsApp or the default SMS app for communication (like Signal, Telegram, etc). Either implement functionality for these features into the Tesla infotainment system or give us access to Android Auto / Car Play like most other cars offer.

- **Disable honk on lock when at home/""this location""**  
  Honk on lock is a lovely confirmation, but middle of the night with neighbours is annoying for them, and depending on the country, technically against the law (This is true for the UK). Location based lock honks would be a good compromise.   

- **Disable headlight flash for sentry mode**    
  If you live in a busy street / park facing another house it's nice to not draw attention to the car. It just needs to record, no need to flash. There's been plenty of teslacam vids of drunks attacking the car only after it flashes at them, and reports in groups of neighbours complaining of the flashing. Oh and some of us just don't want to draw that much attention to the car.    

- **Display active energy draining settings within energy chart/charging window**   
  Though most people become aware that sentry mode drains the battery, it's not obvious to new drivers. Even more so for the ""Summon standby"" setting.  
For the most part I believe Tesla have solved the phantom drain issues, if the appropriate settings are off. As Tesla doesn't explicitly tell the users what these are, or what the drain is, it'd be nice if this was visualised/listed in appropriate locations so that the end user can discover this information themselves    
  
- **Better charge scheduling**   
The current setup of exclusionary desired departure time vs start charging at X time is weird. These should be complimentary features, and easily accessible in the same place (too many people complain about getting stuck on 1 mode or the other. Additionally the inclusion of amps in the app has resulted in numerous FB posts about charging at reduced speed 'cos someone didn't realise they had pressed the slider).   
  Something like: ***start charge time, plus an optional stop charging times for cheap tariffs(tick to enable?)***, plus tickbox for ""continue to charge outside this"" for those who don't mind and prefer to pre-heat via their wall charger than the car battery even if outside their cheap tariff.   
  Plus a scheduled departure time tickbox, when enabled it shows a time box, a drop down for how much in advance to start pre-heating (5-10 min increments?), and a toggle for allow weekends.   
I feel like that should cover the features needed for a fully functional scheduled charge/drive timer while remaining simple enough to use.

TeslaMotors,feature,urlx3u,i8yc8kg,t3_urlx3u,"Here's my running list of ""things that would be nice"" from over the years:  
  
Involve the cloud more between app and car. The only things I need the car to be awake to tell me is the newest battery level and the current cabin temp. The battery level shouldn't be too different from the last known state, and the current cabin temp is mostly just interesting trivia. It doesn't have a ton of bearing on any decision I'm about to make. Almost everything else can be instantly updated on my phone from last knowns sent up when the car was awake. I drove 2 hours to get home, plugged my car in at 20%, and it was awake for the whole time and able to tell the mothership everything about it. Why on earth does my app show my car as 2 hours away and 40%, because that's the state of things when I happened to open the app last yesterday until it can ping the car and wait for the wakeup? Likewise things should work the same in the opposite direction. Pull phone out, set climate to 73, put phone away. No waiting. Tesla handles waiting for the wakeup behind the scenes, and just alerts us if there's an issue. With these 2 changes the app would for all intents and purposes feel instantaneous. (Some controls work this way now, and rumor has it overall this is happening.)  
  
Add a 3rd state, or just stop using ""locked"" as a status, when pulling on the handle would open a door. It's really confusing having to explain to people that yes, my wife has to go back and get the phone she forgot in the car, because even though I can lock the car from the moon, and see that it's locked, the car would let anyone who tried in, since her phone is there. Then shrug like an idiot when they ask ""so in what sense is it locked then?"" There should be SOME indication on the app that the car either can't be locked right now, or that it's locked but not ""secure"". Or something. By no reasonable definition is a door that would open for any person that tried to open it ""locked"". Maybe this is as easy as making it so manual locks can only be manually unlocked with the app or a card. I assume this would also really help people who have to park outside, but live close enough where their phone occasionally strays close enough to un-secure the car.  
  
Separate drive modes depending on the gear. Hold mode is perfect for drive, but I'd love to be able to put it in creep mode for reverse.  
  
Weather map layer would be nice.  
  
Sentry mode is disabled during camping mode, but it would be cool if the camera part still worked and just the ""blasting music and honking"" part was disabled. Arguably you never want the footage more than if you and a loved one are the cargo.  
  
There's a hard fought battle between team percent and team ""miles"" but there's really only one place that matters because space is limited (though, ironically in miles mode the miles and the symbol are there, so it's the one place that kind of shows both.) Everywhere else could and should just show both. There's plenty of screen room, preference could just determine which is the bigger font or listed first.  
  
Minor, but people who have been towed discovered this: The car should update its location on every wakeup, not just when driving. A car that gets towed should show where it is. Maybe there's some weird security thing with tow yards that dictates this happens so psychos don't show up with a gun to get their car back, but if not, it's my car, show me where it is. If nothing else thieves could take advantage of this. Flatbed it somewhere and the fanciest tracker there is means squat.  
  
Tapping the battery when moving should open the graph, not the charging screen.  
  
Add ""stats"" to the teslacam vids. (Speed, AP status, location, time) (or log them so they can be added and removed at will during playback)  
  
Add a heat button to the HVAC screen like how there's an AC button. On a road trip once we were worried about our battery life and found ourselves micromanaging the temp so that the heat wouldn't come on as the temp outside changed from warmer than we had it to cooler than we have it. At the very least have an indicator of ""this is heated air, this is outside air, this is cooled air"".  
  
Make double pressing wiper button cycle the speed up a level, or down a level, which ever seems to make the most sense, then wrap back around to off, like a ceiling fan.  
  
Make auto-wipers keep sentry cam actually recording meaningful videos, at least when officially triggered by something, instead of filming an underwater scene because there's water over the camera.  
  
The maps sometimes show pop ups of cross streets or something. These should be turned off when navigation is going. It can be confusing when right at the point you have a decision to make the car isn't helping with because technically you're staying on the same sub-highway (even though it's told you to ""keep left to stay on"" at 5 toll booths and a wayside so far) when it's highlighting ""275 North"" in the pop up bubble even though it's really wanting you to take 275 South. There's no reason to draw driver's attention to something that has nothing to do with the route you know they're on, ESPECIALLY right at the point they should be making a move.  
  
When you plug in to charge (regardless of whether or not it actually starts or is scheduled) send a notification to phone (and possibly on screen) if the car was previously put into a ""trip mode"" charge. This would helps prevent going to 100% when you don't need it because you put it there for a single charge earlier. (Alternatively there could be some kind of ""Next charge only, or remain here?"" when you move the line, but a notification seems easier.)  
  
We shouldn't need abetterrouteplanner to get around for long trips. I've gone on one ""I just need to hit one SC to get home"" trip in my ownership, and thankfully we decided on the sit down place over the quick place, because if I didn't go WAY over what the car told me (I was the only one charging and still moved partway through my meal) I would have been stranded in Bumfuck, FL in the middle of the night in 40 degrees, which is basically floridian for 20 below. The car knows the temp, knows your temp habits, knows the PSI of the tires, etc etc etc. Why is Some Guy able to make a more accurate guide than the official in car guide?

Notes on #1, Blended braking is not the evil many like to make it out to be. The idea is that regardless how you decelerate, pressing the brake or lifting off the pedal, that the regenerative means are used first but in all cases if regenerative capacity is limited from cold or full pack that the car blends in the real brakes so that you slow at the same rate regardless. This feature is on many other EVs. The car is already effectively doing this when it drives itself.

Stopping at reds and signs seems like a good first step. Leveraging autopilot also makes sense since it signifies the driver must take over on failure just like they have to on a steep curve now.

Starting again requires a lot more cameras and recognition. Plus the driver may want to turn so that also requires more problem solving. I suppose it makes sense why it wouldn't start on its own.

TeslaMotors,feature,gptb71,frp2uvs,t3_gptb71,"Cost is the only justification you need. 

For one thing, there are a lot of cheap enhancements you can make to a car. If you think about it real hard, you could probably come up with a thousand $1 enhancements to a car. If you actually made them, that car now costs $1,000 more. 

Aside from that, small savings are still worthwhile. Tesla sold about 360,000 cars last year. A $1 saving is $360,000. If a full time engineer with a Silicon Valley salary spent an entire year coming up with that idea, they’d still save money, and quickly. 

There’s a famous story about how the head of American Airlines, back in the 1980s, figured out that they’d save $40,000/year if they removed one olive from the salads served to first-class passengers. That seems insignificant for a large company, but it also took them very little time and effort to implement, so it started paying off right away. If you keep doing this sort of thing all over the company, it can really add up. Think of it like buying coffee on your way to work. A $5 latte is insignificant compared to your annual salary, but if you buy one every morning, you can save a bundle if you stop.

TeslaMotors,feature,w8j6si,ihpp90s,t3_w8j6si,"##### All    
- **Disable headlight flash for sentry mode**    
  
  If you live in a busy street / use busy public parking regularly / participate in society it's nice to not draw attention to the car, especially late at night. It just needs to record, no need to flash. There's been plenty of teslacam vids of drunks attacking the car only after it flashes at them, and reports in groups of neighbours complaining of the flashing. Oh and some of us just don't want to draw that much attention to the car.    

  
- **Disable honk on lock when at home/""this location""**  
  
  Honk on lock is a lovely confirmation, but middle of the night with neighbours is annoying for them, and depending on the country, technically against the law (This is true for the UK). Location based lock honks would be a good compromise.   
  
  
- **Accessibility options**   
  We've now had a variety of updates that have reduced the font size, icons, and touch areas, often with reversals of these changes in the following months.  
Be it due to eyesight, colour blindness, or mobility issues, tesla really needs to include accessibility options to adjust the sizes, and locations of the interactive elements, to meet the users needs as there's no physical fall-backs for most options.  (*slightly tongue in cheek, but a good start would be to make the car visualization optional to expand available space* :D)   

  UI's really can't be half-arsed, they need proper diverse user testing  
  
  
- **Better charge scheduling**   
  
  The current setup of exclusionary desired departure time vs start charging at xx:xx time is weird. These should be complimentary features, and easily accessible in the same place in the car like in the app.  
  The current off-peak settings, according to the manual, will calculate in reverse from the finish time the time needed to start, but this is not mentioned in the car or app menus, and not obvious as the car will start charging to first calculate how long it needs to charge for.  
This setup also assumes we want/need the 80/90/100% that's set as the max charge, when in reality we're often just leaving this as the default and purely care about topping up during the cheaper charging window, so the smart element can work out to be pretty dumb if it decides to charge for longer than is necessary.  
  
  
- **Display active energy draining settings within energy chart/charging window**   
  
  Though most people become aware that sentry mode drains the battery, it's not obvious to new drivers. Even more so for the ""Summon standby"" setting for those with FSD.  
  For the most part I believe Tesla have solved the phantom drain issues when the appropriate settings are off. But as Tesla doesn't explicitly tell the users what these are, or what the drain is, it'd be nice if this was visualised/listed so that the end user can discover this information themselves    
  
  
- **Customisable minimum SoC% to reach destination**  
  
  Charging at your destination may not always be possible, or within range of the destination. If the journey is long enough the current navigation approach of allowing you to arrive with ~5% means you may get there without enough charge to head off.  
  Having the option to set a minimum SoC to reach the destination at (like in abrp/zap-map/others), would be useful. Something along the lines of `If final leg, SoC_floor = user_input, else soc_floor = 5%` with the user input either being an option during the route planning, and/or a user preference minimum destination %.  
  Off the top of my head an easy way to flesh this out further is to make use of the cars own records of 3rd party/home charging locations too, so allowing for this logic to be conditional based on known charging locations (so you don't need to override when driving home for example, or just offer an ""exclude home"" tickbox like other features).  
  This can be worked around by adding part/all of the return trip onto the outbound so that it coincidentally calculates for a higher SoC at your destination, but this lacks refinement.  
  
  
- **Report mapping error**  
  
  An official way to report mapping errors would be great for fixing map related phantom breaking / dangerous mapping errors / speed limit errors / generally improve the performance of the smart features. Preferably via app and car. For via app have it requiring an account with a linked car would dramatically reduce the risk of abuse.  
  
  
##### 3/Y    
  
- **Expand left scroll wheel conditional usage to include wiper speed (match refreshed S/X feature)**   
  
  Title says it all. Refreshed S/X has this. No reason to not provide it to 3/Y other than gatekeeping the feature. 3/Y already have conditional scrolling depending on what audio sources are active (navigation if it's talking, otherwise music), so expanding that list to include ""*when wiper quick-access is open, scroll through options*"" (*with potential for left/right click to enable/disable auto*)  
  
##### 3/Y (Potentially Europe specific)   
  
- **Option to disable intrusion detection from mobile app to solve alarm going off from bugs**   
  
  Again, title says it all. We're not able to disable the alarm at all in Europe (*required for insurance reasons*), and iirc we can only disable tilt/intrusion detection temporarily till next drive. Due to this, any time of the year where spiders/flies/anything small is common, there's daily posts in local groups about ""*car alarm going off for no obvious reason*"".  
The reason is always ""there's a bug flying around"", or ""a web over the ultrasonics in the roof"", or something similar.  
If we're confident that the alarm is bogus, being able to not only stop the alarm remotely (we can by unlocking and re-locking), but then also disabling the in-car sensors via the app would be a nice quality of life change....

You can erase it by disabling autopilot and cruising into 1-3s lead time, since the metric is the ratio of this. If you enable autopilot or cruise at 3s+, you'll keep your bad score!

TeslaMotors,improve,qakbek,hh3wwfj,t3_qakbek,"The Navigate on Autopilot that's in the FSD Beta 10.2 is the same as the one that's in the pure vision cars.  It's not really the beginning of single stack as much as slightly different logic using the same mechanisms.

I've observed an issue with lane changing where if you're on a three lane highway and you're in the far right lane, and someone is in the far left lane, and the center lane is empty, the car repeatedly has issues telling whether the vehicle in the far left lane is in fact in the left lane.

I initiated a lane change to the center lane and the car aborted back to the right lane because the car in the left most lane ""drifted"" into the center lane.  The car in the far left never ""drifted"", the car simply misjudged it and aborted it.

When on FSD Beta you're basically using the ""bare minimum"" autopilot that the Pure Vision folks got when they took the radar out.

I will say that when the lane changes do work its much more smooth than when the radar was in play.  The only real comparison I can give is that radar based lane changing felt more programmatic, in that you would start to signal, the car would validate that it could change lanes, change lanes, then go back to ""Normal autopilot"".  Now you turn the signal on and it just goes over.  It doesn't feel like a program's subroutine just kicked in to perform a task.

But there's no ""single stack"" in play here yet, it's just that you're seeing tasks performed without the radar now.

It will start playing and the playback will actually be gapless. The functionality is already there, however the implementation doesn’t use it.

So however your suggestion is great, I don’t think Spotify can do anything. It will have to be Tesla. I’m just worried that they’re too busy developing games and ignoring real quality of life changes like this one.",iRemz,7241.0,0.9052,False,False,False,7241.0,710,False

The car can't handle more than 1 thing at a time specially if you are using navigate and autopilot. MCU1 cars just stop working.

What I actually want is spotify Podcasts and the software to continue where I was left of if I go back to a podcast in either TuneIn or if in Spotify the feature would be added. I hate the fact I am listening to a podcast like Joe Rogan for instance which sometimes is 3 hours long and the next time I drive I put on some radio or spotify and when I want to finish the Joe Rogan podcast or any other I need to search 10 min to find where I was left off.

TeslaMotors,improve,8gv2xw,dyfn2ov,t3_8gv2xw,"I added this comment in reply to a Samsung Galaxy user, but thought I'd add it as a top level for visibility:

Samsung Galaxy phones (S8/S9/Note/etc) have both the native Android battery optimization feature described by OP, as well as a Samsung added 'sleep' feature that will put infrequently used apps to sleep which disallows them running at all in the background.

I don't have a Model 3 yet, but for apps that I need to ensure run in the background, I always opt the app out of both of these things - add it to unmonitored apps (Settings -> Device Maintenance -> Battery > SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM -> Unmonitored apps) and disable battery optimizations like OP, which is found under Settings->Device Maintenance->Battery->Battery Usage->3-Dot-Menu->Optimize Battery Usage.

My understanding is Optimize Battery Usage is an OS feature that limits the times an app can be awake in the background (ie the app may want to run all the time or frequently while the OS may say nope - you get once an hour, or something like that) to reduce battery use, while the apps not explicitly listed as ""unmonitored apps"" feature is a Samsung add-on that puts apps completely to sleep (they will never run in the background until explicitly re-opened by the user) if they have not been opened after a few days (3 by default).

I would think for the Tesla app you'll want both places to list it on Galaxy phones (assuming the app is involved in the car unlock process, which appears to be the case given OP's observation).",Kidd_Funkadelic,34457.0,0.9769,False,False,False,34457.0,1506,False

TeslaMotors,improve,wis9y5,ijdmq0w,t3_wis9y5,"Oo Aerospace student! AE grad here, though i've forgotten quite a bit of concepts since graduating, but heres my take- So, if you have taken Statics & Strengths of Material already, its mainly due to Mass Moment of Inertia (and sprung vs unsprung weight).

The 19"" Sports Wheel + Tire is heavier due to larger diameter of the wheel itself and larger wheel/tire width than the 18"" Aero Wheels + Tire. Note- The total diameter of the wheel w/ tire mounted should be almost identical between the two wheel setups, which means the sidewall height of the tire will be smaller on the 19"" (And this also means that more weight of the heavier tire of the 19"" would be further out from the axis of rotation).

So, more power will have to be exerted by the motors on the LR due to the higher sprung weight (heavier battery pack + extra motor) and unsprung weight (heavier wheels) to achieve the same per unit distance vs the SR.

There is some aero differences between the Aero wheels (w/ the cover on) vs the Sports wheel- Mainly less turbulent airflow due to the aero cover, but I do not think it would affect range that much solely from the extra drag alone (Though it'd be interesting to see CFD / Wind Tunnel tests comparing both).

Moreover, the tire compound also plays into a factor for your total range due to the rolling resistance (and tire pressure plays into account too). The stickier the tire, the higher the rolling resistance, the lower your total range.

Well, almost. It would first chime and show lane change intent on screen, then 2-3 seconds later it would put on the turn signal, then 2-3 more seconds before changing lanes. You had just enough time to tap to cancel before the turn signal came on.

Then in one software update a regression (imo) was introduced where it puts on the turn signal immediately, waited the full 4-6 seconds, then changed lanes.

Then they ""fixed"" it... my guess is someone who didn't understand the original feature was tasked to fix it: they shortened the duration of the turn signal before merging, rather than bring back the pre-signal time that allows a user to cancel before looking like an idiot.

Or it could have been intentional to reduce the total time between vehicle decision and changing lanes, while still maximizing turn signal duration.



I turned confirmation back on a long time ago, NoA is just really bad at judging when best to change lanes. People who say it works perfect are likely not very attentive drivers.

TeslaMotors,improve,alt8v2,efgvhhd,t3_alt8v2,"I must say I am confused by what was said on the earnings call as I fully expect a larger pack size for s/x to be introduced by August at the latest. All the signs are there with the removal of the 75d and its subsequent replacement in a software limited 100kWh that we think is around 92kWh. The extra 25 miles range for the “extended range” option at a ridiculous $8000 price point is baffling. 

I note they called it “extended range” rather than “long range” so I would be dismayed if they do not introduce a “Long Range” pack, hopefully in March but surely by August?

Something must surely be afoot with the rollout of supercharger V3 in “early 2019” (which I would call ‘early’ by the end of March) and the Model Y reveal expected in March.   Coupled with a reduction in options for the model s/x, followed by the 100kWh pack scenario described above, I’d be amazed if we don’t see a larger pack introduced and it makes no sense to me that it would be based on the old cells. 

I’m baffled as I thought the 2170 cell introduction made perfect sense. 

I don’t buy into the “if they tell us what’s coming they’d lose sales” way of thinking. All other auto manufacturers reveal new models ahead of time and it hasn’t harmed them. I for one am waiting to purchase a model X because it seems like major change is around the corner. If they outright came out and said there will definitely be a refresh in Q2 2020 then I would just purchase this years model as I’m not prepared to wait that long. I’d upgrade to the 2020 model in 2 years anyway. However, I’m currently in a perpetual state of waiting instead as there seems to be something going on so I’m waiting in anticipation of what that might be. Therefore they currently have no sale. I find the uncertainty frustrating. No one wants to drop $100,000+ on a car that might be updated next week. 

I travel a lot of miles each day (at least 100, often 300+) and live in the UK with low winter temperatures, so a larger pack is important to me. I appreciate I’m in the minority and the 100kWh pack will do fine for most people. However, Tesla is missing a sale right now because they can’t properly communicate with their potential customers. 

Edit: just as an aside as this is said a lot and not thought about...

Yes, I know that 200 miles is plenty as you’d need a break after that. But what if your journey is 110 miles, you stay somewhere for two days without charging nearby and don’t want the hassle of supercharging in the 110 mile journey home?

Some would say ‘then an EV is not for you’, perhaps not, but I don’t think that scenario is unreasonable. It is a chore to not be able to drive somewhere and back again hours or days later when you can easily do that in an ICE car. I am prepared to change my driving habits as I just want a model x because they are impressive and a good size for my growing family, but others in the UK and other countries will continue to have “range anxiety” until an EV can do as many miles as an ICE car in whatever weather conditions.

I think some people assume that having a larger cell gives greater packing density but it doesn't necessarily. With larger cells you can fit fewer in a given pack size. They don't tesselate any better since they're fundamentally the same shape. However there are likely a few gains like relatively smaller can thickness and roll edge width for the larger cells. Cooling probably makes up a smaller portions of the pack for larger cells.

Cell manufacture should be cheaper (per kWh) for larger cells since there are many per-cell operations (like canning, fusing etc), so fewer, larger cells is better.

I hear you on a few of these.

How do you think software and battery will be improving the energy efficiency?

1. Are batteries going to produce less heat at the time of discharge? 

2. Software is trickier, IMO, because I expect that the Model 3 will have more cameras on it to potentially support the enabling of nearly fully autonomous driving at some point in the future.

TeslaMotors,improve,4koote,d3gsrnd,t3_4koote,"Two questions u/MaxYoung

1) Could you explain this bit again not sure If I misunderstood.

> We also know from the model 3 prototypes that Tesla has done a lot of work on wheel drag as well. They previously claimed 3% increased range from the cyclone wheels, so we could expect at least 2-3% going to slipstream wheels and then something even better. So that totals 4-7% improvement.

I was under the impression that drag coefficients on vehicles are tested with the wheels on so I think you might be counting the same improvement twice; meaning the 3 with the new wheels gets a 0.21. Also, were did you get your frontal area numbers for the 3?

2) I wonder if you have any opinions on the HVAC system since heating and cooling the cabin has a noticeable effect on energy consumption? The 3 should have a little smaller passenger cabin resulting in less thermal inertia and less surface area for heat exchange with the environment. That the trunk storage area is walled off from the passenger cabin will add to this benefit. [VP of engineering also brought up a new HVAC design. I get the feeling this is more important than just the aesthetics of removing vents.](https://youtu.be/Qr2FaDh-Hlg?t=179) In terms of a greenhouse effect from the large amount of glass I think between their UV, infrared, and tint coatings it won't be of concern. Particularly if one gets a light grey, tan, or white interior. Wondering if you or anyone else has been mulling over improvmeents Tesla could make to the cliamte system overall.

I expect ~ cd=.21, = 12.5%

If the frontal area is 4% less => 1.125x1.04 = 17% less aero drag.

A significant hit on EPA mileage will be the 65mph drag, which is 50% of total drag in your graph. IDK what % of the total is hy driving, 40%? .4*.17=6.8%

Add to that the gains at ~33mph, and you should be over 7% total.

>Major caveat is the ""sub 6-second 0 to 60 time."" Is a 50kWh battery big enough to pump out that power? Will newer battery chemistry help? No idea, but I'm prepared to be amazed.

I estimate that ""ludicrous mode"" would require 68kwh, assuming a 20% lower mass. 6s would require half that power, or 34kwh.

\- do not cut the led strip while it's powered on. you'll short it. good thing is that it comes back on. for me it was 3 hrs and someone on model 3 owners club said it took 3 days.

\- the LED strip has 2 connectors, one on each end. one end you connect to a 12V adapter and another is just 2 bare wires. this is the end you want to use.

My impression is that the Plaid S rear bench would be adequate for someone around 5' 10"" in height with average proportions, though perhaps less comfortable from a leg angle perspective as the Model Y rear bench.  The squishiness of the cushions will also play some role.

TeslaMotors,improve,hl80c1,fwzxrhp,t3_hl80c1,"I think there are a number of issues with service today. I have to think that Tesla is very aware of these issues and has either struggled to resolve them or has not allocated resources to do so.  It's clear that they have a poor reputation, although I have had only good experiences. 

Issues seem to be around:
- delivery defects
- service center repairs
- parts availability, e.g. collision or glass

Delivery defects are really lame, and I suspect that in the heat of the end-of-quarter rush they are pushing cars out too fast, or not inspecting them well, or just have shitty QC. I doubt the problem is as widespread as it seems based on this community or others; these are where people go when there are issues, but Tesla just had a terrible rating from JD Power so there's something wrong for sure. This one might be helped by a social media campaign on here, Twitter, other fora, Facebook.

Service Center issues seem to have gotten less frequent. The one I have seen several variants are either a) service location not offering warranty service or charging diagnostic fee for warranty service, or b) problem not resolved after a visit.

Parts availability was highlighted by crash repair documented by The Fast Lane guys. Took forever to get parts, and repairs were very expensive. I had a similar issue just trying to get a replacement windshield -- took over a month. My guess was that they just didn't have the logistics of parts delivery nailed down, and maybe still don't.

Quality out of the factory door has to be a priority. It's incredibly inefficient to fix cars after they have been delivered. It's incredibly disappointing to spend big money on a car and have it be significantly imperfect. And Tesla has been getting dinged on this over and over. 

I don't think a data boycott is likely to be effective. Seems like it's the wrong punishment for the crime. Online shaming might work. I wish someone from Tesla, other than Elon, could take ownership and be a public face of Tesla.",tomharrisonjr,6194.0,-0.9888,False,False,False,6194.0,2001,False

Euro price for car is likely yet to be determined depending on whatever future currency fluctuation will be and adding any government EV incentive price offset if that's necessary (see below).  $35k USD leaves that ambiguity in place.  It's simply not set in stone I'm guessing.

> No infos on government subsidies:

Ger. subsidies are in state of flux/negotiation between gov. & industry: (see: http://www.wsj.com/articles/german-subsidies-of-electric-vehicles-seem-a-step-nearer-1458743518)

If industry is required to pay for part of subsidy (as floated by gov. proposal), manufacturer's might optionally raise price of cars accordingly to compensate (unless indirectly subsidizing from elsewhere and eating the cost.)

I think another problem is they need to be precise on the subsidies language or risk headache afterwards; it's easier to omit it all than inadvertently imply a promise of some subsidy amount or other until there's stability from Gov. proposals and clarity of regional subsidy amount and notes of sunset periods (also proposed by govt.)

> No driven mileage/cost-saving tool

The savings are skewed by high Ger. electric prices (vs US) and high diesel subsidies (lowered fuel pricing vs US).  See chart of hypothetical Tesla Model 3 vs. BMW 3 diesel & petrol price savings: (https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/4eae2z/tesla_model_s_deliveries_are_up_35_in_germany/d1z6ka3)

I'm randomly guessing it's easier for them to just have a ballpark and assume 20mpg v8 S-Class petrol comparison for example.  It's up to the end user to determine and calculate if they're going with something other than Tesla default (e.g., a 15mpg V12 S-Class equiv., some >25mpg diesel, or some econobox).  Maybe they'll add an estimator later and currently consider fine tuning + adding an estimator a deprioritized issue at this moment.  I'm sure they have a lot of things going on concurrently; the result isn't polished yet, but I'm guessing they're targeting people that prefer to get something functional early rather than waiting an extended period for something more fine tuned and processed.(?)

Acceleration is largely smoothed out, relative to FSD v12.3.4. I had a single decision-based disengagement: on a right turn, FSD turned into a wide shoulder instead of the actual right-most lane. With v12.3.4, there was a spot in my neighborhood that FSD would _always_ abruptly slow down, this has been fixed (thankfully). It also activates the turn signal while exiting a roundabout on my route, which is awesome. After taking off my sunglasses, I didn't need to touch the wheel at all while in FSD ☺️

There was one instance where v12.5.1.5 did accelerate a little too aggressively from a stoplight, but it was still smoother than v12.3.4. The only other disengagement I had was because I wanted to take a different route into a parking lot.

Overall, v12.5.1.5 is a really nice improvement over v12.3.4. Granted, I've only had one round trip, but it definitely seems like a solid jump. Not needing to touch the wheel kind of brought some of that ""magic"" feeling back that I had the first time I tried Autopilot, the first iterations of FSD for in-town driving, and when they introduced ML trained decision making earlier this year. Very exciting times ☺️

Hopefully there's less of a delay between major versions for us moving forward.



UPDATE Aug 26:
Now that it's been a few days, I've used it quite a bit more. There are some more regressions in this build that I've noticed. I also got to use it briefly on the highway.

More than once, it'll wait for a right turn. A car will pass, so FSD will start to go...but another car is coming. I've had to hit the brake in this scenario 2-3 times in the last few days.

Stop light behavior is a bit strange. It stops fine, but when the light changes to green I've had it get uncomfortably close to the lead car and start to go then hesitate then go.

Highway driving seems a bit smoother, but taking an exit, it seemed to sway left just a bit before taking the exit right. Kind of strange, but not a big deal.

I peaked at TeslaFi's firmware page this morning and it definitely seems like they may only have had a very small group to begin with or maybe they slowed or stopped the rollout over the weekend. I can only speculate as to why.

TeslaMotors,improve,wgi5ko,ijd79ls,t3_wgi5ko,"Explanation of my downvote:

While I sympathize with bad service experiences, we have had our share as well, the statement that because of that you would not buy another Tesla, even though you have been blessed with a model s for the last two years, just seems off. Also the reference to 'articles you read' - which are known to be full of misrepresentations and lies about Tesla all the time for a variety of reasons, or referring to Elon Musks private tweets, or the completely overplayed 'fit and finish issues' that anti Tesla fudsters keep spinning, doesnt lend your writeup credibility.

Just like the 'equivalent cars at similar price levels', I can only disagree with after test driving the MachE, ID4, Bolt...

&#x200B;

In terms of hit and miss with our service appointments, we had mobile service person showing up without the parts while my wife was walking through the rain to meet them at the car. On another occasion when the 12V battery was dead and the car wouldn't start up because of it, on a weekend, the roadside assistance recommended to leave the car behind (not a safe neighborhood) and they would take care of it after the weekend. So instead we got a jump for the 12V battery from a AAA person and drove home.

But on the flip side, the mobile phone app is super easy to make appointments and provide descriptions and images, and for the 12V battery replacement, I did not even have to stop my work meeting, they just texted me when they started the work in my drive way and when it was done.

I used to hate taking time off from work or my private life to bring money to the pump for gas, to go to oil change, and smog check, failed lights and whatnot type appointments. With teslas, there are less appointments to be begin with and without wasting my time.

We have been driving electric only since 2016 when we replaced our Honda Odyssey with a Tesla Model X90D, and we can drive twice as far with it with the same amount of effort, because of autopilot and the smooth gliding ride. It is such an immense step up in life quality that the service issues seem annoying but petty in comparison.  


While I wish Tesla would get service consistency under control earlier rather than later, the approach of radically reinventing how things are done and refining them to improve over time, is why we have these radically better vehicles in the first place.  I much prefer the phone app than the interactions with the stealerships of previous cars we had.",skrylll,4976.0,0.568,False,False,False,4976.0,2477,False
TeslaMotors,improve,wgi5ko,ij2w0z0,t3_wgi5ko,"My biggest gripes aside from what your post mentions:

- Buyers don't know 100% what they are getting.  Which tires?  Mudflaps and PPF?  AMD or Intel?  No way to find out until you pick it up.

- Can't have accessories installed prior to delivery.  It's bad enough the HomeLink module is $350, but then I have to wait for a service appointment to install it.  It could easily have been installed prior to delivery.  Even the guys who came to install it agreed with me on this one.

- Waiting months for a VIN, and then being given an extremely narrow window to pick up the vehicle.  Especially since it doesn't involve interacting with a person, why is there even a set time?  I know demand is high, but if I've paid for it in full, I shouldn't have to jump through my own asshole to pick up a car on their schedule.

- No choice of wheel colors.  Maybe I don't like matte black rims on my blue Model Y (spoiler: I don't, and intend to have them refinished).  At this price point, there should be some option to select different wheel finishes.  

Most of this is basic care sales stuff.  For many people, this is one of the most expensive things they'll ever buy.  This little shit should be fixed, and none of it is particularly difficult.

Now, importantly, even this move does NOT mean they are long-term abandoning radar!

While the road can't change a car could cut you off. As long as you know this didn't happen you can keep driving off the lane data you stored from vision.

I get what you're saying, but this is exactly the issue they've been having with radar in the first place. Say the car's driving beneath a road sign, or past a piece of metallic litter when visibility gets occluded (spray, direct sun, etc) and the car slams on the brakes since it's relying primarily on radar input for the ~.8s the forward cams don't have visibility. 

No visibility is no visibility, and having a sensor that essentially can only command ""STOP"" for uncertain conditions ahead has resulted in a long history of phantom braking on these cars, which is incredibly dangerous on its own given the right set of circumstances.

If you rewatch the battery day Q&A, [specifically here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6T9xIeZTds&t=10972), they seem to dance around the idea when talking about Vehicle to Grid. 

“We basically can enable that (V2G) in Europe (CCS2 cars) with a software update or something” but “it just happens with the way North American connectors are..... the Tesla connector and the connector other cars use (guessing CCS1) can’t do this (V2G)” and “future generations of (Tesla) power electronics (CCS2 port?) will have the ability to do this”. Breaking that all down it seems they might move to CCS2 with future vehicles and Tesla’s version of bidirectional charging will be DC only as only bidirectional AC charging at home would work well.

Maybe they’re waiting on the Model S/X refresh to announce it more clearly so as not to Osborne themselves.

I hope if they did ultimately do this EA could replace their spare unused connectors with CCS2 cords. That would be basically an overnight solution. Then I would wonder which other manufacturers would follow Tesla’s lead.",brobot_,76541.0,0.9497,False,False,False,76541.0,1198,False

In NA you would need transfer switches and other electrical wiring/ components to really be able to leverage this.

What the HELL is supposed to be the competitive advantage of ICE manufacturers in non-ICE cars ? Build quality and manufacturing know-how are all well and good but not what defined their advantage. Most of their R&D went into designing... ICEs. That's where the added value is, where the difficulty is, where there is an advantage to be gained.

Can you imagine a car manufacturer surviving all those years while buying their ICE to a third party ? It's just unthinkable. The same will be true of manufacturers in the future.

The only other thing that will be worth something in the car will be software -- another thing ICE manufacturers sucks at.

Now i am not saying that all current manufacturers are doomed -- of course not. Buying your batteries from a third party is all well and good for transitioning over a few years.

But ultimately, the manufacturers will have to build their own batteries if they are to survive, they will have to design their own software and get good at it, and they currently are very far behind on both those points.

TeslaMotors,missing,apcrxn,eg7i99p,t3_apcrxn,"I've downgraded from a Model X to Model 3. The M3 provides a tighter driving experience. The MX affords much for conveniences.


In the MX you can open all doors and rear trunk manually from your key fob. You can also close them all at once from the fob. You can also do that from your phone. In the M3, you can unlock the car and unlatch the trunks from your phone. Also, the key fob is a lot more reliable for the MX for detecting proximity than my Galaxy S7 is to my M3.


With the MX, you can activate summon really quick from the fob. The M3 requires a bit of time via mobile app to connect before being given the option to activate summon.


The MX has an option for the 75 amp onboard charging unit. 40 amp is default. The M3 is stuck with at 35 amp. This doesn't affect Supercharging rates, so meh.


The MX has a split dashboard for the speedometer, turn signals, drive mode, etc. The M3 puts all this info in a split screen in the center LCD, and doesn't have the real-time energy graph.


The MX control stalk includes a dedicated control for autopilot as well as controls for windshield wipers. The M3 requires you to use the gear shifter to activate autopilot, and the scroll wheel to adjust speed and following distance which isn't too bad. However, the auto wiper sucks so bad you'll want to control it manually. To do so you'll have to go through the touch screen UI to adjust your speed which is a two-step process, where the is more traditional with the stalk.

“On Monday, Tesla announced that it is acquiring Maxwell Technologies for roughly $218 million in an all-stock deal. Maxwell Technologies is interesting for its dry battery electrodes and its ultracapacitors. As shown in the figure below, its dry battery cathodes have an energy density of >300 Wh/kg today with a pipeline leading to > 500 Wh/kg, each 25-50% and ~200% higher than the batteries in EVs today. Maxwell also claims that its battery solutions are more durable, lower cost, and potentially cobalt-free.

While Maxwell Technologies’ solutions could increase the range and lower the cost of electric vehicles, other applications could be just as interesting. In a 2014 talk at MIT, Musk noted that 400 Wh/kg would enable compelling electric aviation. One of the biggest pushbacks against electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft (eVTOLs) is noise. Electric aircraft make a lot of noise because their rotors have to displace a lot of air and must be highly efficient to enable adequate range. Theoretically, as the energy density of batteries improves, eVTOL rotors will be able to sacrifice some efficiency in order to lower noise levels.

Maxwell Technologies also has expertise in ultracapacitors. While lithium-ion batteries have high energy density but low power density, ultracapacitors are the perfect complement with low energy density and high power density. In other words, an ultracapacitor can charge and discharge rapidly but can’t store a lot of energy. Ultracapacitors are useful for utility energy storage and regenerative braking today, but they also should be able to boost vehicle performance in the future. Maxwell’s highest power ultracapacitor, for example, could add the equivalent of 100 horsepower for a two second duration in an EV for just $450. Consequently, Tesla’s next generation Roadster could become one of the fastest cars ever produced, or its pickup truck capable of towing heavy loads could debut with the ability to accelerate at a record-breaking rate.”",[deleted],-1.0,0.9827,False,True,False,-1.0,2254,False

If you pair two chargers, you can avoid ""wasting"" a 120kW charger on a car that only takes say 20kW by putting the remainder into the paired charger.

The costly part in chargers imho is the dc-dc converter, that outputs the required voltage and amperage. If you put a capacitor before that, you still need the same dc-dc converter, so you gain little to nothing. Especially since typical capacitors have a rather low specific energy and energy density.

Keep the battery out of the deceleration / acceleration parts of driving.

The benefits could be impressive because the bulk of the car's power is spent overcoming Newton's first law. If you can transfer the acceleration draw from the battery to the caps the battery may see no discharge. (imagine what that means while observing the energy meter when accelerating) I don't know specifics on these caps, or even other caps in development. But in theory, this could be a perfect solution to increase range. Since motors perform best at constant speeds (no acceleration) a battery's charge could be minimized to just cruising and possibly extending the range by a lot if a majority of acceleration is handled by the caps.

There are also a lot of other benefits to the dry electrode technology Maxwell has patented.

Personally, though, I've never been in a situation where I really wanted or needed to use anything but a Tesla supercharger or destination charger.

My Model 3 has that because I got it before autopilot became standard, it works exactly as you would expect it to, and its kind of crazy that there isn't a way to switch to it on the newer cars.

Would also be great to see improvements to wipers. Right now there are times where the auto wipers don't react fast enough and the wiper control still feels dangerous. It has always seemed like there would be an easy way to fix it with the existing controls.

Similarly, I've never been impressed by the auto high beams, and the pop up every time I manually turn them off is kind of annoying.

We paid $60,000 for the car and to remove or disable physical parts that we pay for is not cool. There are some things that were on my 2016 Ford edge that are not on my 2021 model Y, which is insane since the model Y is triple the cost of what I paid for the edge

The big things are, we need the Blindspot light on the side of your mirrors, it’s way more accurate and way more dependable, but most importantly, it’s faster to use that than to look at the screen look at the mirror look out the window look at the screen, etc. before changing lanes, and the Blindspot camera isn’t even that great. Mine are washed out at night so it’s basically unusable if it’s not daytime, The blind spot light is so easy I just don’t get why it’s not there.

The next big thing is rear cross traffic alert we have these nice cameras, but why is there a no cross traffic alert? My Ford Edge would beep and let me know if there was a car coming behind me when I was backing up, the blind spot light on the mirror would also turn on from whatever direction the car behind me is coming from. 

 Why is there no ventilated seats for the model 3 and Y? Again my 2016 Ford edge had that I don’t get why my $60,000 Tesla doesn’t have it.

Where is the 360 view camera and a front camera we can use? Not to beat a dead horse but again my 2016 Ford edge had a front camera that had a button extremely accessible. Using it for parking, I could see everything in front of me, why Tesla doesn’t have it? I’ll never know.

You seem to have won the lottery on issues with your car, issues with the company, and honestly, maybe a little bit of pickyness, or unrealistic expectations.

I would probably buy something else if I had your same experience, but it's important to note that your experience is not the one that everyone has, as has been proven by plenty of customer satisfaction surveys and the like.

The maintenance and breakdown issues are totally inexcusable, and definitely one of the main areas Tesla needs to improve.

However, you seem to have purchased a model 3, the 'budget' part of their lineup, and expected everything you get out of the same price of car elsewhere. With an EV, at least right now, you are paying much more for the drivetrain than in a comparably priced ICE car, so if 'luxury' is your only desire, then yes, you can definitely get more luxury for your dollar elsewhere.

As for the features

Heated steering wheels are standard now

Power trunk is standard now.

I sincerely have no idea what you're on about with the two comments on lighting. My model 3 has these, and they work fine? Same for passive entry. There's a good chance it's a phone power saving setting that's the cause, but the fob is the built-for-purpose device you were looking for. Shame they don't include one, or at least have it as an order option. 

I'd imagine I have the luxury of driving in california, but many of the automatic options that don't work for you do for me. SOunds like Tesla needs to do more training on data from outside CA.

There's a fair bit more model S, the more 'luxury' part of the lineup has, but I'm not an owner, so I couldn't tell you about them.

&#x200B;

All in all, you seem to be a mix of reasonably angry with reliability issues, and overly picky with many other things, but it's your prerogative to be picky, it's your $ after all.

Your post just seems to have a tone of trying to convince everyone that they're wrong for being totally fine, or very happy with their car. Perhaps you should have included your list of likes along with the dislikes, instead of burying them in a comment.

Tesla killers need to fulfill at minimum the following criteria (in no particular order):

*  Reasonable range and power. 
*  Autonomy - capable of full level 5 as Tesla has promised
* Good looking. I don't know why this is so difficult for other car manufacturers. A lot of the EVs on the market are horrible. The Prius, the i3, Leaf, the list goes on, why are they so hideous? The Bolt looks average at best but it looks like a cross between a hatchback and a minivan, neither of which are an exciting base to work from. The only other car that I don't think is hideous is the Nissan Zoe, which just looks like an average hatch. 
* It is a good car, regardless of the power unit. If the Model 3 were an ICE vehicle with the same feature set (let's say a decent turbo 4 engine with sub 6 sec 0-60, full level 5 autonomy in the future, futuristic but usable interior) I'd still consider buying it.

Real Tesla killers are **car killers**. The Model S didn't do well as an EV because it was an EV first, it did well because it was a **good** car first. You didn't have to compromise on the car aspect to get to the EV part. Most people could substitute their luxury sedan with a Tesla MS and it wouldn't dramatically affect their lives. At least in terms of utility. Of course the likes of BMW and Merc are ahead when it comes to fit and finish, etc but as a daily driver? Not really.

Those who say such and such is a Tesla killer really don't have any clue. Because I guarantee you that if you ask a bunch of genuine model 3 reservationists, they would say that there is no competition. If they're going to get an EV, it's Tesla or nothing.

In 2016 Tesla used ~80k * 80KWh = 6.4GWh of batteries, or about 15-20% of the total world production.

To make 1M cars/year at 50KWh/car you need a supply of 50GWh/year. 

So in 2020 Tesla will probably have access to almost 50% of the world battery supply. Meaning it will have the equivalent share of the EV market.

In other words: batteries are the current bottleneck to EV manufacturing.

Later, we will need to consider charging infrastructure, etc, which also needs to be scaled-up. But between today and 2020, it's all about who has the most batteries.

There's always something new right around the corner.

But I've since come to terms with it for a few reasons:

Faster 0-60 times are nice.

Your battery will deteriorate over time no matter what, so your battery will last longer. 

It will increase your resale value.

You won't usually charge all the way, so essentially your range is 180. And you won't want to go below 40 miles left on your charge. So on a S60, you are essentially working with 140 miles. It makes the increase in range seem like more percentage-wise.

 Also less time at superchargers on a road trip.

Nobody ever complained about having too much range.

I also got other perks, like the matte wood decor for free (price went up $750 later) and faster delivery time.

Elon was really talking about pricing of American roofs, the Austrlain market is different and in particular our building code and the product used here are different.

The Slate/Tile look of the Tesla solar roof is more applicable to America or Europe.

For QLD I would recommend colorbond or even regular congregated iron. Even as regular iron roof and PV panels would easily last 25-30 years, so if budget was a consideration, I would get a cheaper roofing material and more PV.

Tesla make very good PV panels in the Buffalo factory, the are standard Panasonic panels of very high quality, but even these are not easily installed on Australian roofs due to differences in building codes. You could see if Panasonic has a similar product which targets the Australian market. 

Similarly there are probably other makers of solar tile products that target the Australian market and match our building standards.

Tesla are not really targeting selling Solar in Australia at present, they are targeting selling Powerwall and it is likely to do very well in our market.

What I recommend is getting several quotes on Solar+Batteries, then post a query here about the price and the quality of the components:-  https://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum/143

The guys on this forum are absolute experts on Solar in Australia including many industry reps, it is very important to ask them about the quality of the components as price ins't everything...

TeslaMotors,missing,7gm36t,dqnjtf3,t3_7gm36t,"The roof pricing is a bit of a fib. You look into it and they're comparing to some very fancy slate, not the sort of roof you put on a normal house.

Also, and perhaps this is just a personal view, but the justification that an integrated roof/solar panel has far superior aesthetics seems ill founded. Solar panels just aren't that ugly. People put all sorts of shit on their roofs. You know what's ugly? TV antennas. PV is relatively benign looking, and there's practical aspects (angling it to the sun) for not integrating it into your actual roof.

The argument that people want an integrated roof and solar panel seems a bit like the idea  that people want an integrated wall and TV. It sort of might sound sleek and efficient and nice. But if you've got a bit of experience with TVs you can tell it locks you in to an particular system and will come with a ton of drawbacks and ultimately be a clusterfuck.

In Q3, we recorded $52M in ZEV credit sales compared to zero in Q2.   

&#x200B;

In Q3, energy storage deployments grew to 239 MWh, an increase of 18% sequentially and 118% compared to Q3 2017

&#x200B;

We deployed 93 MW of solar energy generation systems in Q3, an 11% increase sequentially. Cash and loan sales made up 80% of residential deployments in the quarter, up from 46% in Q3 2017. Due to the complexity of Solar Roof, we continue to iterate on the design of the product via intensive reliability testing, and we also continue to refine the installation process. Accordingly, we expect to ramp production more quickly during the first half of 2019.

&#x200B;

In Q3, we opened 44 new Supercharger locations for a total of 1,352 Supercharger stations. To date, we have over 11,000 Supercharging connectors and over 20,000 Destination Charging connectors globally.

&#x200B;

Model S and X Performance mix declined roughly 4-fold since 2015, yet Model S and X gross margin (excluding ZEV credits) continued to improve by roughly 600 basis points over the same period of time. Margin growth was caused by gradual cost improvements driven by lowering labor hours per vehicle, reduced cost of raw materials, and various other cost efficiencies. We continue to target a 25% gross margin ex-ZEV credits on Model 3.

&#x200B;

We stopped taking Model 3 reservations in North America in early July 2018 when we moved to a direct order system. Of the 455,000 net reservations that we reported in August 2017, less than 20% have cancelled. We are expecting most of the remaining reservations to gradually convert to orders as we launch more versions of Model 3, introduce other financing options, and begin sales outside North America.

&#x200B;

In order to significantly increase the affordability of Model 3, we have decided to accelerate our manufacturing timeline in China. We are aiming to bring portions of Model 3 production to China during 2019 and to progressively increase the level of localization through local sourcing and manufacturing. Production in China will be designated only for local customers.

Tesla is always improving these cars and if you are always waiting for the next thing, you'll always be waiting. If you like the car as it is equipped today then it's good to buy now.
     
Future additions Tesla might add to the Model S this year: 
* Auto opening doors like the Model X
* Upgraded interior (Unlikely, but possible)
* HUD if the Model 3 is getting one.
* Upgraded center console hardware to make it faster and more responsive. Supposedly the Linux OS that the current console runs on will be updated soon to speed up the existing units but it wouldn't surprise me if they also upgraded the hardware. It's pretty outdated at the moment. 

Things that might be removed soon:
* No more 60kWh model
* Paint colors and options. These are always changing so if they have what you want now, then it's good to go for it. 

The difficulty in this decision is that nothing is set in stone with what Tesla might change. I can easily live without any of the changes I mentioned. The Model S is a phenomenal car today so I went ahead and ordered.

Here’s how this works: in Canada, the federal incentive is available for cars priced blow CAD 45k, or just below what the SR+ costs. However, there is a loophole: if there is a base trim of the same car that sells for less than CAD 45k, then the incentive is available for other trims that sell at up to CAD 55k. So, in order for SR+ to qualify for the incentive, Tesla made a software locked compliance trim that is sold for CAD 44.5k. They intentionally made the range very low, just 150km, so that they don’t end up selling many of these (I remember reading that a Toronto showroom sold one since it was launched). The Canadian government allows them to get around the restrictions in this manner, but it requires that the compliance trim cannot be unlocked post-purchase.

TeslaMotors,missing,85ajxa,dvwdopc,t3_85ajxa,"Pretty good write-up, I shared many of the same sentiments when I rented one off Turo.  The lack of a heated steering wheel, especially in a premium electric car just baffles me.  Even the lowly ugly little cheap ass Bolt has a heated steering wheel.  It makes so much sense to be as efficient as possible in an EV, and not having to turn on the heater because of having heated seats and heated steering wheel can have a huge impact on range.  Agree that the steering wheel completely feels like an afterthought.  Especially when you consider that they could have solved so many issues with having those steering wheel buttons give you total control of the touchscreen.  

After driving a cheap Bolt lease for a few months, I'm also surprised at how useful the surround view backup camera setup is on the large touchscreen in the Bolt.  I love having a bird's eye view of the car when parking.  The Model 3's backup camera is really unexpectedly bad.  

Only thing I disagreed with was your assessment of the Model 3's stereo.  I felt it was lightyears ahead of what the Model S had in it, and while it was very bright sounding, it also had adequate punch to the bass that made it feel very balanced.

TeslaMotors,missing,ehufss,fclqa5a,t3_ehufss,"If a FSD license stayed with an individual and not the car I think it would create a few advantages for both consumers and Tesla. 

1) It incentives individuals who are on the fence to purchase FSD to pull the trigger on it now rather than later. For instance...I want the features that are currently available for FSD but I am leasing my Model 3 (mainly because I figured there would be a lot of EV improvements in 2022 that would be worth exploring). I really have no reason to get FSD on a lease...but if it is tied to me personally then I do have a reason. 

2) It will keep customers loyal to the brand. Let's say this individual FSD license is $10K...you're going to stick with Tesla cars for as long as possible to make that $10K worthwhile. This will also give Tesla a big competitive advantage long term...especially if they create a kind of ecosystem for their cars like Apple did with the iPhone. If other manufacturers catch up and start producing better EV's it won't matter, people that own Tesla's already have their FSD license, maybe they paid for lifetime ludicrous access and lifetime supercharging as well. These folks are going to own Teslas for a long time. 

3) If they do have it track by individual, a subscription model is also a lot more viable which will ease the point of entry for a lot of people.

TeslaMotors,I want,oetbed,h48vhy0,t3_oetbed,"Agree.  There should be some sort of reward. 

Since this post is stickied, I'll post my full reasoning why it's justified.

Tesla has been selling FSD for nearly 5 years at this point.  People spent 2-10k+ extra over other options in order to buy this package that still doesn't exist.  5 years means that there are many people who purchased FSD who have already moved on or are ready to move on.  I have had my car for 3 years as of 4 days ago and I'm ready to start looking but losing premium connectivity + downgrading to Autopilot would be a huge loss and I'm not willing to shovel out another 10k just to have what I already paid for but never got.

The goalposts have also moved for FSD.  Originally, it was worded to seem that buying FSD meant that the car would be able to drive you from coast to coast, with the promise of a demo soon.  That never happened, and now the goalpost seems to be that the car is capable of doing these things, but there is no guarantee of reliability (just like how Smart Summon could technically drive to you in a parking lot, but we know how that works).

Then there have been the constant shifting of timelines on top of that.  I don't blame them for this, but just expect that something is done to make up for it.  We were constantly hearing about how the next massive update was a few months away but in reality progress has been very slow and unreliable so far.

Providing free FSD transfer also doesn't actually cost them anything.  Sure, it's a lost opportunity cost, but otherwise in the end it's just software (unless another HW update is required).  It's even cheaper than providing free supercharging or premium connectivity, because those both require resources to use.

Most likely there will be another HW update required to improve the performance.  That means that FSD with HW3.0 probably won't even be that great and could require a lot of intervention.  That's also something we weren't sold on in the beginning.  It already diminishes the value of FSD if the hardware isn't going to be upgraded (I assume not).

The people who purchased FSD early on were the people who went around proselytizing about Tesla to everyone, supporting the stock, supporting them on forums, and so on.  I have done so much advertising for Tesla yet I feel like a fool for having recommended that others get FSD a few years ago.  It feels pretty disgusting as a fan.  Elon constantly upsold FSD saying how great it is and how the demos are working well.

On top of that, other competitors are rapidly catching up and have similar features, despite being traditional car companies and not tech companies.  Enough so that it wouldn't be a problem for me to switch over if this is all I'm going to get.

In the end, I think they should offer a one time transfer to a new Tesla vehicle at minimum.  If they plan on going sub only, then I'd say 3-5 years of free subscription with a new vehicle.  Lifetime seems pretty extreme but given that it doesn't cost anything and would keep people locked into it, it wouldn't be a bad option either.",PlaneCandy,105778.0,0.998,False,False,False,105778.0,3071,False

Stupid things I love:   

* I love the ""hold"" feature of the brakes. It took me a good 3-4 weeks before I discovered this feature.
* I love the over-the-air updates. I noticed the behavior of the turn signals had changed at some point (holding the turn stalk before the ""click"" would give you 3 flashes, now it will flash as long as you hold the stalk, which I prefer because when I switch lanes, 3 flashes are too few), which was all done over the air.
* Cell phone as your key (although this was spotty for the first 3 weeks of ownership, ever since an update in December happened, it's been almost flawless).
* The simplicity of the interior

Not a single one of those things have anything to do with the car being electric. As a UX Designer, distilling the ""need"" down to the components and rethinking old ""patterns"" is never a bad thing.

However, once the technology exists to have a computer to chaperone your driving so you don't accidentally injure or kill others, it may be appropriate for the government to require it. You'll still be able to drive, but you will not be able to crash into anybody else - the computer will override you if it thinks that's going to happen. 

And of course at that point, insurance premiums for un-chaperoned driving will skyrocket, since on average the people insisting on un-chaperoned driving are not the safest of drivers. Maybe they will even refuse coverage for un-supervised driving.

Eventually, driving without computer copilot will be considered reckless endangerment - since you have a tool make sure you don't hurt anybody and you chose not to use it.

But all of this is many years away. Say 20 years until computer chaperone is a required standard, then another 20 years until vehicles without that feature are a minority.

Auto high beams are so completely broken it’s hard to believe I spent $65,000 and they just straight up *do not work*. Thankfully a Reddit post told me you can enable autopilot and then immediately flick the left stalk forward to disable auto high beams. Autopilot will not disengage and your auto high beams will be disabled.

The only phantom braking I've found is when it detects the exit of an intersection as an entrance and thinks the light/stop sign applies to you.

Overall though, my car takes corners and can almost take unprotected intersections on its own. It is far too cautious when it needs to go and far too bold when there are obvious vehicles heading straight into its path. I'm looking forward to the day you don't need to monitor it so closely.

Having been almost yeeted into the wrong lane on an un-protected left in broad daylight with a no warning disengagement, it’s safe to say almost everyone claiming “real FSD is here!” has no experience like this.

Instead of slowing down more though I accidentally accelerated rapidly. 

I cleared the pole but was left wondering for a second or two, what had happened. I then realized what it was.

I'm going through Tesla Energy hell too! I've never had a worse experience with a company/entity.

First off:

888.518.3752 - Tesla's main service line

888.731.7652 - Tesla Energy Customer Relations

I'm writing up my experience for a blog post, but here's some highlights.

Sounds like your delay was mostly from financing. Mine has been installation issues. There have been several serious mistakes. Including making the same exact mistake twice, even though I knew they were doing it and tried several times to warn them. We failed my city inspection twice *for the same reason both times.*

Similar issues where they literally don't work on this project. Nothing ever happens until I call and prompt them to work on it.

They've missed or cancelled nearly every appointment (the ones I had to fight tooth and nail just to get).

Their communication with me is terrible, and their internal communication is worse. I can only talk to ""project advisers"" and they can't directly talk to the maintenance folks!!! They have to *send an email* and then say they'll call me back (they often don't).

So many of the people I've talked to, and obviously the installation crews too, are sorry to say quite incompetent.

Both of which (frictioned communication, incompetent employees held-on) is supposed to be anathema to Elon's leadership style. So either he doesn't really do that in his companies, or he has no idea the shitshow that is his own Energy division.

Now don’t hate on me (im actually a huge Tesla fan), but the delivery experience was a big miss for me. A while after ordering, someone from the delivery center emailed us to cancel our custom configuration to get a car that was in stock already. I thought that was weird, but hey, at least I’m getting it earlier. Switching VINs because of this was a nightmare and caused confusion. Then, the delivery was delayed a few times (not bc COVID, delivery was last year) for some unknown reasons. We drove 2 hours to pick it up and waited another hour. However, they just showed us to the car, and didn’t teach us how to drive, or at least basic functions like the touchscreen or key card. Nope, you had to figure it out yourself (mind you, it was January and freezing and we didn’t know how to turn on the heat). Also, the car was charged 25% full, and there was only a wall charger (which we didn’t know how to operate until we asked), and the nearest supercharger was 100 miles away, which we wouldn’t have made. So we ended up waiting to charge at the service center, but they tried to make us leave so they could charger other cars. Delivery experience aside, I think my car is fantastic, but after paying $60k for a car, they should at least provide more quality control. This is definitely something Tesla could improve on to attract more customers. It definitely feels like there is a rush to push more cars to customers instead of giving better service(quality over quantity, you know). If they could improve on this, this will do so much for them.

TeslaMotors,I want,rpvjtr,hq6qv0g,t3_rpvjtr,"I *do* think that a number of long-time users have V9 rose-colored glasses (I know I do) and to your point, yes, there were a number of UX incongruencies that never really made sense in contrast to the rest of the interface—like the card for trip/pressure or the Bluetooth audio device controls being awkwardly hidden in the music menu which required a non-descript swipe up. Long-time owners have discovered these oddities and 3-years of habit have internalized them as good design. It's a ""who moved my cheese?"" scenario.

I also agree with you that the consolidation of controls is a step in the right direction—it's more intuitive and logical; **HOWEVER,** I believe that can be done without serious regressions. There are bugs that people are harping on that will be fixed, but there's really two major issues:

1. Items that used to take a single tap (wipers, driver profile, dash cam clip, seat heaters, etc.) are now buried and require 1-3 additional taps. This is fine for something that's seldom accessed or while the car is stationary, but it's not acceptable for important driver functions.
2. While I agree with you that the ""app drawer"" is an obvious nod to a future app store, it's inconceivably stupid to me that those items (every single last one of them not pertaining to vehicle functions) can be placed into the dock and customized while important vehicle functions remain buried in the menu. I cannot put my wiper control on the main screen but I can put Tesla Theater which doesn't even work while the car is in motion. That's ***stupid***.

I don't think Tesla needs to trash the entire update. It does bring improvements to the prior design; however, it does so at the expense of driver controls which is antithetical to what should be the objectives of a car that only has a screen. I don't see why Tesla couldn't have a ""parked"" and ""drive"" mode—each customizable. Why permit Arcade or Theater in the dock when the vehicle is driving? Allow users to place the functions they most want (there are people that want seat heaters accessible year-round and others that have never once turned them on and would rather have something else—let the users choose!).

The people designing this UI have ""phone UI"" brain, and not car UI brain, and its obvious. It's why most of you use your usual ""favorites"" over and over because the spotify menu is downright impossible to use while driving, at least safely. More taps to get to things you use regularly, or even semi-regularly, or related to safety are now buried because of some subjective ""logical"" groupings; it just does not clearly work.

On my Mac, things can be buried in an extra layer when they update because rarely is there such an urgency to use something as it is with a car. For teslas, more settings buried like the current version is bad, very very bad. It's less safe, and in general, doesn't work. This is not an ""new vs old"" thing, its clearly made by people who don't understand UI for super preoccupied drivers.

The solution, if they really want to keep this UI design, is to make EVERYTHING available to be put on the home menu bar, but even then, I think they really went backwards in usability and we need another re-thinking of a mix between v10 and v11.

Leave ME to decide when I want my seat heater on and when I want the climate control on, and TESLA can worry about driving matters. For Christ sake de-couple the seat heaters from the air vents. 

Let me decide where I want my icons. 

Let me decide what to bury, like all the useless entertainment and video game stuff I'll never use instead of putting it on the main icon row. (admittedly the Netflix has been nice while waiting to pick up my kids at sports oractice, but I'm also happy if Netflix is buried behind 2 taps because I'll only use it maybe a few times per month). 

The temperature controls are so dim they're useless on the bottom of the screen.  When I wonder ""what's my car temperature at?"" it's literally impossible to read with a glance down while I'm driving Becuase it's so dim. 

The icons themselves now are cartoony and don't actually resemble anything useful to be able to decipher what they're for. 

The dashcam button... That thing you don't need until you need it *now*... Buried to the point it's useless. 

The profiles buttons... That thing you need to tap every time you get into the car if there were two drivers... Buried.

>My main question is whether I need the dual-motor AWD. I live in the Chicago area, so I'm concerned about potentially driving a rear wheel drive car in the snow and ice. Is RWD a real option for rough winters, or should I only consider the AWD models?

I live close by in metro Detroit on hilly dirt roads. I got the AWD, but after feeling the amazing TC ok this car, I think the RWD would have been fine. If you have snow tires you'd have 0 issues imo. If price is no object, I'd still get RWD. I got an inventory car, only way I could afford AWD. 

>Secondly, how important is the self-driving/autopilot? I can see how it would be useful for long car trips, but I don't really take long car trips. Would I regret getting a model that doesn't have it?

This is very personal. Will you never go on a road trip? Having had it for a while, I wouldn't want to live without it. Even for short stretches of road it's a life changer (imo).

>I guess it all boils down to whether I could get away with a bare-bones, RWD Model 3 with no added bells and whistles, or whether I'd at least need the AWD for the winters. And if I'm looking at the price point around $55-60k, would it make more sense to look at a used Model S?

You'd be fine with a 3. I personally wouldn't want an S. I don't want to take a multi year loan out on a car that's already several years old, and you probably won't get ap2.5/3 which would be sad. Again, pretty personal. S is a totally different car.

Optioned out with the largest battery, highest performance, leather, etc., expect to pay upwards of $50,000. Obviously you don't need that much if you're going to finance and/or trade in.

2. Yes. The ramp up to production is going to be fairly slow. Tesla is expected to produce around 100,000 Model 3's it's first full year of production. Within 3 years of that, upwards of 500,000 vehicles should be rolling off the assembly lines. If Tesla opens the Model 3 up for preorders, make sure you preorder the moment that happens. If you wait until release, you could very well end up waiting well over a year for the car upon placing your order. Save around $2k by early next year for a potential pre-order. $5k if you think you might want to pre-order the highest trim.

3. Selling separately is always the best way to go in my opinion since it usually will result in more money. Tesla currently offers a trade-in program through AutoNation.

4. I think this is something important to consider. It's not entirely important that there is one in your immediate area, but look for ones that are less than 200 miles away in directions you might often travel. If a Supercharger doesn't exist in those directions, travel with your new car could prove to be more difficult than normal.

TeslaMotors,I want,2aye6h,cj0a7ap,t3_2aye6h,"I posted this in the other thread that linked to yours.  Your situation may or may not be the same, but I'll re-post it anyways just to give some perspective and info if you need it.  Here it is:

""Please be financially secure before considering a new car purchase. Get a job, your own place, and set up student loan payments prior to working on a new car payment.

The real world is tough, and right now I don't think you have a proper grasp of how much everything costs and how issues arise. My apologies for making assumptions about you, I'm just going off my own experience and that of others. Young people in college (including me just a few years ago) just don't seem to grasp all the little things to pay for in the real world. Rent, food, and spending money are not everything. You need insurance (both for housing, car, and health), retirement contributions, emergency funds for random things (again, house, care, health, family trouble, etc), payments for utilities/cable, etc, etc. That adds up quickly. If you have a girlfriend (or expensive wife, in my case), you need to take that into account.

Also, it is going to be VERY hard to get financing as a first time car buyer for an expensive car. I know this first hand because my upcoming delivery of a Model S in October is going to be my first ""new car"" purchase. I'm still worried about getting approval for the loan considering I have a mortgage and student loan debt. I have good credit (700+), but a lot of outstanding loans and payments already. I'm an attorney so I have a high salary (6 figures+), and this purchase is still quite a stretch for me.

Model 3 is going to be maybe $35K AFTER federal/state tax breaks and with NO options. That really means $45-$50K, and if you want the tech package, supercharger, and any other add-ons it is really $50-$60K. With financing at a higher rate (since you are new owner, probably 4%+), as well as gap insurance, your payments could be $500-$1000+ a month depending on options and down payment. Insurance will be another $100-$200 a month.

Honestly, I highly doubt a bank or credit union is going to approve you for a $40K+ loan unless you show a good income, low amount of debt, good credit history, have a large downpayment (20%+), and/or have a co-signer.

Suggestions if you really want the car: 
1) Build credit. Do you have a credit card? If not, get one and use is sparingly. Many banks have credit-building cards for college students. You need to have a credit history of 3+ years with ALL timely payments and no derogatory marks. You need to keep your credit utilization LOW (as in, maybe 20% of total balance). 
2) Save up a lot for down payment. Don't assume you will get money from trade in on that BMW. Something could go wrong, you could have an accident, or that thing could be worth $2K by the time you can get the Model 3. 20% of $50K+ is at least $10K. Don't forget tax on the car, which is a lot here in CA - that's another $5K. Bare minimum $15K+ saved for the car. 
3) Get a job and your own place, work out a budget. Include everything in the budget. Don't try to do the ""fuzzy math"" bullshit, expecting to save money on gas or something like that. Tesla makes it sound like the cars are simple and maintenance free, but that really isn't the case. It's $600 a year to do maintenance on the Model S, unless you pre-paid so its more like $475-$500. Detailing of the car a couple times a year can be another $500. Installation of outlet can be $500+. Opti-Coat covering can be $500+. Expel clear wrap to protect paint can be $1000-$2000+.

Good luck and hit me up with any questions/concerns. Hopefully within the next few years we both can join the Tesla owner's club :-D""",dieabetic,80287.0,0.9968,False,False,False,80287.0,3709,False

My primary reasoning is that Tesla's mission of decarbonizing transport is critical for the future of our planet, and by buying more expensive options of their cars we can do our part helping them succeed in that mission. Also, we have the opportunity to be brand ambassadors and convince other people to go electric. The difference in acceleration between a 3 AWD and a 3 Performance may not matter that much in your day-to-day driving, but it may convince somebody you give a ride that electric cars can be awesome.

1. When you buy the performance package, you're essentially paying for the faster acceleration. All the other upgrades are fluff. More importantly, because the tires they put on are 100% for summer use, you will have to buy a second set of tires/wheels anyways, so that's an added cost you need to be ready for if you go P3D. Having said that, you get used to the acceleration very quickly, and I'd happily buy an even faster version. I don't at all regret having bought the performance version.

2. If you take FSD for what it currently is, a very advanced driver assist package, I think it's worth it, and it will only get better. I wouldn't buy FSD and expect the car will turn into a robotaxi (though it may), but I would buy it for much more convenient long distance and freeway driving. Just automatic lane changing alone (use the turn stalk and the car switches lanes) is worth it in my opinion, and I believe this is not part of AP anymore (see e.g. [here](https://forums.tesla.com/forum/forums/auto-lane-change-part-new-ap)). And NoAP is also starting to work quite nicely and really makes driving much less stressful. And in any case, you can be certain these features will keep improving over the next 1-2 years.",[deleted],-1.0,0.992,False,True,False,-1.0,2069,False

Otherwise, the AWD is still a very fast car and I never (yet!) use the extra top speed. The main reason the Performance feels so much crisper is the fantastic summer tires.

If you were my insured I might tell you to email a bunch of pictures to the shop. They might actually have another door shell lying around that they took off another Model 3 that might be bad but might work as a temporary substitute until your parts are in. It's possible also that they might be able to drop in a replacement glass into your damaged door, though that would depend on whether the regulator is damaged and whether they can get the door to open and close with the handle in that condition without having to cut it out.

1. Have an electrician run a 240v, 50A line to a NEMA 14-50 socket on the left side of your garage (or whatever side the driver side of your car will be on), at least two feet off the ground. You'll be able to plug the Mobile Connector that comes with your Model 3 into that, though you'll need to buy the 14-50 Adapter for it, from [here](https://shop.tesla.com/product/gen-2-nema-adapters).
2. Run a 240v, 30A line to a NEMA 14-30 socket. This is slower than a 14-50, but useful if you don't have enough room in your breaker box for an additional 50A breaker. And it'll still be plenty fast enough to charge your Model 3 overnight.
3. Run a 240v, 60A line to a Tesla Wall Connector. This will let achieve the Model 3's maximum charging speed, assuming you get a Long Range or Performance trim. Those can AC charge at up to 48A, while the SR+ is limited to 32A. And while a NEMA 14-50 socket can supply up to 40A for continuous use (80% of the maximum amperage of the circuit), the Mobile Connector is limited to 32A. That's why you want a 60A circuit for a Wall Connector: 60A * 80% = 48A.
3. If you think there's any chance that you might ever park *two* Teslas in that garage, you may want to run a 240v, 100A line out there. What that'll let you do is hook up two Tesla Wall Connectors, which can then intelligently share the available amperage while charging two Teslas at the same time. You can hook one Wall Connector up at first, then add the second later.

To make matters worse on the charging UI front, pressing 'Stop charging' doesn't work with some home chargers so the button does absolutely nothing except show you pressed it. Yet pressing unlock stops it charging and unlocks the port. (I think they actually fixed this in a recent update though?)

It could set off an alarm instead (as it already does) if it encounters a situation that it doesn't know what to do. But you'd have to be ready to take over almost immediately, something that would probably be impossible if you're focused on your laptop.

1) Detect stop signs, traffic lights and speed limit signs.

2) Detect road hazards like pot holes and road debris.

L3 is very hard, because the car needs to be able to take care of itself while waiting for the human driver to take over. This can take several seconds if the human driver has his nose buried in his phone or a book -- it takes a long time to regain situational awareness. At highway speeds the car covers a significant distance in those few seconds. Pulling over to a shoulder is actually a very difficult maneuver; shoulders are difficult to recognize well, they can have a lot of debris, traction can be poor, they may have snow banks piled on them due to plowing, etc.

Basically I'm saying don't count on this happening anytime soon. It definitely won't be the next AP feature. AP on the current generation of Tesla hardare will require the human driver to pay attention at all times for quite some time, and I would argue probably forever.

Consider that it might be sufficient if you are allowed to plug in to an existing wall outlet if you don't drive far on average, and occasionally supercharge.
You can monitor your usage using a killawatt or by monitoring your driving (take the Tesla trips figure and add 20% for charging overhead if you don't supercharge much).

Options I would consider. Be prepared for 90% to say no, but do demonstrate you will pay for the electricity and be willing to show them how to manage it for other ev owners.
* Find people with a house that is renting out an ADU (attached dwelling unit) that might let you park in the driveway and plug in to a wall outlet. Difficult but might work better than an apartment.
* Ask apartment complexes if you can pay them to plug into a wall outlet.
* Consider a home sharing arrangement where you get a garage.

The FSD didn't slow down in a raining situation and brake at last minute before cornering and also corner at higher speed than I was comfortable with.  I had to take over because I was afraid the tire will slip during cornering.  I've pushed the video icon so hopefully tesla sees it.

I hope the next or future beta would incorporate more logic into it.  When wiper is moving, the car should not treat the condition as if it was driving on the dry pavement.  Not everyone has good tires.

Same for driving in snow.  I'm sure camera would be able to recognize some white stuff around the car and should drive slower than normal posted speed and leave plenty room for stop.  Cars should be able to detect slips during driving so maybe they can add that as a way to detect the road condition and act accordingly like a human driver.  Heck, Tesla even have cell signal in most area and should be able to check weather report or radar for weather condition where the car is.

I'll continue to use it whenever I can and send the video of forced disengagement of FSD so tesla will have more data to improve FSD.",Caterpillar69420,17874.0,0.9297,False,False,False,17874.0,1552,False

I was basically set on Tesla being the only thing I wanted to do, and somehow I was able to make it happen (a couple years later than I wanted, admittedly, but it's still my dream job).

Roofing will be different that solar installations, I'd recommend going the solar route over pure roofing. The market for certifications is decently big and there's bound to be plenty of options for training there since it's a relatively nascent industry compared to roofing, so easier to get a foot in the door. I'd start looking at certification programs in your area NOW. That's the next step imo. Main benefit of solar vs roofing is electrical experience, that's definitely going to be something we need. Also, solar shingles will be manufactured differently than traditional shingles, so there may not be much overlap with traditional roofing except for it being manual labor at height.

Second, solar roofs vs solar panels are both going to be a significant chunk of the Tesla Energy brand, since they address different markets (already built roofs get panels, decaying roofs or new buildings get solar shingles), so if you get panel installation experience your opportunity to get in the door will be better.

Also, I'm not sure how it works/worked on the solar installation side, but I know with Tesla home charger installations we have a network of electricians, so the installers aren't Tesla employees. That may already be different on the solar side and given our history of vertical integration it may change, but I'd look into this, and don't exclude working out of a local contractor anyways because the experience will be valuable.

Don't worry about non-relevant experience too much, we mainly want hard workers who are passionate and can do the job. If you spend some time taking some classes and getting experience, maintain your vision and continue making progress every single week, you'll get to where you need to be.

I went 2.5 years between first application and hire, but I very much enjoyed that time and learned a ton, so don't sweat if it's not happening as fast as you want.

Of course theres a chance that Tesla will partner with 3rd party roofers to install the solar roofs but I don't see that happening, at least not at first, considering how vertically integrated Tesla tends to be.

I think its great that you're inspired to install solar roofs. It's too rare that people are inspired in this way and actually act on it.

The solar roofing panels have existed for quite some time, so it wasn't like it was an amazing new thing to be presenting. It was ""why wouldn't you"" because we already know it works, and if the price is right...why wouldn't you?!

>Maybe this is an unnecessary detail

Yup. That's an overshare.

>I want to put solar roofs on houses.

You're going to need some state licenses then. Probably going to need an electricians apprenticeship behind you if you do the electrical work. You're going to need to apprentice as a carpenter if you're thinking of building roofs, and you're probably going to need some experience if you're going to lay solar material.

The _good_ news is, you can do any of those things. And since Tesla is probably going to do solar roofs in the Solar City model, you can almost certainly apply for a job with a local installer shop. From what I understand, they train installers to do what they need, so maybe you can get in now doing panels and whatnot, and as solar roofs start to get sold you can go out on those jobs.

**BUT**, and this is no bullshit. From experience. You need to get your depression under control. If you aren't seeing a professional, you need to start. If you need medication and aren't taking it, you need to start. If you think roofing is going to make you happy, fine. But you aren't looking at it with any connection to reality.

Roofing is no joke. You're going to work your ass off all day, directly in the sun, 5+ days a week, from the ass crack of dawn 'till dusk. And if you think your crew is going to have any patience for moping around, or waiting for you to wake up, you're way off base. Every single trade worker I've ever known has been super hard working, a self starter, an early riser, and they don't mess around when it comes to getting on the job. There's also a _lot_ of joking at the expense of crew members. So if you're likely to get your feelings hurt by 5 guys picking on you all day, you're going to need to get some thicker skin.

Also, roofers don't get paid well for the very hard work they do. Even electricians don't get paid _that_ well unless they work in a very busy union shop. Starting out with no experience, you should expect low pay. Like, $10-15/hr. Top electricians can probably expect $20-30/hr. A master electrician can expect more, but will have several journeymen under them making them angry most of the day. :)

Anyway, where to start? Start installing solar panels on roofs probably. Apply for a Solar City job doing that, and hopefully they'll continue using the same model when solar roofing is available. Here's a link. http://www.solarcity.com/careers/operations/join-our-team

I think the 3 is an incredible car, its pretty common in CA but I feel I would go for a new LR 3 over a used pre raven S. The new 3 charges quicker, has much better range vs a 75 S. Handling on the 3 is more fun due to its size. Interior passenger space isnt all that much different in a S and 3, but you do lose trunk space. I actually prefer the pop out screen of the 3 vs the built in screen of the X because its easier to reach while driving but the con is that it doesnt have the sleek integrated look. New 3 / Y would be my recommendation. You really want the most range you can get, a 75 S will struggle to get over 200 miles in real driving range.

Tesla's website has a filter to show which cars have FSD enabled on purchase.

In fact, this link is for Model S with FSD made in 2017.

https://www.tesla.com/inventory/used/ms?VehicleHistory=CLEAN&AUTOPILOT=AUTOPILOT_FULL_SELF_DRIVING&Year=2017&arrangeby=plh&zip=33563

*However*, the site lacks information on whether the car as AP 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, etc.  If you go to a site like ev-cpo on the other hand, you can narrow results more accurately: https://ev-cpo.com/hunter/

In this case, the site can point me to a vehicle like this one: https://www.tesla.com/used/5YJSA1E20HF218281 which was built in 2017, and has AP 2.5 in it.  Since it has the FSD package it is automatically eligible for the HW 3.0 upgrade.

When buying used from Tesla make sure to consider shipping costs.

I went through this effort to buy a used 2017 Model X 100D and used EV-CPO.com to review pricing history (Needs premium access, but that's free with verification of not being a business).  There was an X in Tampa that peaked my interest for $75,600.  I then saw a similar X in Burbank, California for $71,400.  Only real difference was a lack of white seats, and distance.  As I am in Tampa though, this meant paying about $2,000 to ship the vehicle from Burbank to Tampa.  This put the car up to $73,400.  Still cheaper than if I bought from Tampa though. 

In the three days it took for me to get my finances in order the X dropped to $70,400, and in looking at the price history I saw another price drop was about to hit.  So I slept on it, and it dropped to $70,000.  This means that for $72,000 I bought an X with only 5,000 miles more on it than the one that was $75,600 in Tampa, even after shipping I came out $3,600 cheaper.  Know what I can use those savings on?  The new MCU2+tuner upgrade (I go to drive in movies, the tuner is nice to have in the car), which is $3,000.  Plus I can more easily get the windows tinted now as well with the remaining $600 savings.

https://www.tesla.com/used/5YJSA1E29HF185782 this guy here, for example, already has AP 3.0 installed in it, and has FSD upgraded already.

Once you find a used car you like, or in my case a list of them, you can also reach out to the Used Tesla sales people and they can confirm whether or not the vehicle already has the MCU2 upgrade.  This is rare to find in a used vehicle.

Just keep in mind, while you're shopping around, that the cars do *not* last long.  I sweat a lot going to sleep that night hoping my Model X would see a price drop, and it didn't drop when I woke up.  But the price history thing showed the price drops normally occur at around 6:30-7am and again at noon-1pm EST.

Took delivery a couple of weeks ago. Logistics mistook my home delivery as a pick-up, but drove the car out to my house (phone IVR kept redirecting me in a loop, and the DS was unreachable, so I had to wait until they reached out to me). Car functioned properly, and the employee gave us a fairly complete walkthrough, but it was too dark to do much visual inspection (panels and trim lined up, seats worked, and upholstery looked good). We accepted it, but found some superficial damage to the front bumper, a couple of defect in the windshield, and some other cosmetic issues the next day. 

It's difficult to get anyone on the phone, so I stopped at Service Center a couple of days later. They said that they could fix the issues (and that they would have swapped cars for us if it was anything more significant). I have an appointment for them to replace the bumper and windshield, and touch up paint.

There's definitely room to improve in the experience, but it wasn't a ""bad"" experience. Tesla's Service Center has been fairly easy to deal with. From what friends have told me of their past interactions, Tesla is pretty good about making things right.

Correct. The ITC applies because you are using it to store power generated by solar panels. The option to time-shift grid power won't even be there in the app.

I've been told you can use it however you like once you've already received the credit, which makes sense. But you would have to get Tesla to enable that feature.

>Does the federal ITC rebate cover just the powerwall itself? Or the total cost? Such as other equipment, installation costs, permits, and taxes too? I tried googling that, and some sites say the ITC covers ""total cost"" but I don't know what 'total cost' means. Everything? Or just total equipment cost?

The full invoice. I've heard even roof repairs/replacement can qualify if the installer deemed it necessary. 

You already have solar? How long was it installed? The IRS clarification in 2018 stated it must be installed within a year of the solar panels to qualify.

>The California rebate is what I'm very confused about. From what I've read, Tesla maxed out the rebate, and I must go through a 3rd party in order to qualify. But when looking into that, I've seen many people say 3rd party installers that do qualify for these rebates often mislead customers by including the value of the rebate in the quote, or they claim it. I'm not sure about the truthfulness of these claims, so I'd love to see if anyone has first hand experience with the SGIP with Tesla (if that's even possible anymore) or a 3rd party.

We had a Camry hybrid. While it was durable it was not all that good of a car. Typical hybrid, power delivery was always delayed as the motor had to start. Stop lights were always odd, engine off, step on the gas, car moves then car shakes as engine starts.

However, there is a decent chance that Tesla will release a car with full (or at least 99%) ~~autopilot~~ self-driving capabilities in the next couple of years. Kimbal Musk said in an interview that Tesla already has a prototype that can ~~run autopilot~~ drive itself in the city, so if you want full self-driving capabilities, you may be able to get it in a few years. Cars coming out TODAY have what Tesla calls ""autopilot"", which will allow the car to drive itself on the highway and on private property, but not in the city.

2. Yes. Every Tesla that came off the production line after September 2014 has the hardware for autopilot. 

3. Yes. Tesla is planning a re-launch of the Roadster. It will have all-wheel-drive. We barely known anything about it yet, but there's a short snippet about it in Ashlee Vance's biography on Elon:

For context, Konstantin Othmer is a software engineer an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley who took delivery of the 10th Model S.
 
> *Othmer has lined up to be the lucky owner of the first Roadster II. Musk has developed an unconventional policy to determine the order in which cars are sold. When a new car is announced and its price is set, a race begins in which the first person to hand Musk a check gets the first car. With the Model S, Steve Jurvetson, a Tesla board member, had a check at the ready in his wallet and slid it across the table to Musk after spying details on the Model S in a packet of board meeting notes.*

> *Othmer caught a* Wired *story about a planned second version of the Roadster and emailed Musk right away. ""He said, 'Okay, I will sell it to you, but you have to pay two hundred thousand dollars right now.'"" Othmer agreed, and Tesla had him come to the company's headquarters on a Sunday to sign some paperwork, acknowledging the price of the car and the fact that the company didn't quite know when it would arrive or what its specifications would be. ""My guess is that it will be the fastest car on the road,"" Othmer said. ""It'll be four-wheel drive. It's going to be insane. And I don't really think that will be the real price.

There may be an upgraded version of it that gets better range, but it probably won't be enough to make a substantial difference on road trips. Anything over 200 or so miles and you are probably going to want to supercharge anyway, and then it becomes about charge rate more than maximum range.

As fro autopilot, every Model S coming out of the factory at this point has the hardware for it, so as they develop the software systems, (and work through the legal issues), it should update over the air.

Elon:   

>* Our letter says most of it. We'll spend extra time on Q&A. Answer as many questions as possible.  
> * Most excited about our rapid increase in output. Over 3,000 packs/week at the gigafactory. Peak hour would be ~ 5,000 cars/week  
>* We were able to do this with minimal capex  
> * We're seeing ways to improve volume with min capex by simplifying production line  
> * We also found that there are some things suited for manual operation... and some more suited for automated operation. The two should not be confused. A vast part of the production is automated.  
> * We had these fiberglass mats on the top of the battery pack, basically fluff, we tried to automate the placement and fluff to the top of the battery pack which is ridiculous. Machines are not good at picking up pieces of fluff. Hands are way better at doing that. Using a vision system. Then I asked, ""Do we actually need that?""  
> * The line kept breaking down because the 'fluffer bot' failed to pick it up. One of the silliest things I've found.  
> * Over generalizing the design, car battery pack has a port for the front drive units. We put a sealed blanking plate over the hole, and would do that for all RWD cars. Adds cost, etc. And it's unnecessary. 
> * We've had a radical improvement in battery production. 7 hours to make a pack to under 17 minutes.  
> * 3,000 vehicles a week sustained rate in the body shop. Which is mostly automated. General assembly soon. Proud of the team. Lots of hard work/sacrifice. 
> * The market share is almost the best selling sedan in the USA as of April and will certainly be there in May. Good chance the Model 3 gets 30-40% market share. Seems likely later this year.  Very encouraging since they're more established brands.  
> * confident about positive cash flow in Q3. Not a certainty but it does appear quite likely in my view.
> * Restructuring the company this month and make sure we're well set up to achieve that goal. 
> * Scrubbing the barnacles on the # of contracting companies they're working with.

Q&A:  

> * 5 day 2 shift operation is a ridiculous way to operate. Not a good use of CAP EX. They've always operated on a 24/7 basis. Exception is general assembly which is a 2-3 shift schedule. 5-6 day 20 hr shift. Paint which is a 6 day basis. We don't have the seesaw of inventory between different shops. We have to reduce work in progress. If the shifts aren't aligned you have to build up inventory in a warehouse. We're using the chip fab approach. Alternate work week. I do believe that the path to manufacturing efficiency is velocity and density. You can't have 0 maintenance time. Equipment upgrades. etc. 
> * 2nd question was long. someone can fill it in :)  Was hard to hear it all.
> * Starlink --> 3 years, I haven't thought that the cars can connect to the satellites but probably.  
> * We have the 2 biggest factories on earth between the giga and fremont. Giga is still slightly smaller than fremont but not for long.  General assembly is biggest risk. Paint shop is 2nd biggest risk. Production is primarily a software problem. Tesla > any other car company at software. **Model Y will be a manufacturing revolution. Incredible. Because we don't want to go through this pain again.**
> * Yes. Q4 we expect 20% gross margin. Next year definitely 25%. 
> * Comment on Jim's departure? I don't find server chip design that interesting but Jim does. We don't' plan to hire a replacement for Jim's position.  
> * boring bonehead questions are not cool.
> * **We're going to go to youtube. sorry. these questions are so dry. They're killing me.**   hilarious. 
> * Full autonomy. We're making really good progress on that front. Current production are capable of full autonomy. Maybe needed is a CPU upgrade to have more processing power for the neural net. But that's a plug n play process that's easy to do. Timing? Regulatory Approval makes it tricky. Autonomy doesn't reduce death rates to zero but improves it. How many do you read about? Basically none of them. Rants about inflammatory headlines from journalists reporting about autonomous vehicles. If the press is hounding the regulators... and the public is worried it's not safe because misleading press... this is where the challenge occurs. People might read something... turn if off.. and then die. So I'm really upset by this. **From a technical standpoint we'll probably be ready by the end of 2019.**  Reuters report is based on NOTHING. **We won't start Model Y production until 2020 is a more likely prospect. Production location has not been decided. We're really crowded here. Jammed to the gills. So it WON'T be in FREMONT.**  Laughs about Daimler CEO, ""i studied physics in college!! Chuckle!!"".  **We could do a 500 mile semi TODAY. Production will probably be above 600 mile range.**  *This kid sounds like he was in his 20s and elon loves his questions*.  We could design packs that could charge fast but it's a tradeoff for the customer. It's more important to have long range than it is to have super fast charge times. We'll keep going if they're interesting. *(girl tried to cut off the kid!!!! HAHA)*  What matters is the pace of innovation. Gives Amazon vs Walmart comparison. We made our semi cool and sexy.. but not because it affects the customers in any suitable way. They care more about cost.   That's hilarious that Nikola is suing Tesla. The Irony. No one is buying a semi because how it looks!!!! It will take quite a way of revenue from railway.. Essentially they just platoon with a bunch of rail cars. I think platooning of trucks will affect the rail industry in a negative way.  The AU battery farm has responded better than any hydrocarbon plant. Responds quite fast. The same rapid response is true of the battery pack. Customers love it. I feel confident that we'll be able to announce ____- at the gigawatt scale within a couple of months. There's more than enough demand for solar/battery systems. Our longer term strategy is to catch up on our powerwall demand. 
> * Tesla Semi Reservations? I don't know how many we have. About 2,000? It's not like there's an ongoing sales effort. Sales are opportunistic. Companies approaching us. Our focus is on the Model 3. We need to become a profitable company. Model Y will be amazing. Tesla Pickup. We have way more cool things than we know what to do. We just need to stay focused rather than divide our attention on too many projects. **Probably decide on a 2nd manufacturing facility later this year. Not later than Q4. We expect to announce a Tesla Gigafactory in China soon. In the future, all gigafactory will also include manufacturing production.** Is happy chinese government will allow them to have full ownership of a factory.
> * Autopilot data --> We do see a steady increase in the use of autopilot. 1/3 of highway miles are on autopilot. it dips with negative press articles. And then we get accused of blaming the victim. **We'll be publishing our safety statistics on a quarterly basis so people know exactly how safe autopilot is.**  
> * The autopilot accidents are always 'experienced users'... it's not a lack of understanding but better yet becoming too complacent with it.
> * Can i get updated when you hit 3000/4000/week etc on the model 3? I think the news will leak pretty quickly.. and people track registrations pretty closely partly due to shipments and vehicle registrations. People get too focused on what's happened in the space of a few weeks/months.  Should be focused on long term things. We have no interest in satisfying the desires of day traders. Please sell our stock and don't buy it. Do not buy it if volatility is scary. 
> * Been tracking the trade-ins. Been seeing a wide range of cars. Were not necessarily owners of c-class mercedes or bmws. Once full autonomy comes.. the cost drops dramatically since you can share that car with others.

When i started looking at cars in the err higher end price range(100k USD), I always thought i would just buy a new Nissan Skyline R35, or a Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat, because that's what ive always enjoyed.

 When a friend suggested a Tesla i laughed it off a bit, then started looking at them. Wow, the transition i have gone through in my way of thinking is quite substantial. I had it narrowed down to a few cars, and every time i thought about which one to get, I seriously cannot justify ANY other car, the only thing that comes close is the Skyline, and that's only because it is, in fact, a skyline; that is the only defense it has.

You're clearly talking about integrating the driving assist features into your normal human driving, and that's a very good idea. I often use cruise control for driving in the city and just keep my foot on the brake, waiting for a red light or something, it works surprisingly well (though sometimes I wish the brake and gas pedals were reversed).

 I brake when I need to stop or slow down, then instantly reactivate cruise control with the button. I barely ever touch the gas besides launching. There is no noise or anything when you hit the button, it's super smooth. It rides so smoothly I almost consider it a form of self driving - the car drives itself most of the time, and the rest of the time I'm making the exact inputs that I imagine Google or Tesla's car would. So I can say without a shadow of a doubt that autopilot can work in the city.

Does Tesla autopilot still maintain cruising speed if you jerk the steering wheel, or does it actually start slowing down? If so, you could just make your steering adjustment, then punch the button. Also, you could punch the button to do a perfect launch from a traffic light every time, like I've seen on some Mercedes etc. 

That would handle almost everything in the city, except abrupt stops like parked cars, stop signs and red lights, but you just hit the brake for those. Turns usually happen immediately after a stop, or a traffic light which you need to take control for anyway.

This is something new?  You think that company management should give higher priority to someone other than the owners who hired management to run the company for the benefit of shareholders?

Comments so far:

The weather display is cool, and the app looks great in both light and dark mode but some screens use the blurred weather background and others use the solid light/dark background. I get that it’s lists vs display screens, but it feels a bit inconsistent visually. 

I like the use of Face ID, but it would be cool if the app could optionally wait to lock after a couple minutes instead of instantly. Would just make switching back and forth between it and another app a bit smoother.

This is not true. Plenty of roads in America that are poorly maintained and marked. And the international problem is a huge challenge, even if a company has the technology working for an area. You have to teach a vehicle driving culture. This goes way beyond the discussion of radar. 


>		. weather: there’s a reason vision has limitations, its because its limited to what it can see !! and Radar/LIDAR isn’t. I don’t care how much computing power you use or how many cameras, you are never ever in a million billion years going to be able to ‘see’ in a whiteout or at night, or when its raining or foggy or a hundred other situations, as well as you could with a cheap radar. There’s a reason the military with billions of R&D dollars doesn’t say ‘hey we’re gonna abandon our night vision IR goggles and radar tech and just use camera !!’

Radar had/has a narrow range of use in vehicles. LIDAR, to my knowledge, would suffer the same issues as vision in inclement weather, nor would I let myself or the vehicle drive in said conditions. The military has to be ready to operate in all conditions, hence everything they use to do so. 

I rely on my vision and knowledge each day when I drive. If I can do it, so can a computer with cameras. The question is more of when and not if. It may be 20 years out for all I know. But it is possible, as millions of drivers do so daily.

TeslaMotors,better,dbk05o,f22aj4c,t3_dbk05o,"If you want to do a quick worst-case scenario calculation, the maximum power draw from the Model 3 cabin heater is about 6.5 kW.  1 hour of driving at max heat will consume an additional 6.5 kWh, or about 9%/hour above what's required to drive with the heat off (for the LR pack).

#EDIT
Apparently I sparked a flurry of discussion with my 6.5 kW comment.  I went back and measured a bunch of different scenarios while plugged into a 48A HPWC.  Short of tapping the CAN bus, you can effectively measure total power draw in one of three ways:

1) Plug in with a full charge, then look at the Power value (this is rounded, so your resolution is limited to 1 kW)

2) Plug in with a full charge, then multiply the Amps & Volts values with climate on (both are rounded to nearest integer, so your resolution is ~200 W (1A*200V nominal)

3) Start charging with all HVAC off and measure the charge rate (km/hr) at the lowest current setting (5A) and then the highest current (48A), then plot the intercept to find power draw at a theoretical 0.0 mi/hr.  This will not correspond to 0kW but to some fixed value representing the base power draw of the computers and charging circuitry.  My test tonight for the particular charger I was on came up with a formula of (Power in kW) = (Rate in km/hr)*0.1634 + 0.2775 kW  

https://imgur.com/FH3U5EV

Using method 3, the base kW technically still has a margin of error of +/- 100W (the true current draw could be off by up to 0.5A either way * 200V), but assuming the current draw remains fixed, if you pull charge_rate from the API (accurate to 0.1 mi/hr) you can then use the charge rate to measure additional auxiliary power draw changes to a resolution of as little as 25W.

Using this formula I tested a bunch of permutations involving Max Defrost mode, fan speeds, auto/fixed temperature modes with/without AC, rear defroster, seat heaters, etc.  I'll spare the detailed data, but the general conclusion I drew is that the peak power draw of all climate systems combined (fan, cabin heater, AC, seat heaters, rear/mirror defrost) could theoretically be as high as **9.85 kW** but it won't remain that high as after a few minutes of steady state operation the car does an excellent job of balancing power draws of each system to maintain the set temperatures without wasting excess energy.

#Some specific data points I measured by sampling power draws once per second and averaging at least 60s: 

* Base power draw of computers awake + charger: **277 W** (less if not charging)
* Rear Defroster only (also activates side mirror defrosters): **446 W**
* Both Front Seat Heaters at Hi only: **136 W**
* Both Front Seat Heaters at Med only: **110 W**
* Both Front Seat Heaters at Low only: within margin of error of 0 W (possibly because I tested Hi,Med,Low sequentially and they were already warm)
* Fan only (temp set to Lo, AC set to Off): **<50 W** up to setting 6, **82 W** at 7, **129 W** at 8, **197 W** at 9, **343 W** at 10 (the fan power draw is an exponential curve)
* Fan 10 + Temp Lo + AC On: **2.265 kW** peak, suggesting AC alone is **1.922 kW** peak
* Fan 10 + Temp Hi + AC On: **8.135 kW** peak, **7.868 kW** average
* Fan 10 + Temp Hi + AC Off: **7.472 kW** peak, **5.368 kW** average
* Max Defrost mode (AC unknown): **7.735 kW** peak, **6.762 kW** average
* Auto Hi (stationary, 4.5°C ambient, AC On): **6.625 kW** average
* Auto 22°C (stationary, 4.5°C ambient, AC On): **2.112 kW** average

The above figures are probably somewhat inaccurate due to the less-than-rigorous nature of my testing.  Power draws by auxiliary systems will be even harder to gauge while moving, but can be expected to be higher than stationary draws at the same temperature due to the airflow over the large glass roof removing heat more quickly.  

Enabling the windshield defrost vents will draw more power than setting vents to auto (usually main vent/footwell only) since it blows that heat higher into the cabin and more energy is lost to the glass, so defrost should be spared unless you need to actually defrost the windshield.",Wugz,28950.0,0.9761,False,False,False,28950.0,4072,False

Second time in a model x. The model x was the most difficult. But when driving during the winter you only need to keep a few things in mind. Always drive and charge on a warm battery. Your car is desperately trying to heat the battery and a cold battery is less efficient. So charge immediately at arrival. And while plugged in preheat the car. Your app should have a precondition button when it's cold? I tried using the seat heater method but when it's that cold it doesn't work. I just manually adjust my HVAC and have it directed at the floor and face only. My navigation did an absolute perfect job at estimating range and arrival range. I never once had a problem making it to my next super charger. If I can do it on my model x 75d you should be able to handle it in a 3...

TeslaMotors,better,dbk05o,f234twr,t3_dbk05o,"I agree completely, but I suspect it's also challenging, because the faster you drive, the higher the wind-chill on the car and the more the heater needs to work to keep up.  Precipitation in the cold will also pull a lot of heat out of the car, since water has a high specific heat and even more heat required to melt ice/snow.

One worst-case rule of thumb I use is 1.5 miles for each battery percent (for the long range 3).  Even driving through cold Minnesota winters at 80mph with two bikes strapped to the car, you can get 1.5 miles per %.

Also, remember that driving over 65mph dramatically increases drag and also wind chill.  Remember that seat warmers keep you warmer with less energy than the HVAC heating system.

The limiting factor is likely cash, in turn, leading to a lack of resources.

It would take a LOT of cash to open the necessary amount of shops, plus stock them with inventory, plus hire people to do the work.

This is one downside to the non-dealership model. It would be cash straight out of Tesla's pocket to open, run and maintain these things.

However, there will be a breaking point. Whether it be through people straight up refusing to buy the cars because the don't feel like they can rely on it, or people turning their cars in and moving on to something else. Or a combination.

The model of 'sell as many cars as we can now than work out the kinks later' isn't sustainable. Especially now that we're talking about peoples primary form of transportation.

It was 'ok' for the S/X, when owners typically had a second and third vehicle to fall back on if their car was down for multiple weeks. It was a luxury. Now they're in a market where people rely on these things as their only mode of transportation.

The biggest bottle neck I think was the availability of parts during the mad rush to increase M3 production rate. Now that is done, the replacement parts should be more available. 

Service tracking was also a big issue in part because of the long wait time and things get forgotten, 

Most of the other issues were secondary to those, for example, if every car that comes for service is down for 2-3 month, then availability of loaners become an issue. 

There was also a problem with staff training and organization, high turn over, etc. that is all because it is a rapidly expanding company, if you are running a BMW dealership your 10 people working in the service department probably have just one new guy, but at Tesla you have 7 or 8 new guys.

Mass spectrometry measures the mass to charge ratio of ions as they travel through an instrument, usually under high vacuum. Mass specs typically sample the material directly and analyze it ""destructively"" meaning the original sample cannot be recovered or reused. Mass spec imaging is a real technique, but uses the same principles as above to analyze samples such as tissue slices. It does this by raster scanning the sampling volume across the material surface.
What you may instead want to look into is imaging spectroscopy, infrared imaging, or two photon spectroscopy. These have the potential to distinguish molecule types at a distance and have potential applications in explosives detection.

> thrusters [...] would serve little purpose for what you'd be trying to accomplish.

Your claim is plain wrong, as it misses the following advantages of thrusters:

- **Thrusters in the back of a racing car:** can help accelerate much faster than current grip and the engines would enable. For example a 750 kg-force thruster would accelerate a 1,500 kg racing car by an extra ~0.5 gees - which would be a *significant* advantage adding several hundred HPs to the effective power of the engine.
- **Thrusters in the front of a racing car:** would also help brake much faster than grip would allow - even with aggressive aero there's a significant limit to braking efficiency at lower velocities. For example 750 kg-force of thrust in the front of a 1,500 kg racing car would add 0.5 gees of braking force - a significant advantage.
- **Thrusters on the side of a racing car:** can help even faster cornering by reducing the negative effects of body roll and increasing effective grip. For example if a 1,500 kg racing car can take a corner with 2 gees, then 750 kg-force of side thrust would allow an increase in cornering velocity of about 20-30% (!).
- **Thrusters can also improve stability**, they can help a car [that has already slipped](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwjHimvKNq8) - and even racing cars slip, no driver is perfect.
- **Thrusters will also work much better in rain races:** because when grip is achieved through tires, downforce is multiplied by the coefficient of static friction (μ), which is 0.7-0.9 for dry roads but can be as low as 0.1-0.4 for wet roads, which can reduce grip by a factor of 3. Thrusters on the other hand are not limited by the coefficient of static friction (μ), their force is applied to the car *directly*, so their force is not affected by slippery surfaces.

____

**TL;DR:** You are wrong, thrusters have *numerous* advantages when installed on racing cars.

Take your Model 3 to a friend's house and try charging it there and see if their voltage is as low as your 234v no load voltage, and if it droops to 231v during charging.  Does that trigger the oscillation?

The largest cost-item in an EV is the battery, and at this point very few EV-manufacturers (Tesla, for sure; are there *any* others?) have already created their own battery factories that are already churning out giga-watt-hours/year.

TeslaMotors,problem,9s5rvt,e8njip5,t3_9s5rvt,"If the credit is not extended, it will be an issue on the margin, driving away customers for whom the $7500 back was critical to the purchasing decision.  But many of Tesla's target demographic are in a position to care about quality over price, and that extends even down to the still-hypothetical $35k Model 3.

The value proposition for a prospective customer will be thus:

* Model 3 at full sticker price
* Any other EV + $7500

At current levels of technological progress, Tesla still wins that in almost all cases.  A new BMW i3 will set you back around $44k with zero options, and almost everyone will want at least some.  Figure $49k.  My Model 3 was $55k (LR, AWD).  If the reality is allowed to happen in which the subsidy expires for Tesla but not for other manufacturers, that's the equivalent of around $43k for the i3 vs. $55k for the Model 3.  Many people will still choose the Model 3.

The competition will be more of a threat at the low end, where a new Nissan LEAF, for example, could see the $7500 be a solid part of the price of the car.  However, check this table out:

[http://evadoption.com/ev-sales/federal-ev-tax-credit-phase-out-tracker-by-automaker/](http://evadoption.com/ev-sales/federal-ev-tax-credit-phase-out-tracker-by-automaker/)

Nissan already has 125k U.S. sales and is projected to hit their limit by 2021.  I actually think they'll hit their limit sooner than that because the credit will give them a temporary sales boost during the period in which their buyers get it and Tesla's don't.  Even if there's no uptick in Nissan sales, though, well, that means (i) there's no evidence in that case that Nissan cannibalized any Tesla sales, and (ii) they still only get the taxpayer-subsidized training wheels for 3 years that Tesla doesn't.  Assuming they *do* cannibalize some Tesla sales in the short term, which I think is likely, then they'll probably hit 200,000 in 2020.  Then what?

The other EV manufacturers with much lower totals (and which are therefore likely to preserve eligibility for the tax credit much longer) primarily have lower totals because their EV offerings are, quite frankly, embarrassments to their brands.  No sane Tesla VP or anyone else charged with corporate strategy is seriously worried yet about EV competition from Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Volkswagen, etc.  (Can you even *name* the credit-eligible vehicle(s) from any of those manufacturers without Googling?)  Others of those manufacturers are trying to outdo Tesla on the high end (e.g., Porsche) and are not serious mass market competition.  They don't even have ambitions to be--they never have.

I have had family in town twice now where we had no vehicles where we could all ride together. I didn't question why cars that transport less than 7 people exist or who would be dumb enough to buy them. We bought the car that makes the most sense for us 99.99% of the time, and rented a mini van for those 2 weeks.

Oh electric vehicles how you've failed us!"" if it makes more sense to buy an EV for the 99.999% of the time it's better, but occasionally use/rent a car when it makes that trip easier.

If an ICE car takes 5 hours off your trip to Nana's for Christmas, pay the $100 out of all the money the Tesla saved you on gas, and take that to Nanas.

TeslaMotors,problem,dh68cb,f3j84t8,t3_dh68cb,"Here's the thing. It's basically an embedded flash drive. Flash memory has a lifespan based on the number of writes. It's going to wear out eventually, just like normal flash drives or SD cards. In this case, the flash is used by the Linux OS, and a majority of the writes are for OS logs. Under normal circumstances you don't need these logs. It's stuff like errors, access logs, application logs, etc. However, if something goes wrong, like the MCU crashing, it could be very helpful to see why. This might explain why they don't just disable the logs altogether.  

Even replacing with a better eMMC chip is just going to prolong the issue, it's still a weak link. A better option may have been to offload the logs to a separate flash device, maybe a replaceable chip or even an easily swapped high endurance SD card.

>Are there any warnings that shows your mcu might be failing due to corrupt memory?

Basically the MCU won't work quite right, depending on what gets corrupted. Generally it will just be extra slow, or take longer to boot. 

>But what if the damage has already been done and the memory is nearing the end of its life?

That's not really how it works. There is a defined number of write cycles per sector. Just using the MCU, even with minimal logging, affects the life of the chip. If a sector goes bad it does it's best to write around the bad sector. Hard drives and SSDs have been don't this since their inception.

>Is it fair to charge someone for a problem that is already known?

It's not really any different than the SSD in your PC needing replaced, except that you have more consul over your PC. It is completely fair for them to charge for this repair because the component is guaranteed to fail at some point, just like tires wear down, or the HV battery loses capacity. The issue is that their fix is to replace the entire MCU instead of just the failed component.

TeslaMotors,problem,rm4ncn,hpl5hsw,t3_rm4ncn,"I sent this over to Tesla as some of the key flaws for 10.5. Here is the full list:

* traveling through an intersection on yellow light, if the car sees red mid way it attempts to stop/slow down... pretty dangerous if someone behind will attempt to cross as well

* random slow downs, some can be attributed to limited visibility or cars that could be in cross traffic but many times there is no apparent reason for it. It's not really phantom breaking, more of a hesitation.

* correct lane selection during left turns or when proceeding through an intersection. At a certain intersection it gets into a right turning lane when it should proceed straight.

* abrupt swerving when going from one to two lanes. This one is pretty annoying. It seems it has trouble picking which lane to be in.. Just pick one. Seems to be better with cars around. <sounds like this might be better with 10.6>

* Yield sign behavior is inconsistent. Stops at a merge like intersection and goes full speed at a T like intersection both with yield signs.

* Crossing high speed roads and unprotected left turns are still just super scary at this point and mostly require a disengagement (60% of the time? in my area) especially with intersections that do not have a clear view. I think progress here requires better persistence of other agents over time and through occlusions, which I know is coming.

* Found one intersection (angled T) where a car stops on red but after a few seconds just starts rolling through it.

* Auto high beam... SUPER annoying in residential areas where they are not needed.

* Speed control needs to improve. I have it set to +3 over speed limit and that is fine for 45mph areas where everyone is going 50mph but residential 25mph often requires to proceed at ~20mph

* If a mistake is made the recovery should be more smooth, sometimes it gets into the wrong lane and corrects itself midway as if it's avoiding a collision, a smoother correction in some cases would be more natural and make others around freak out less.

* Route selection. Learn individual preference for a route. Currently navigating to certain destinations picks 2 routes at what seems to be random at different times for no apparent reason. No traffic, same time of day, same conditions etc. I prefer one over the other, let me default to it. This also applies to another route where it attempts to make a left at a super busy intersection, even as a human driver I prefer to take the very next street that has a light and is faster route most of the time. This would also greatly increase disengagement free drives, and be safer by avoiding a high risk intersection. I don't mind spending 30 more seconds if it's able to actually complete the full drive and do so safer.

* Turning signal behavior. Needs to come on earlier, especially on fast moving roads where it comes on after braking is well underway.",thisiswhatidonow,22749.0,0.9817,False,False,False,22749.0,2888,False

TeslaMotors,frustrating,ej17w3,fcv7w8n,t3_ej17w3,"Teslas transition into a fully app-forward service organization is a fascinating case study in building a lean customer success / service organization. 

Being on hold waiting for customer service is consistently ranked the worst/most frustrating customer:business interaction. At the same time, interrupting a technician while they are working on a technical task, even if the interruptions are brief, has a huge detrimental impact on their efficiency, and a proven increase in preventable errors. 

Employing non-technical support representatives to answer calls is the classic solution, but it is really hard to make a value case for these positions when everything they are able to provide can also be provided by a good automated system. talking in circles with a support representative who can't answer your question and doesn't have a technical resource to escalate to (all being busy doing the valuable work they are being paid for) is also extremely frustrating...

Tesla has built an alternative, much more efficient solution in their mobile app, queueing technician:customer interactions so that the technician can address them between technical tasks, doing away with the support representatives  all together, replacing them with more technicans.

A significant secondary benefit to this system is that by switching to a message system, the ""polite but insistent"" negotiation strategies commonly employed in phone customer service interactions don't work.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,m5lg56,gr0kcla,t3_m5lg56,"I enjoy road tripping in the M3 way more than my ICE vehicles but there’s a couple things I’ve noticed that make it easier:

-use A Better Route Planner instead of the the in car NAV to plan your trip with.  It will take you through superchargers that are the best, not what Tesla diverts you through because of how busy they are.  I live in Florida and go to NC a lot. Tesla always puts me through Atlanta and has me stopping right in downtown and an underground supercharger way off the road in a shitty part of town.  ABRP takes me through Athens instead of Atlanta and it’s right next to this awesome BBQ place 

-retrain your brain a little bit on what a road trip is.  What I mean is I wanted to get where I was going as fast as possible so I would drive longer stretches even though I was fatigued and only stop once every 4-5 hours to get gas and hurry back.  With the Tesla, you do stop more frequently but enjoy getting out and stretching your legs and just relax a little.  It adds an extra hour to hour and a half for every 10 hours I travel but I get to where I’m going more relaxed and less sore and I tend to find cool little towns or shops that I otherwise would have missed 

-supercharger costs are $15-20 every 600 miles or so that you drive. Cheaper than fuel but i feel good about spending that extra money on experience at a cool little coffee shop or local shop 

Point is, relax and enjoy the trip and if there’s supercharger stops that are terrible because there’s no amenities or they’re in a bad part of town, plan a different route before you go.  When you get the hang of it, it’s a much better way to travel.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,m5lg56,gr0lrnj,t3_m5lg56,"Single best thing Tesla can do to make their cars even more competitive is to add more superchargers.  OTOH, most of my trips go fine already.  I plan on having about 190 miles of usable range in my model 3 long range in winter conditions, but there are almost always superchargers along the way.  Generally, I try to arrive at a charger with under \~80 miles of range, and don't charge past 60%.  Your trip is much faster if you make more frequent stops to take advantage of the faster charge rates at the bottom.  Occasionally you might find yourself frustrated if you have to stop at a very busy supercharger and only get a low rate charge, but this has only happened a few times in two years of ownership.

Even on trips like Boston -> Montreal -> Boston, it hasn't been much of an inconvenience.  There are a few superchargers along the way with grocery stores so I just stop on the way there to buy any supplies I might need during the trip and by the time I get back to my car it's ready to roll, and then stop on the way home to pick up anything I might need back at home.  Often times I'll run inside at a rest stop to go to the bathroom and grab a snack, and by the time I get back to the car ten minutes later it's almost done charging already.  More than 50% of my miles so far have been long range trips for hiking, skiing, or visiting friends in other metros.

In general, I wouldn't let yourself be too paranoid to make it to the next charger.  If it's cold out (below 40), always assume you need 150% of the miles in rated range.  If your range is dropping too rapidly at the halfway point, you can just reduce your speed and still make it.  You'll get better and better at guessing how much range you need as you do these trips more often, to the point where you'll get pretty good at arriving at the next charger with 15-20 miles left.  Worst case, if you mis-judge severely you have a small amount of buffer even once you reach zero.  I've never needed to use that buffer, but I have had to reduce my speed by 10-15 mph a couple of times when I got too aggressive with my route planning.",ASYMT0TIC,37838.0,-0.5882,False,False,False,37838.0,2106,False

When you're in a dedicated turn lane, with a car coming towards you, yeah, I don't expect it to work to be honest, not reliably.  I largely blame it on the position of the forward facing cameras.  As a human I tend to sit left of center, so I get to see oncoming traffic a little easier, but the camera is dead center, so depending on what the size of the vehicle ahead of me is that is creating an obstacle, the car sometimes tries to turn left, when in reality it should just be chilling until visibility improves.

Live and learn and such I suppose.

[Tesla Gigafactory 3 video update: structure is growing at ~~dangerous~~ breakneck pace](https://electrek.co/2019/04/19/tesla-gigafactory-3-video-update/)

The title originally said ""dangerious"", was later edited to ""breakneck"" after lots of people commented on the wording.

[Tesla Model S caught on video bursting into flames seemingly on its own when parked](https://electrek.co/2019/04/21/tesla-bursting-into-flames-video/)

""seemingly on its own"" is totally unnecessary and adds subtext that ""Tesla's AI decided to set itself on fire"".

Fred then puts on his tinfoil hat and speculates arson.

He does mention EV fires are less likely than ICE. But he then posts a spreadsheet done by a choir teacher showing fires per vehicle.

The spreadsheet is OK 5-minute napkin math, but it's nowhere close to being accurate because it took all ICE vehicles, not just newer ones, which would have been a closer comparison to Tesla's fleet. Fred could have easily spent a few minutes refining this, or at least mentioning it, because someone had commented on it in the same reddit link he cited.

[EVs are blowing up on Turo, showing strong organic demand for electric cars](https://electrek.co/2019/04/22/evs-blowing-up-on-turo-organic-demand-electric-cars/)

While Tesla definitely has software QA, normal software release proceedure is exactly what Tesla is doing in terms of OTA. When you have the luxury of not having to push an update because of safety/vulnerability, you push your updates slowly to your fleet (whether it be cars in this case, or servers in the common case). This allows you to add another layer of risk management for QA - if there is an edge case bug with your software, it will hopefully get caught in your pre-production QA. But, the nature of the beast is that not all bugs will get caught. So by rolling out the update slowly, they can then catch some bugs in the first part of the fleet they roll out to. If they do, they pause the rest of the rollout and fix the bug. If nothing comes up, they roll out to another part of the fleet, and so on and so forth. Realistically they need some time for each part of the fleet to use the product and report back bugs. For some types of software products, this can be seconds, for others it can be days. For Tesla the timeframe would be closer to days, so it can add up to weeks for the entire fleet to work through.

Last month my Nissan Leaf was totaled. I loved the car, it was a 2015 SL with the around-view cameras (easily the best camera feature I have ever seen in a car). My plan was to keep it and get the model 3 in Dec (stood in line, east coast) and get that sweet tax incentive.
Now.. I don't have a car (well, I kinda do, but it's got 197,000 miles and way too many problems). So now I'm weighing my options:
1. Ford Focus Electric. 2017-2018 models have a 33.3 kWh battery now and has DC fast charging. Did the test drive and I'm liking it. All advertised sales on ford's site, unsurprisingly, becomes less sweet after you actually sit down with the dealership sales guys. I have found a 2017 model down to $23,000, and that remains a contender for me. Plus CarPlay is a huge plus and the car looks and feels like a regular car.
2. Used Fusion Energi or C-Max Energi. Really good prices and the Fusion has awesome features like adaptive cruise control, AC seats, lane departure warning, blind spot monitor, etc. But I'm right back to needing Oil changes and going to gas stations again. (My wife likes this option)
3. Try my luck with my dying car and see where it gets me. But I can't make trips to NY (from MD) with this car. I made a few trips with my Leaf and although the multiple stops take a lot of time, I still loved the experience.

The Model S rides much more comfortably and it perfect for cruising down the highway. The ride on the 3 is a little more sporty (harsh) with more road noise. I also really like the auto liftgate on the Model S. Model S is also much wider both for passengers in the rear and cargo in the trunk.

At first I was being very selective as to what accessories I needed, but the never ending YouTubers shilling the same useless shit kinda got to me.  

I'm not that bad though, so far I think almost all of my accessories are a smart buy.  I can only think of  1 useless accessory purchase and thats the cup holder.  The rest of it is mostly geared towards keeping the white interior as clean as possible with a young family.   


For the curious, my Must-Have accessories are:  

● Floorats including frunk and trunk + mats that cover the back seats when folded

● Mud flaps 

● Mesh under-seat vent covers 

● Screen protector 

● Hansshow power frunk

● Leather shield 

● Arm rest 

● Rubber lifting jack pads

● Tesla branded trash bag that hangs on the back of front seats 

● Baby mirror with suction cup to mount on roof glass

● Mr Clean magic eraser sheets

● Rear trunk side storage organizers 

● USB C magnetic charging cable 

● Quality 50 amp extension cord w/ Nema 14-50 

● Tesla Mobile connector 

● Tesla CCS adapter

What do?

Any human driver would simply drive around the stopped vehicle that's blocking the road. But this, and countless other similar problems (and many not so similar) are really difficult to formalize for a self driving system. 

Tesla hasn't even demonstrated FSD under easy conditions, let alone under hard conditions. Cruise, Waymo, MobilEye and others are miles ahead of Tesla in this tech.

I paid $3000 for FSD, it will either be FSD or I'll get my money back. Plain and simple.

If my car gets totalled then insurance will pay me for the FSD add-on, no biggie.

By pre-paying, I lock in my rate. There's no fear I'm going to have old sensors because I have whatever sensors the car comes with when I bought it. This will be the case if I prepay or not. Although, by prepaying, if there's something necessary then Tesla must retrofit at their expense or refund me the full amount.

They know.  The app is officially beta anyway.  It will get better, but that's also a compromise between letting your car sleep for battery purposes, and waking up quickly for app purposes.  If you have specific ideas you should email ownership with polite suggestions.

>The range needs to double if I'm going to use it as my main car

This just will not happen.  Nobody will make a 600 mile car, and if they do, nobody will buy a 600 mile car.  They're not going to make a car for people who drive 100k/yr because nobody does.  I know you just said you do, but you probably represent .01% or less of the populace.  As long as we are in the BEV paradigm, there will not be a 600 mile range car.  Manufacturers will focus on supercharging, not ever-increasing battery sizes.  Every automaker wants lighter and cheaper cars, and 600 mile cars will always be heavier and more expensive than 200 mile cars.

>When there's a problem things don't work like gps and Bluetooth, causing potential safety issues.

The point is that things on the center screen *don't* cause safety issues, because the car can still be operated just fine without gps and bluetooth, but not without power steering or brakes, which are controlled by a separate unit.  By the way, you can reset the middle screen by holding the buttons on the wheel for like 10 seconds.  I think its the mid-wheel buttons for the center screen, and the top buttons for the dash display.  Or vice versa, I forget.  You have to hold them longer than you'd think.

>It sucks knowing that in a short period of time the car will be significantly inferior to the next version.

Luckily there's updates available, and also note that so far, Tesla has only ever increased prices on their cars and options.  The early cars don't have some of the newer features, but many of them are retrofittable or software-updateable, and many of the features the early cars did have were either included, or cheaper options, or cheaper base price or something.  So far, there's very few customers who have felt left out of upgrades.  Also, this does happen with every car, but I find that Tesla is much more responsive to early customers than other companies are, because they know the worth of early customers.

>I'm tired of being an evangelist. You get a lot of questions with the car and I am tired of saying the same spiel over and over. I'm considering printing up a FAQ page to hand out.

Well, too bad, this is going to continue.  I'm 5 years in and it's basically all I ever talk about anymore.  You're stuck for life.  But yeah, print up a page, that'll help.  Maybe.  Probably not.

>I wish batteries were leased instead of owned so that battery swapping would be more feasible and I wouldn't have longevity anxiety.

Well longevity shouldn't be an issue for even people who drive a lot....but you drive a ridiculous amount.  However, you should check out the results of Plug-In America's Roadster Battery Survey here: http://www.pluginamerica.org/surveys/batteries/tesla-roadster/PIA-Roadster-Battery-Study.pdf  Basically, Roadster batteries are lasting longer than anyone thought.  Also, there's a couple people with over 200k miles on Roadsters who are still getting 80% or something of their original capacity.  But with your driving, if it all goes on the S, you'll probably run out of capacity before there are enough battery improvements to make a replacement economical.  But really, 100k/yr is ridiculous :-P

Anyway, there's a few reasons for no battery lease: 1) it confuses consumers.  2) One major reason that Tesla likes to sell rather than lease components is because of the EV1.  The EV1 was lease-only, and when GM decided they were done with it, they took all the cars back and destroyed them.  The Roadster was meant to be a response to this, and that's why it was purchasable without a lease, so people knew that Tesla would not, and could not, do that.  So that's one motivation behind it.  But I think the main reason is just because it's complicated and confusing to people.  The idea really hasn't taken off anywhere, Renault tried it in Europe with the Zoe/Twizy (I think?), and as far as I know people aren't super thrilled about it.

>Climate should be on a schedule

I think they talked about this being planned at some point.  Easy to add as a software update.  Try emailing ownership, they do listen to owner concerns, and if they hear about something often enough, they'll get around to it eventually.

>·Cruise control should show what exactly it's set at and the 'jump' feature should settle on the 0/5 like on the Mercedes where Tesla gets its cruise system from. It should also be adaptive.

They won't be able to software update your car to be adaptive, but that will eventually come, it's a hardware thing though of course.  Probably it will be retrofittable, but will also probably be cost-prohibitive to do so (parking sensors for example, I think they can be retrofit but its like 4 grand or something).  I have no doubt that adaptive cruise will come, and probably as part of the next significant car update (maybe when X debuts), that's my feeling anyway.

>·The latency in the Bluetooth is unacceptable and unfortunately I doubt it's a software problem. I've never had this issue with other cars and I've noticed it on every Model S. It also is unable to see what I'm playing, it just says the name of my phone. The standard KIA headunit on the rental car I currently have shows artist, song title, etc. The other annoyance with Bluetooth is that I have to manually select it every time I get in the car, it should remember what I was last on.

What phone do you have?  It does work better with some phones than others, I think.  I think it gets album art and such from iPhones...I know I've seen it have some problems with older androids...

edit: nevermind I see you answered the phone thing elsewhere.  Maybe update the software on your phone, or maybe your phone doesn't have bluetooth control turned on or something?  I think there might be some phone settings, on some phone softwares, which allow more or less control via bluetooth.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,f0rl05,fgx8l1o,t3_f0rl05,"Not saying these aren't valid points but counter-perspective: they have other equally or more pressing priorities for the teams tasked with those functions. 

In software engineering, it doesn't quite scale linearly with more added software engineers, because that adds complexity to design and implementation (think too many cooks in the kitchen). So most companies divide their software engineers into smaller teams focused on specific features or products. 

In Tesla's case, the team in charge of the games aren't the same as the team in charge of the HVAC or the Autopilot system. Adding more software engineers to the HVAC team doesn't necessarily mean faster schedule to feature or patch releases, in fact many research suggest a potentially negative correlation. 

Lastly, integration. For example, if HVAC team changes something with their UI, they need to make sure what they do doesn't affect another team's functionality, like the music team's. This takes time to make sure it's done correctly and doesn't break additional things. 

Tesla's software development practice is like those of many SF area companies, they release minimally viable products first, then collect feedback and iterate on those to gradually improve the experience. This precisely addresses the problem you face where maybe auto highbeam isn't great in your geography, they can collect data on that and improve it over time rather than not having it at all for folks in geographies where it works really well.

I'm sure Tesla engineers lurk in this sub; however, I do recommend copying your text and sending it directly to feedback@tesla.com where they may document it in their internal issue tracking system. Product managers and engineers rely on those issue tracking systems to prioritize efforts.

I came from a 2013 Leaf that I bought used. I had it for about 2 years before buying my Model 3.

I could have written this.

Half the time I'm not sure if my Model 3 is amazing or if it's just the fact that it's a new car and I've never bought a new car, but when I compare it to other cars (and even other EVs) it is so refreshingly different. I think Sandy Munro said something about how the Model 3 will be bought by ""millennials"" (get off my lawn) who've never bought a new car before and won't care about things like panel gaps. When I told my wife about panel gaps she was like ""who cares?!""

People may think I'm inexperienced or naive, but Tesla made a product that me and others like me want, so \*shrug\*. The reality is that Tesla may not be good a gearhead stuff like panel gaps, but where it matters (OTA updates, electric motors and batteries, AI) they blow away the traditional automakers (and Munro eventually came around to this). Most automakers are creating their own Tesla killers, but they won't manufacture them until 2023. By then Tesla will be 3 steps ahead.

1) every phone or tablet I’ve tested can get the Bluetooth stack ‘stuck’. 
2) Use it as a dev device for 4 hours and at some point I’ll have to turn Bluetooth off/on or restart the phone
3) android tablets are the worst
4) android phones are worse than iPhones, most likely due to fragmentation and old versions (5/6 are not so reliable)
5) on android your app can turn Bluetooth off and back on programmatically, but doing this is a big battery drain. I’ve only ever done it with apps in the foreground 
7) other apps can interfere with your app. Especially if you’re trying to do background discovery and reconnect. The Bluetooth hardware has limited filtering slots. Many apps use Bluetooth beacons to track you even when they run in the background.
8) Bluetooth can suffer badly from interference just like old 2.4 wifi. Think: microwaves, too many other devices broadcasting or using the shared channels

A) disable Bluetooth on every other app on your phone (location permission also works)
B) check how many other BT devices are visible. Are they yours? Can you turn them off for a week or two? 
C) focus on a single location like your driveway. See if you can get it working reliably there first.
D) use a wifi sniffer to see what 2.4G bands are near your car/phone",markopolo82,7803.0,-0.7998,False,False,False,7803.0,1458,False

1. Ordered the hub, wireless charger, and spacer bundle for my Model 3.- Hub was backordered and didn't come until a month or so later. That was expected, but the wireless pad and spacer didn't come with it...- Contacted them through email, never got a response- Sent them a DM on Twitter and they said somehow the shipping had been cancelled- Said they'd send out the wireless pad but that the spacer was out of stock and would be shipped out when they were back in stock.
2. 9 months later or so, not learning from my mistake, I ordered the hub/charger bundle for my Model Y.- Find out there's currently no actual expected shipping date for the Y hub, and I essentially bought vaporware- DMed them on Twitter again to ask if they can ship out just the wireless pad and the spacer they still owed me that never actually got shipped out - they say sure, they'll get sent out this week.- A week passes and I ask again if they're going to send out the items they owe me. I ask again and they say they'll ship them out that day. Surprise surprise, it doesn't.- I DM them again to cancel my order entirely, and they say ""Are you sure? We can get the wireless pad and spacer shipped out today."" I say okay but this is your last chance and then I'm done.- After nearly two months, I finally have my wireless pad and the spacer I bought *almost a year ago.* Still no word on when the Model Y hub will be available.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,8hb3wd,dyixjj1,t3_8hb3wd,"So at least in the Netherlands Tesla relay (not replay) attacks are pretty common. We were also the first country to receive the update that automatically disabled passive entry for us. I believe there are other countries that have also received it now.

Several Teslas have been stolen simply by listening for key fobs near the front door of your house, capturing the signal (no presses needed) and relaying it to a device near the car. The car thinks the fob is nearby and opens the car and you can drive off. More info and a video of actual security footage here https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/key-fob-relay-thefts-should-we-be-concerned.103017/

To prevent this I recommend turning passive entry off. The downside is this always requires you to use the fob to unlock your car using two presses on the unlock button.

Another solution has been mentioned in this thread, where you can enable Valet mode every time you park. This then requires a pin to disable and I believe it also prevents the disabling of mobile access from the settings. Of course this is pretty cumbersome, but I'd like to add this to my app (currently beta testing) if there are enough people interested.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,dhjw62,f3opocu,t3_dhjw62,"I have an idea or two:

**1.) SentryMode Improvements:**

A. Ability to alert you if something actually made contact with your car as oppose to something just getting close to your car (this would help weed out most videos).

B. Ability to view SentryMode video on screen with helpful tools to quickly sift through video and archive unimportant videos.

C. When SentryMode is triggered, send a few images or short GIF of footage to your phone.

D. Share a screenshot or short video clip to your phone.

E. Access to all 9 camera angles.

F. Ideally implement some neural networks to auto-archive footage that is not important and auto-flag videos that seem more important.

G. Access to that SentryMode footage which Tesla claims is stored in the cloud for 72 hours.

H. Access to live video feed from your phone (unlikely).  

**2.) Add multiple waypoints in nav,** like Google Maps.

**3.) Schedule END time for charging,** e.g., I want to reach 100% charge at 8 AM. Also, option to automatically charge when energy prices are cheapest and ability to schedule charging days in advance, or on a weekly schedule (like [TeslaFi](https://www.teslafi.com)).

**4.) Ability to minimize video, games, etc** so that you can adjust climate, heated seats, etc, then continue watching video, playing game, etc. without having to restart it.

**5.) Ability to rearrange icons** on the the apps drawer (""^"") as well as the 3 icons under car on the left side of the screen. Ability to add your own custom shortcuts to your favorite settings. While watching videos, you already have access to temp control, but it would be nice to be able to go change any setting and come back to your video without having to restart the app.

**6.) Voice control for everything.** e.g., open glove box, open frunk, set temperature to 69 degrees, etc.

**7.) Add voice control back for playing music!** I still can't believe we lost this ability with V10.

**8.) Add ALL Spotify functionalities.** Anything I can do on the Spotify app on my phone or on their website, I should be able to do in the car.

**9.) Button to open glovebox** on main screen for easy access.

**10.) Make auto-wipers stop wiping for no reason in my garage.**

**11.) WiFi hotspot** from car.

**12.) Add more driving ""styles""** for Navigate on Autopilot, specifically one that drives as efficiency as possible for the speed you have set: slow down more gradually (if safe), speed up more gradually, try to maintain constant speed, etc.

**13.) Super accurate range estimates** that take into account the weather along your route, wind speed and direction, elevation changes, cargo weight (if that's possible), climate control and other cabin energy draw, as well as personal driving style based on history. Give user ability to plan a route ahead of time (like [abetterrouteplanner.com](https://www.abetterrouteplanner.com), and ability to play with these variables to help plan charging stops.

**14.) Give access to all 9 cameras** while driving, not just the rear camera. A stitched 180° or 360° view would be cool. Access to interior camera to keep an eye on kids in the back, for example.

**15.) When blinker is on, show camera** from that side of the car! This is standard on so many cars these days. I really want this one.

**16.) More detail about error messages.** For example, for ""Navigate on Autopilot Limited"" error, tell me which camera/sensor is having trouble and show me the video feed. For ""Unable to charge, check power source"" error, tell me what the problem is. No grounding? Too much resistance? Too much voltage drop? Too much variability in frequency? Etc.

**17.) Link Spotify to driver profile.**

**18.) Password manager** (Spotify, web browser, Netflix, etc). Therefore, password (PIN) and/or phone-present protected driver profiles.

**19.) Provide more detailed bug reports**

**20.) Provide feature requests** (like this one)",brandude87,31783.0,0.9936,False,False,False,31783.0,3905,False

Day 1 Online res holder as well, ordered my car on June 26th and was told a week or so later that my car would be at the Westmont Chicago delivery center for pickup on Saturday July 14th. The day before, I got a phone call from the delivery specialist telling me that the car wasn't there yet and rescheduled me for the next Wednesday (July 18th). On the 14th, 2hrs before I would've had to leave to drive 2hrs to Westmont, he called me again and said the car still wasn't there and they didn't know when it would be there, so they weren't going to reschedule me until they had more info.  2 days later the ISA told me they had more info and could reschedule me for the next Tuesday (the 24th). By then, I had trust issues, so I called on Monday to make sure the car was there... And what do you know, it wasn't. 

Meanwhile, I have a trade-in that developed some issues (thanks Murphy's law) since I ordered, so I asked if there was a way to get me out of the trade-in now and get me a rental or loaner until the Model 3 showed up, and the ISA said she could make that happen, so I drove to Chicago on Tuesday to do a ""pre-trade"" and get a car that didn't have front suspension issues. Once I was there, they signed off the trade-in paperwork, and after an hour, told me they couldn't give me a rental or loaner (I'm 22, might be why) so I'd have to take my (problematic) car back home until the Model 3 came in. Broken promise, ridiculous... But back to the story.

They rescheduled me for yesterday (July 28th) and the car finally came in on Thursday (July 26th), so I pushed the delivery up to Friday night (July 27th). The delivery specialist called me Friday morning to say that the detailers had buffed the car too hard the night before, and the paint was ruined, with a 4wk body shop estimate, so they're reassigning me to another VIN and don't know how long it will be. He apologized and said he'd try to get me a loaner or rental, but called back that evening to say that they couldn't do that and he didn't have anything else for me.

Your car is not really bricked if the problem is your 12v battery. [You can jump the car](https://imgur.com/a/vk72tvh) to energize the car's 12v system. There are also plenty of videos on-line you can follow. If your 12v battery can accept a charge, this might fix your issue as the high-voltage battery should start charging it. But obviously if your 12v died, there's a good chance there's some issue with it (or maybe the parts that are used to charge it).

>whats frustrating is that the 12v battery stops working after a year most cars it lasts 2-3 years not 1 to 1 and half

That's not supposed to happen though. The 12v battery should last many years, just like a normal car. Your Tesla should also warn you when it detects your battery is getting towards it's end of life so you can replace it long before it dies. Obvioulsy, that did not happen in your case. That means something did not work right. It could be that you just happened to get a bad battery or maybe there's some other problem with your car. But it's not the norm.

>since I live about 300 miles from a service center they need mobile service to come but they have to ship the battery by fedex ground so its gonna take a while ill be without a car for 5 days

FYI, if you're a handy person, you can [change the 12v yourself.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ApCicyLGioE) It's not the easiest, but it might beat waiting 5-days. I believe it uses a [DCS-33IT battery](https://teslatap.com/articles/12-volt-battery-compendium/)

>they should really but n a fail safe or a backup system to the 12v battery cause right now not even the alarm will sound and I cant get it onto a flat bed, it should be able to utilize power from the main battery when the 12v knocks out

The 12v is charged from the high-voltage battery whenever it gets low. However, the 12v is needed to physically connect the high-voltage battery. (the high-voltage battery is usually physically disconnected when the car is off, for safety).

It seems like different service centers, and even different service advisors within a service center, have vastly different levels of customer service. They seem to operate almost independently from the mothership, and certainly view themselves as separate from Tesla corporate. I've heard people have great experiences at some of the SvCs. My own experiences have ranged from ""meh"" to ""that guy is just treated me like dirt"".

Also, the information sharing between the central telephone support line and the service centers is a joke. Routinely the telephone support files a ticket for the SvC to follow up with me, and never once has anybody from the SvC followed up on a ticket. When I finally call them for a status, they have no idea they were even supposed to be looking into something for me -- absolutely no record of it. Their ticketing system is a black hole from which tickets never return.

All of this is going to get way, way worse with the huge increase in production volumes and, therefore, demands on the service centers. They are totally not ready for it. Mine seems to be barely holding it together as it is.

Tesla is a car and a car company built from first principles. It questioned everything, and became a leader that the rest of the industry is scrambling to emulate. They said, we need electric cars. So let's build them. But electric cars need to charge and charging doesn't exist. So let's build that too. And if we really want to walk the walk and build millions of these things there just aren't enough batteries. So let's double the world's production ourselves. And who needs dealers? People don't like them. Let's change that whole experience. And while we're at it we'll make our cars look better and safer and faster and we'll keep giving owners new features via technology. Tesla has single-handedly lit a fire under the rest of the global car industry, and changed the whole idea of what a car should be. As a result, Tesla is the most authentic voice in sustainable transport.

GM had their chance to lead. The produced a car that people loved, the EV1. If they stuck to that program, Tesla as a company may have never been necessary today. But instead of embracing a technology that would have made the world better faster, they fought long and hard to defeat the regulations that necessitated the development of that vehicle. And then when they won, the gathered all of them up, crushed them, and swept them under the rug. They went back to selling Hummers and Escalades. Meanwhile, they ignored deadly defects in their cars for years. They took bailout money. They made motions that they would innovate once more with the Volt, but have watched it languish on the market due to insufficient training and directive to an uninterested dealer network. 

And so when Tesla announces a car that makes the Bolt feel irrelevant, I can't help but feel a sense of victory despite the fact that I'm rooting for as many EVs as possible, am cheering on the companies that I feel ""get it"" (BMW and Nissan, for instance, due to impressive 1st-gen vehicles, long term vision, investment in infrastructure and innovation in materials and manufacturing). 

We need companies like Tesla, who have a mission and put their money where their mouth is (by burning immense cash in the short term to lay the long term groundwork of manufacturing and infrastructure). These companies keep the others honest and innovating. They carry us forward. And without them, we've already seen that companies like GM are willing to sweep the whole thing under the rug and hope everyone forgets about it.

That's why, sometimes, I bash the Bolt. ",NikonD3s,11758.0,0.9887,False,False,False,11758.0,2614,False

Personally, I think that the Bolt is a monumental step for GM, but it's also the reason that, without Tesla, electric cars would never be mainstream. Look at it. When you think of an electric car, the Bolt, the Leaf, the i3 are all what come to mind. Tesla will come out ahead by leaps and bounds for the simple fact that they make cars people would want to drive even if they weren't electric.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,4f1j5g,d25anne,t3_4f1j5g,"1: GM is actively fighting Tesla's direct sales model, even beyond the car dealerships. Their lawyers have been active in a number of states trying to block Tesla. Look at the video of the GM lawyers testifying in Maryland with their specious arguments.

2: Non-Tesla EVs are often held up as reasons why Tesla will die. I think most people are open to seeing what the Bolt is in reality, but there are a lot of people championing the Bolt as the Tesla killer. Therefore, drawing the very real distinction between what GM is doing with the Volt/Bolt versus what Tesla is trying to accomplish with the Model 3 is very important. GM's future is not necessarily tied to the Bolt. Tesla is 150% behind the Model 3 and moving us towards sustainable transport. Every other automaker, not so much.

3: GM cannot be trusted with leading electrification... matter of fact, no company outside of Tesla thus far can be trusted to be in the forefront of this movement, much less spearhead it. You can see it in the lackluster products and piss poor infrastructure investments that the other automakers have pushed so far. They are still protecting their ICE vehicles from BEV competition. They are not investing in the technology, the production capacity, nor the infrastructure at a high level. Instead, they make a few of these EVs to mostly satisfy regulators like CARB and the EU. They think they are building some funky products to pursue a small eco-wacky Prius segment. Think of why the Bolt or the Volt even exist as separate products - why is the Bolt, which is basically a Buick Encore or Chevy Trax, not actually the Buick Encore or the Chevy Trax? Why is the i3 the i3 and not the current BMW 3 series? Why the separate branding at all? The answer is that they are not whole heartedly behind leading sustainable transport. The Leaf shipped a while ago... and yet no Infiniti BEV, the Maxima is not a BEV or even a PHEV.

4: GM has let people go to jail when they knew that their ignition switches had a high likelihood of being the culprit in a number of accidents. They continue to shirk their responsibilities in this matter. Yes, GM will kill you over < $5. GM is still run by the same people, even though GM is one of our youngest car companies. You can't claim GM's legacy without taking all the bad parts too.

5: The plight of a company's workers is the worst reason to buy a product. That's crony capitalism in another guise. If a company's products and ethos are not in a good place, then they deserve to suffer in the marketplace. Ultimately it keeps them healthier. If we buy products and services based on non-competitive factors, those companies do not get the right feedback and make the right adjustments along the way. That can result in big disruptions. Witness what happened to the auto industry when the Japanese came into the market with superior products and services. You can only play the loyalty game for so long and it is clear that consumers are more than willing to shift brand loyalties very quickly.

6: The Bolt is clearly a compliance play for CARB ZEV type III credits. They are not solving all the chicken and egg problems associated with a dramatic technology shift. They are not investing half a billion dollars into a real 350+ amp L3 charging network yet. The Bolt has terrible aerodynamics and clearly will struggle getting even close to 200 miles of range at real highway speeds. They are not dropping $10 billion dollars into building lithium ion battery production plants yet. That results in lackluster production numbers for a major automaker and so they clearly are half hearted in this effort..",tech01x,63544.0,-0.8776,False,False,False,63544.0,3639,False

IMO:
The companies (e.g. GM) that make those cars are actively trying to undermine the public's progress toward sustainable energy. Any ""green cars"" they make are made solely to satisfy some government regulation or incentive (which they actively seek to destroy). The green cars they DO make are terrible for no good reason. Tesla has opened all it's patents for other companies to use for free. Instead of following Tesla's lead, they choose to make cars ""their"" way, which is obviously less efficient. An example is that Tesla packs the batteries and drive unit in the floor and keeps everything down low to lower the center of gravity - giving more stability (safety) and room in the car. Ford, knowing this, and knowing that Tesla's patents are available to use for free, says fuck that, let's stack the battery in the trunk area, so it takes up space and makes the car less stable. Another example: Chevy says, oh Tesla's frontal impact crumble zone allows for much lower probability of injury? Fuck that, Let's stack everything in the front where the engine would be, giving the driver less space and making them less safe. Nissan says: Oh you want to drive an electric car? We have to make it look stupid because aerodynamics. Tesla can make their cars look good while having better aerodynamics, but we choose to make this look polarizing. You're a ""greenie""? Here, a part of your instrument panel will be a tree that you can grow. You can't turn that off. 

>I can think of plenty of reasons someone might choose it [bolt] over the Tesla.

The only reason I could think of is if they didn't want to wait for a car that is outstandingly better in every category (the most important being safety).

TeslaMotors,frustrating,6trv62,dln4v90,t3_6trv62,"Sounds similar to my experience when my wife and I bought her outback. A few things I learned.

1) don't be afraid to walk out at any point. You should have all the power in the negotiation. If they won't deal with you semi-reasonably, don't deal.

2) Do walk out. I did this after they gave me an offer I could accept. Wife and I walked out, took a walk around the block, talked about it, but mainly to just calm down and make sure we were accepting on our terms.

3) if possible, take a friend. Preferably someone who has gone through it and knows what's coming.

4) beware the financial officer. He/she is who you talk to after shaking hands on the deal with your salesman. The finance office is where the dealership will try to make a few grand selling you service packages, protection plans, and extended warranties. My opinion, if the car is as good as they say, why do I need this stuff? Also, a lot of the stuff in the protection plan is usually covered by insurance anyway.

5) know what the dealer is actually paying for the car. Usually they get rebates and incentives from the manufacturer making their cost $1+k below invoice. Sites like TrueCar and others can let you know. Edit: this is to know what offer they can accept. If car is in high demand, expect to pay MSRP. If they want to clear then from the lot, they will be willing to sell it at or near cost.

I understand what you are trying to do by buying this to hold you over until you are in a better position to get something better.  The problem is you are likely setting yourself up to a take a much bigger loss than you can anticipate.  Especially if you plan on having this vehicle for only a few years, you should consider a used vehicle or a lease that way you know your fixed cost.  New vehicles take such a big hit in value after first purchased, and cars similar to the Bolt in the past have been notorious for taking the biggest hit especially after 2 years of ownership.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,6trv62,dlnl6kc,t3_6trv62,"So I've had crappy experiences with both CES's and OA's. They were different types of crappy experiences with each though. The CES's tend to ignore me and don't talk to me unless I ask them a question directly and will try to excuse themselves when they see a male who looks older than me looking at a car (I'm female). I hate interacting with them!

The OA's have been a mixed bag. Most have been nice and helpful and, but others have given me a slimy salesman pressure feel. For example, I went in last week to the showroom wanting to see the colors on an actual car in the sun. I also wanted to see what level AP2 has gotten to and hopefully do a test drive. I got a female OA and told her I was one of the ones trying to decide between a 3 & S and was waiting to see a 3 in person first, but had questions about the S and wanted to test drive it (it'd been 5 months since my last test drive). The whole time she kept trying to get me to get an inventory car. It was a lot of pressure from her to just get it now. When it was obvious I wasn't going to do that and wanted a test drive, it basically all ended and she took my info to call me to set up a test drive. I left feeling all icky like I do when leaving a dealership. I got the vibe that she thought I was wasting her time and was trying to get me to leave. 

I did set up a test drive for 2 days ago. Got to the showroom and signed in. The guy I talked to on the phone to make the appointment told me that he was working with another family and someone else would be able to help me. Guess who showed up? The same girl I dealt with the weekend before! I said to her ""Nope! I won't deal with you. You made me feel like I was wasting your time. I'll wait for Billy."" I waited and glad I did! I had the best experience with him that I've ever had at a Tesla showroom. Treated me amazing and gave me more information than anyone at Tesla ever has. He was exactly the OA I've been wanting to deal with. He's worked for Tesla for 5 years and personally owns an S. You could tell he was passionate about the company and when he saw how much I already knew (I'm a fan girl), he didn't treat me like a Tesla newbie. Before we took the test drive he said ""I'll just treat you like a Tesla employee."" He also didn't try to anti-sell the 3 and gave me his opinions of what the difference owning a 3 vs S would be like in the real world since he's seen and experienced the 3 in CA. He talked very positively about the 3. He also let me grill him on what it's like owning an S in DC (where I live) and if AWD is really necessary. I was so impressed with him and thankful for his help, I emailed him a thank you note and know exactly who I will be dealing with from now on. I'll also make sure to work with him when I finally order my S or 3 later this year. I wish all Tesla OA's and CES's were that helpful and nice.

Figure out what type of car you want.  Contact a half dozen dealers and ask for their ""best price,"" by phone/email.  Feel free to test drive to show them you're serious.  Tell them you'll buy at the end of today.   Then in the afternoon call all the ""losers"" and let them know you'll be buying from dealer A.  Email them the price quote.   Some will counter offer with a better price.  Call dealer A and tell them, ""Sorry, I was going to drive over and buy, but dealer B offered me a better price.""  They may counter offer, ask for $1k under the other offer (show them each other's offers).  Rinse n repeat until there's only one left.  I was $5k under my target price.

So I would say, be prepared mentally to cancel if all goes south and then play it rough. Do not accept extra delivery charges not agreed upon early on.

 I test drove the Model 3 performance and bought one a day or two after... I also have a Porsche 911 (997) C2S and prior to that, a 2011 BMW335is with DCT. (Before that a BMW 330i, 323i, 328es, Volvo 242)

The Fiat is arguably more fun to drive than my 911. I like its immediate torque, its silence and styling. I hate squealing the Fiat's tires all the time, its shitty stock stereo/radio and TomTom sucks.

But the amount I was paying monthly in gas for the 911 was enough to offset the monthly payment for the 500e. So I'm trading in the 911 for the Model 3 Performance.

Firstly, while the Tesla is heavy, it never felt heavy. The suspension is so adept that it made my Fiat 500e seem heavy since the suspension is so spongy.

The interior design of the 3 is minimal and stark and just the way I like it. As for size, it's roughly the size of my old 3 series so it's something I've very familiar with. 

Look at a BMW 3 series or Mercedes C class and let me know which one has less room. You crazy thinking the Model 3 is small inside. OP, you have a Fiat500e, have you been in the back seat of that thing?

As for the charging, you would have already solved that with at-home charging and while I can't speak for supercharging in LA, it wouldn't be an issue if you had a home charger.

I didn't notice the turning radius of the Tesla 3, but it wasn't so bad to be noticeable. I was easily able to navigate the very tight parking garage we were in.

As for your comments on the UI and maps, well that's just laughable. There may be rough spots, but tell me where are the games for our 500e? Remember snake on the Nokia phones?

Where's the Fiat500e remote connection? Oh yeah, three years and they killed the mobile app and updates. (so pissed about that).

We've seen how the UI and functionality can change and improve over time. I expect we will continue to see improvements in the game ports, and mapping functions.

I only did 3 full walk-throughs, two model 3's and a model S (P100D so I knew it well). But I had many conversations with buyers. Hopefully I helped.

One thing I noticed is that people do read this forum. Sometimes they don't get the right answers, but they are reading r/teslamotors. 

One couple were very closely examining every gap and alignment. I asked what they drove and they said a BMW. I asked if the BMW was perfectly aligned and gapped. They did not know - ""We never looked, but after reading the forums we will inspect the Tesla closely"". That was the model S and it was perfect so no problems other than 30 minutes of inspecting every panel.

Another couple mentioned Tesla cars would probably be cheaper if they waited until Tesla went bankrupt, but were buying today to get free Supercharging. I left that statement alone.

One woman was aimlessly watching Youtube videos and we started talking... it was 6pm and she had been there for her 1pm pickup. We were there for our 5pm appointment.

One of the things that was working against the local dealer is they seem to be moving out all the Model 3s here to Florida. When we were actually shopping two nights prior, all of sudden the showrooms in Chicago had all gotten orders to put their model 3s on trucks and they were being sent to Florida. We had 7 minutes of test driving for our booked appointment because the car we were being shown was being put on a truck, and the guy who wanted it on the truck didn't even want us driving it. 

We committed to a car Wednesday night. Thursday it was relocated to our dealer and detailed (it was a demo car). Last night was our 5pm pickup, and at 6pm or so we were told our actual car had gotten swapped with another car VIN. At that point, our car had then been sold to another person, but it was still on their lot so they were ""fixing"" it back to being ours.

The AutoSteer (AS) veering out of lane one though, is strange to me.

Also, Model S certainly have rear cupholders, they’re just hidden and pop out from the center console underneath the AC vents (unless you have a pretty old one).

Charging takes longer than gas, no doubt about that. But when you’re driving 600 miles in a day, a 30 minute stop is pretty welcomed. Keep in mind that when you pump gas, you fiddle with the pump payment, stand there pumping, then run inside and use the restroom or grab a snack, maybe you check your inbox for 5 minutes before you’re back on the road. This can easily turn into 20 minutes, especially in these long trips. When charging, you plug in. That’s it. You can do everything else while the car is charging. Still takes a little longer, but it doesn’t *feel* like much longer.

But again, you need to make sure there are chargers where you need them.

Ideally there are multiple charging stops because honestly it’ll be faster to stop twice and charge 50% each time than it would be to stop once and charge 100%. That last 20% of battery takes as long or longer than that first 80%. Anyway the car figures this out for you and calculates all of it automatically. I drove from MA to NC recently, all in a single day. Stopped to charge 5 times with an average charge time of 17 minutes. It was a breeze, and did not feel like a chore. But also I was traveling a well covered route.

Also keep in mind that depending on your habits, you may spend less time fueling with the Tesla. Assuming you can charge at home, you leave every morning with a full battery. If you drive less than ~250 miles on most days, you will never stop to charge. It’s only the long distance trips. Meanwhile in a gas car, you’ll be stopping for gas 1-2x per week, every week. So while you might spend 30% more time fueling on infrequent long trips, you’re spending 100% less time stopping for fuel the rest of the time. I have a Tesla and a Jeep and after a while, getting gas is what feels like the chore. Leaving in the morning and realizing you need gas is incredibly annoying, because it literally never happens in the Tesla.

Use a website like http://www.abetterrouteplanner.com and route your 600mi journey there. The charging stops are optimized to ""get you there"", so you won't charge from 23% to 100%, you'll charge to maybe 82% or maybe even 63%, which takes less time. However, unless there are a number of environmental and landscape concerns (windy, mountain roads, etc), I seriously doubt the 50% overage on travel time. Using Superchargers the majority of the way works better than Level 2 chargers along the way.

>This in addition to the anxiety of using any additional power in the car for luxuries like AC / music and the fear of running out of charge or cutting close to dead batteries is very taxing per his experience.

I've driven 25k miles in my Tesla Model X, and put on 35k miles on my last car before swapping. The ""range anxiety"" is easily solved by just getting the larger battery (which is no longer an issue, they're all either Long Range or Performance), and with a bit of planning, a road trip isn't ""longer"" in the bad sense. In my experience, autopilot/FSD makes the journey more relaxing, and the stops are less ""HURRY UP COME ON WE GOTTA GAS AND GO"". When you know you'll be somewhere to charge for 30 minutes, you grab a bite, stretch your legs, play with the family, etc. I find there's a serenity to driving a Tesla on a road trip that doesn't exist with other cars, and I might be driving from LA to Ohio in a few months. I'm planning on doing it solo. 

Also, the car is literally a MASSIVE BATTERY. I have 2 Powerwalls in my house, which I can run my house for 6+ hours (probably double that, but I'm being conservative), and my car's battery is literally 4 times larger. Running the AC at full blast, charging 5+ phones, or even running a laptop will barely make a dent in the battery percentage or range. 

>This got me to re-think and looking for your suggestions, what is the reality of owning a Tesla? 

I never had a dream car, but apparently, I do, and it's my Tesla. 

>What kind of frustrations or anxieties do you face when on a road trip? 

Once you accept the obvious differences between an ICE car and an EV, in that re-fueling takes minutes with an ICE car and a lot longer with an EV, you plan your trip differently. A 3 hour drive to Las Vegas becomes a 3hr 45 minute drive, and the 45 minutes gets planned for a lunch stop. With a bit of planning, you can quickly embrace the EV driving experience; instead of ""filling up the tank"", you charge enough to get you there with some reserve. However, given how well the autopilot/FSD works on the highway, it's some of the most care free, relaxing driving you'll ever do. 

>How much extra time is added to your trip due to charging?

I think what really happened is they projected vision only would be ready by late April/May and built cars with the intention of rolling them out vision only.

If they had done this as a short sighted move to get more cars into the hands of people for Q2 results because they didn't have one part it's down right dangerous.

Tesla reached that conclusion by subjectively interpreting NHTSA's (which is less stringent than both IIHS and EuroCAP) data, and their methodology to reach that conclusion was rebuffed by none other than NHTSA itself. No doubt Model 3s are very safe cars, but so far there are no objective proof stating they are significantly safer than other cars in the same class.

The USB cable cannot be used, unless the phone is operating in ‘disk mode’.  You are required to use Bluetooth, and due to AAC support but not AptX, iPhone will sound better than Android.  Without Apple CarPlay or Android Play support, control integration with your phone is minimal.

I also tried using music on a low-profile USB stick.  While better than nothing or local radio on roads with no good cell coverage, there is no playlist support.

Slacker is plain terrible with regards to their shallow music library (due to poor agreements) and lack of Shazam integration to assist in creating playlists.  I also have a Peloton Cycle for fitness, and the instructors post their playlists onto Spotify (useful as I often hear new tunes first while working out).  If you go the Slacker Pro route you end up with double-duty playlist maintenance on Slacker for your car, and whatever other music service you use

I remember a post a while back about the camera starting to learn what people are doing, ""eyes on road"" or something else.

Your car may have had FSD, but that is a very misleading name (right now). Unless you have the FSD Beta, then your car can't steer on city streets. Navigate on Autopilot (NoA) is used on the highway to take you from entrance ramp to exit ramp. It should also handle any interstate changes automatically.

I have your exact same frustrations with how the car handles curves. I wish it wouldn't veer so far to one side of the lane. Because that can freak others and you out by getting uncomfortably close to other cars. Software updates will likely fix this in the future, but no telling when that would be.

Charging is something that you would need to get used to. Use the giant touch screen to find the official Tesla Superchargers. This is probably the most understated feature of owning a Tesla. And if you are on a trip, it automatically routes you to each charger that you need to stop at and even tells you how long you need to stay there.

Since it sounds like you really want one, you can always buy one without FSD now. Then you can add FSD on as a subscription or full price purchase after buying the car. FSD isn't ready yet. Even the Beta isn't perfect. It gets better over time though.

As far as the torque sensor on the wheel goes, what I do is keep one hand on the wheel off center - which creates enough torque to let the car know you have a hand on the wheel, but not disengage Autosteer.  If you do like the screen says, with both hands on the wheel, the net torque balances, and it can't detect your hand.  Based on firmware analysis and Teslas own announcements, they will enable the in cabin camera to be used for safety monitoring.  Unknown if it will allow you to take the hand off the wheel, like Ford's BlueCruise system or GM's SuperCruise.

When Enhanced Autopilot was available, you could get all of the auto lane change, Summon, and NoA features of FSD and just give up TACC traffic signal recognition and the yet to be released city NoA for much less of a capital spend.

The FSD package gets you the ability to just put on the turn signal and have the car execute the lane change while still in Autosteer, or to use Navigate on Autopilot where the car suggests and makes lane changes on its own to pass slower traffic or to follow the nav route.

They only called me when I called, which is not the best order of things to happen when you're about to purchase $50k vehicle. Don't want to compare to Audi/BMW/MB... but those guys are usually on top of these things.

I feel the 3 CS support team are inexperienced and not the same level of people who personally deliver S and X. I don't think they are ready to deliver 400k vehicles by just scaling up inexperienced CS team, and this will likely be a friction when Non-owners are starting to order and wondering about the status. It's not likely a issue at the moment since Tesla owners are somewhat used to getting turned around by Tesla from previous purchase.

In a less legal sense, a lemon is a car that just has a ton of problems, not just one, which are not easy to fix or are unfixable. A car that gives you too many issues to be worth it.

Your car having one issue does not in any sense make it a lemon. Having one issue is not indicative of future issues.

Software issues in a Tesla also don't mean much in regards to being a lemon or not since software updates are fairly frequent and issues come and go.

Restricted Speed
Autosteer is intended for use only by a fully attentive driver on freeways and highways where access is limited by entry and exit ramps. If you choose to use Autosteer on residential roads, a road without a center divider, or a road where access is not limited, Autosteer may limit the maximum allowed cruising speed and the touchscreen displays a message indicating that speed is restricted. The restricted speed can vary depending on whether or not you've specified a speed limit offset. Although you will be unable to increase the cruising speed, you can select a more restrictive cruising speed by reducing the speed limit offset, if applicable, (see Controlling Speed Assist on page 114) or by manually reducing the set cruising speed (see Changing the Set Speed on page 89).
In situations where the speed limit cannot be detected when Autosteer is engaged, Autosteer reduces your driving speed and limits the set speed to 45 mph (70 km/h). Although you can manually accelerate to exceed the limited speed, Model 3 may not brake for detected obstacles. Autosteer slows down to the limited speed when you release the accelerator pedal. When you leave the road, or disengage Autosteer by using the steering wheel, you can increase your set speed again, if desired.",[deleted],-1.0,-0.6409,False,True,False,-1.0,1440,False

- If money is concern, buying a new car is never a good idea. From this perspective I believe I made a mistake, but I plan to keep the car as long as it runs (hopefully 10 years) to make up for mistake of buying a new car.
- I also live in an apartment. They wanted to charge $250 for a designated parking with ev charger. I didn’t accept that since Fortunately I have access to free charging at work.
My point is it is not convenient to count on public charging all the time, unless you are driving short distance and you need to charge once a week. If that is not the case, save your money, buy a house and then buy an ev. Please note that using supercharger all the time is not recommended for the battery. You should only use it when traveling.
- my insurance only went up $10 / month which is great.

TeslaMotors,frustrating,c9u8dj,et35ze1,t3_c9u8dj,"I was in a similar situation.  We had an ‘08 Impreza that cost us over $4500 in maintenance costs over the last two years.  After the last $800 in repairs, we were really sick of it.  The car was in running condition and so we decided to sell it and get what little money we could from the car to put toward a down payment on a model 3.  We live in an apartment and have an underground garage.  The garage does have some standard 120V outlets along the wall, which are close to some parking spots.  Unfortunately we are not close to these.  Thankfully we have a public charger across the street (Level 2 charger).  We usually charge every other day, and so we park the car across the street after work, and then walk over to our apartment to relax.  After a few hours the car is charged up and we unplug it and park it in the garage.  There’s also a grocery store and several restaurants across the street, so we usually grab dinner or grocery shop while it’s charging.  For us, this isn’t really a big inconvenience.  Not having to pay for gas is HUGE.  Can’t understate how much we love this.  We’re close to 10,000 miles in and have only had to put washer fluid in the car.  We had our tires checked and there is almost no difference in wear, so a rotation isn’t really necessary, but that’s about all there is for maintenance on the car.  I did end up talking to my boss at work about installing a 240V outlet to charge the car.  My plan was to try and have my work install one at no cost to me, but my boss declined.  I offered to pay for the install and my boss said he’d think about it.  After digging further about hesitations, he was worried about the cost of electricity, which he would have to pay for.  After I showed him our current cost per KW (10.4 cents) and explained how much it would cost (~$30 a month), he softened up and said it would be fine.  It appears his main hesitation was thinking the electricity would cost a lot more to charge a car, when it’s actually a huge savings over gas.  Also, I went with a 240V instead of an actual Tesla charger because I explained that this outlet could serve as a hookup for other heavy pieces of equipment (we work in construction, so it wasn’t too far fetched).  The cost to install one was $255, and now I can charge at work.  

If you can afford a model 3 without financial strain, and you are in the market for a new car, then I wouldn’t recommend any other vehicle.  I would also explore charging options at work and see if there are any local incentives with the power company for installing “green” utilities.  This could get you some sort of break.  And if you haven’t test driven one yet, I’d schedule a test drive with your local showroom.  If you’re not near a showroom then you could use Turo, or take a leap of faith and utilize the 7 day/1,000 miles return policy.  

A lot of people also mention the total cost of ownership being lower than that of a Toyota Camry.  There are some InsideEV articles that have done the math.

The more financially smart move is to put the money into the car you have to fix it. We also did this for a while, but then got sick of having to always do this.  Once we had saved up enough and decided we wanted a new car, the Tesla was the easy choice.

Your insurance may also go up as a new cars value will be higher.  Based on everything you stated above, I would recommend not doing anything for a year and then reevaluating.

Honestly to me is sounds like the people you spoke to were completely correct.

The offer was you order a vehicle, and instead they give you an inventory vehicle with 1 free upgrade to ensure they get as many inventory vehicles delivered by the end of quarter as possible. 

Also even if they were wrong, and simply shut that ""free upgrade"" offer down, it's not like it's making your vehicle your ordering worse or like they are screwing you.

u/tayl428. Please can we have a few more details:

1. Exact location (which Supercharger stations)
2. Arrival State of Charge (eg. 10% battery)
3. Departure State of Charge 
3. Ambient Temperature outside of car
4. Temperature inside of car
4. Routed *via* Supercharger using navigation (ie. pre-warmed), or just driving *to* a Supercharger station for ""testing""?

There are ~four ways that come to mind to force a limit of ~30kW at a Supercharger outlet:

1. Half-inserting the charging outlet; causing the pins to warm up, and the maximum current to be limited for safety
2. Tickle charging above 90% on a Supercharger
3. Running the heaters on full blast, thereby defeating the battery cooling loop
4. Being second to arrive at a shared-Supercharger stall (eg. using 1A, when 1B is already in use)

All four of these would result in a limit ~30‒35kW, so hard to tell them apart…

Like with all EVs, managing charge is something you have to learn to do. I don't have any range anxiety, but I do think about it before going anywhere. In a gas car you can just stop and fill up when you run out. In an EV, you have to have charged up for your trip ahead of time. Superchargers make this planning much easier when you're taking the highway (I drive past three on my commute, so I can stop to charge up any day if necessary) but you still have to think about it before you take off.

TeslaMotors,complaint,byjm9h,eqipstl,t3_byjm9h,"For me: ""service anxiety"". I dread the day I need a repair from Tesla. But, non-accident repairs seem rare, from what I've read here, and Tesla seems to prioritize things that make your car un-drivable and warrantee service, so I'm thinking of trying to add a ""rental car while my car is unusable"" option on my insurance.

Also, you need to be alert to updates that could change the way you need to drive, e.g., ELDA, which strikes me as an overall benefit as long as it doesn't take you by surprise. I turned on regular LDA, to get used to reacting to the car steering itself.

But, as others have said, the balance is strongly positive. I've wanted to get away from gasoline for years, and the Model 3 lets me do so without compromising safety, performance, or range (I live in the supercharger-dense Northeast). And, for what looks like a relatively low per-year ownership cost (if repairs are anywhere near as rare as they are on the MS and MX ... though the cost is front-loaded), I get to get intro a fully-fueled vehicle each time I leave home (no stopping for gas), and get luxury-car features like climate-control from my phone (note that this improves range as well as confort, if you e.g. pre-heat the cabin before unplugging and getting in, in the winter).

So, those are my personal ""negatives"", in the context of my overall response, 6 months in.",davew_haverford_edu,3946.0,0.9564,False,False,False,3946.0,1360,False
TeslaMotors,complaint,byjm9h,eqj4uy0,t3_byjm9h,"I really can’t imagine driving anything else. Maybe if/when the other manufacturers catch up I’ll feel differently but for now I only want to drive my 3. 

That said, you are looking for honest negatives, so here goes:

1 auto wipers - IMO they are not bad and have definitely gotten better. They are better than any other car I’ve ever owned, but owners of other premium sedans say they are really bad. So whether they suck or are just ok depends on your perspective. 

2. Service - Service for regular repairs are spotty depending on the quality of your local SC and if you need body work because of an accident it can be a nightmare mainly because of waiting time for parts. Expect this to improve over time (hopefully). 

3.  Road noise/wind noise. For both, I think it is mostly a product of the noise being more prominent because if the lack of engine noise and vibration.  However, I think some of the early VIN definitely had an issue with window moundings that made wind noise. And road noise is definitely louder than many cars. If you are coming from a high end Audi/BMW/etc, I think it will be notable. Otherwise less of an issue. 

4. Cold weather - expect to see a big drop in efficiency. Currently with temps 60-80s, I regularly see efficiency in the 95%-110% range, meaning I can drive between 95-110 mikes on an indicated 100 miles of battery usage. In the winter this drops to about 80% on average but as low as 70% in extreme cold. This is due to the battery being less efficient in the cold and the heater taking a ridiculous amount of power. But even at its worse, my daily commute cost me ~ $3 instead of ~ $5. This time of year I estimate it at $2 or less. 
If you get a SR and your commute is very long, you could suffer a little range anxiety in very cold weather. Otherwise it is not a big issue, it just takes some planning.",DeuceSevin,214564.0,0.9409,False,False,False,214564.0,1851,False

With that said, it obviously causes uncertainty, doubt, regret, and buyer’s remorse. As someone that loves my car and wants to see them succeed and keep making cars... these are things I don’t particularly like to see them do.

It doesn’t matter if they can be explained or not.  It doesn’t matter if they are common in the industry or not.  Tesla is setting out to do and be something different and better than the traditional model.  If it wasn’t, it would just set up dealerships and do things the industry way.

Apple is a company that is similar in style in that they rarely have sales, give stores razor thin profits, and heavily control pricing.  If every few weeks they were dropping product lines, changing what is included, bringing product lines back, adjusting prices, etc... people would be freaking out.  The news would be all over it, and the unfortunate reality, is in this social based world where everyone’s opinion matters, news would explode over it.  People would be upset, and arguably, rightfully so.  And that is a much cheaper purchase scale wise with a lot less risk.

Tesla already gets a ton of bad press and most of it bullshit.  They already are too tightly watched and inspected for every mistake (even when not theirs).  They should be doing their best to at least pretend to be a consistent, stable company.  And picking a plan and sticking to it for a reasonable amount of time is part of that appearance.

You have to remember they don’t advertise, so everything is word of mouth.  When you choose not to advertise, you are choosing to save a ton of money on “selling” people on your concept and brand.  That means your concept and brand is built based entirely on what people say about you.  That means that the money you are saving should go into giving the best service and support possible, into making the best products, and into ensuring that your word of mouth is the best it can be.  Especially to those that have already bought in.  Part of that is making people feel secure about their purchases and not part of some bait and switch based on a whim to increase profits.  Part of that is to make sure people aren’t confused or don’t have remorse week to week for either making a purchase or waiting too long to make one.  Part of what helps that is clear consistent communication and transparency.  A plan that they stick to that shows they know what they are doing and help builds faith in the consumer.

Like I said, I’m very happy with my purchase and love my car.  I would pay more than I did for it.  I tell everyone how much I love it and how much it’s changed my life and my feeling about driving.  But as someone that wants to see Tesla succeed, I am not so ignorant or blind to not admit that they aren’t doing themselves any favors by following these patterns.  When I go to talk to someone about how much I love my car, the first 30 minutes shouldn’t be me fighting off everything bad someone has heard.  I’ll advertise for them.  I’ll do my part free of charge (don’t even need a free roadster..... or two...like some people), but Tesla has to do their part too.

So I don’t think it’s fair to say people should stop whining, suck it up, and that it doesn’t matter.  It obviously does and to a lot of people.",robotshavehearts2,18036.0,0.9851,False,False,False,18036.0,3350,False

I am still hoping Tesla will make it right a few months from now, maybe in 2020 with additional price cuts to reach the $35k price point. 

&#x200B;

I understand you get (way) more than originally expected (roof, seats, audio system, range, etc.) but going from $35k to $39.5k base price is a huge miss on their part. 

&#x200B;

I would have prefered they wait another 6 months to a year to communicate on the $35k version and actually offer it. It would have been actually quite nice to see the gradual progress: LR, then MR, then SR+, and finally SR. But I am sure it would have cost them a ton of cash to have to produce different textile seats, metal roof, manually adjustable wheel, etc. just for 10 to 15% of their total production.

Really interesting to see that it now can detect ""drivable"" street surfaces.

This actually confirms my theory! And something I think no or almost none of the other car manufacturers do right now in their lane assistance systems? This is also a very basic requirement to implement FSD as a long-term goal.

And according the ""Why Tesla isn't more transparent?"": I think they just try to hold their cards close to their chest, so that their competition doesn't know how far (or close?) they actually are pushing towards FSD. All of the information you revealed shows us that they already put the foundation into place for much more functionality than the current AP actually provides to the user at the moment. They seem to be working on many of these things in parallel (e.g. the traffic light detection, ... as you said; even though it doesn't seem to be ready for prime-time yet). I feel like AP v9 will be a huge step forward where a lot of this work falls into place and then all in a sudden adds up in a huge improvement.

TeslaMotors,complaint,reu9ss,hoehs94,t3_reu9ss,"Oof, buddy you’re asking to get crucified with a post like this. RIP.

I’ll play devil’s advocate and agree with you on almost every single point and add in a few of my own.

I got my wife a Y at the end of September to replace her hand-me-down Model 3 since we needed some extra room/practicality with a puppy. Almost immediately the trouble started. We woke up to the vehicle flashing that same message. In our situation, it was a failed inverter for the rear motor. Exiting the vehicle, locking it and getting back in cleared the error and the car drove as expected. This leads me to my biggest gripe with Tesla and the leading issue on why I almost NEVER recommend them to friends and family.

**Service**: It’s absolutely a nightmare trying to schedule these appointments without being able to talk to a human in real time.

It took over 2 months just to get her vehicle in for service with a guaranteed loaner reserved. This has been a similar experience with our other Tesla service requests.

**Build Quality**: I’m going to combine several points under this category.

Moving from a BMW to my first Model 3 was a bit of a shock. The number of panels that flexed/creaked and or felt hollow is just downright disappointing. Of the 3 Teslas we’ve purchased, ironically the Y was nearly perfect on my walk through despite being the only vehicle with a mechanical failure.

As for your point regarding the doors, my wife HATES how hard she has to close them (and never fails to remind me) but my gripe is the sound they make when closed. It lacks the solid “thunk” you get with the German rivals.

Don’t get me started on the visors. While I like the new magnetic lock idea (execution kind of sucks) the quality of these is indeed very “down market” but the headliner is a bit of a wash. I like it more than my 3 series, but far less than the S or X. I’d happily pay Tesla a few thousand extra for an “ultra” premium interior with a nicer headliner, dash, trim and vanity items.

Floor mats just suck no matter what. Nice carpet is still carpet. I chuck these at pickup and put in all-weather mats.

Technology: Personally, not being able to choose a routing option that avoids Highways irks me more than any of your other tech points. 

The Y is one giant Blind-spot and we just leave the cameras on while driving. One of these days, I may get around to installing the rearview mirror display I put in my BMW.

I will say this, not including HomeLink is becoming increasingly uncommon but I think that has more to do with manufactures forcing you into some “tech package” with the vehicle trim you’d actually want. One way or another, you’re paying for it. If my previous Model 3 hadn’t included this as standard I don’t know if I ever would have purchased it for my current 3 or the wife’s Y but even she gave the go-ahead for scheduling installation which says a lot for the added convenience.

**Performance**: Initially I was looking into upgrading to a Y Performance from a 3 LR AWD. I was completely underwhelmed by acceleration on the test drive and didn’t realize how much faster it was until I got back into my 3. Ended up purchasing a 3 Performance instead (I’m still a little bored with the acceleration there as well).

The suspension on the Y Performance is indeed harsh. Most likely the exact same equipment from the 3 adjusted stiffer to account for the extra bulk. Not much of a fan myself. Also not remotely fair to compare against a Cayman. Horse drawn carriages I hear are pretty harsh too.

>  
Closing the Door: You have to pull pretty hard to actually close the door. It wasn't just me either. Multiple people failed to close the door properly the first time they tried.

My new Plaid S is the same. Every person that's closed the doors has actually had to go back and re-do it. The doors have to be closed very hard - much harder than expected. 

&#x200B;

>Honk Upon Lock: I can't believe this car makes a cheap honk sound when you lock it like some early 2000s GM car. It should 100% have some pleasant sounding chip/beep.

I think you can turn this off. In the S, I think you can also change the sound it plays - although I'm not sure if that applies to the lock sound. Personally, I hate the chirp and leave it always disabled. 

&#x200B;

>There isn't even an easy way to activate Siri since the in-car voice button will trigger the Tesla voice assistant.

\+1. My normal voice use case is ""Call $restaurant in $location"". It's quite unexpected that this doesn't work unless I manually trigger Siri on the phone. 

&#x200B;

>is there actually no way to view a list of all music on my iPhone and pick something?

The lack of Apple Music integration here is really the core problem. I bought the $7.99 / month Tidal plan to get quality native music. Bluetooth to the phone has been ok, but not stellar. 

&#x200B;

>Auto Dimming Mirrors: These work well enough, but the portion of the mirror that auto dims is small.

The Model S also has very poor dimming mirrors. The first few nights I drove the it, I was convinced it didn't have dimming at all. This is especially true for the rear-view mirror as it's blinding. I've not had that experience in decades... 

&#x200B;

>Straight Line Speed: It's actually not as fast as I expected.

I haven't had that problem, but I'm in the Plaid with is violent. With that said, I do think people underestimate modern Gas cars. They're not slow. 

&#x200B;

>Auto High Beam: Very inconsistent and basically unusable in my short night time testing.

I've had to disable this, as it's effectively useless. Hopefully it improves.

TeslaMotors,complaint,7b53be,dpfakg6,t3_7b53be,"The best guess I have is this:

The original ramp rate for the Model 3 was a goal of 5k/week production by the end of December. What they announced wasn't a delay in production by 3 months, but rather a delay in the goal of 5k/week to end of the next quarter.  So it's not a pure 3 month stoppage of production, but a much longer ramp up period than their previous (extremely audacious) original ramp rate.

Here's what it seems like the change was in total output:

          Original     New
    Aug:   100         100
    Sept: ~1,500       160
    Oct:  ~5,000      ~500

    Feb:   -          ~10,000
    Mar:   -          ~20,000

If that’s the case, it makes sense why the 3rd row costs $3,000 when it probably costs Tesla 1/6 of that to manufacture the 3rd row seat itself. It also makes sense that Tesla will be doing huge batches of 5 seaters prior to the release of the 7 seater. I do still find it odd that the 7 seater can’t even be preordered. Either there is going to be a cost bump or something more.

Similar to the Model X 6 seater, Tesla is going to have to upgrade/modify the second row seating set up as well, so the upgrade cost is more than just the jump seat.

Is it possible there may be an even bigger change? Is it possible that there will be some minor tweaks in the interior/exterior dimensions and this is why Tesla isn’t releasing information on measurements. If people knew the 7 seater was going to be a couple inches longer or wider, have more headroom due to a roofline tweak, different cargo space, etc. would it make people delay their current Y or X orders? It may seem like a long shot but I don’t count Tesla out for anything.

Most likely the exterior frame is identical so I have a request. I don’t have any photoshop skills myself, but would it be possible for someone to line the rear passenger roofline of the Model S with the 3rd row area of the Model Y? I find there is plenty of space as a passenger in the S, so it would be pretty telling to see how functional the Y 3rd row will be if the headroom is pretty similar. My biggest concern with the third row is safety in the unlikely event of a rollover. I’d want to make sure my passengers head isn’t up in the glass roof area.

TeslaMotors,complaint,c2wd0h,ero26z1,t3_c2wd0h,"I am arguably a traditional car enthusiast, and a Model 3 owner, and I appreciate many of your points. Briefly:- **The seat**: Those who have tried Tesla seats that I know have either commented on how extraordinarily comfortable they are, or haven't commented. This is the first I have heard of someone strongly disliking Model 3 seats. Indeed, we are all different. Good thing for aftermarket seats, though it is sad they would be almost necessary in your case.

\- **Blind spot**: If you use your turning signal, the car does an excellent job of warning you about blind spot issues. That is no justification for the mirror's lack of flexibility, though I have been happy with my mirrors.

\- **BMW-style turning signals**: This.

\-  **Take away the acceleration, and you may as well be driving a slightly quieter Civic**. This surprised me, especially coming from a sports car owner. The Model 3's track performance and suspension are almost universally salivated over.

\- **Acceleration**: My Performance model also clearly loses its aggressive acceleration at around 60-70MPH. It's still quicker than most cars by the numbers, but the downward change is much more noticeable after the intense 0-60 acceleration.

\- **Missing Carplay, ventilated seats**: Android Auto, heated steering wheel, auto-opening trunk, air lift suspension, etc. The Model 3 has many, many features that most or no other car has. I suppose as a matter of cost, they had to cut others. Some of these are available aftermarket, but not the two you mentioned.

\- **Center screen reboots**: I have had these a few times as well, and a few other times I have had to initiate the reboot myself. Rare, not a big deal, but a bit embarrassing. The root causes get ironed out over time with OTA updates, but it isn't perfect yet.

\- **Glass roof heat**: This surprised me as well because I can detect only the slightest IR warmth on a hot day. There's always tint, and there is indeed a cover for the roof on Tesla's website and aftermarket.

\- **Autopilot limitations**: Agreed. These will hopefully all be ironed out with free updates. As a software developer, I acknowledge the awesome complexity of Autopilot's goals, but still it is installed in cars today and does have some limitations that are far from trivial.

\- **Cruise control**: Indeed, my car came with basic traffic-oblivious cruise control. Traffic-aware is, or at least was, only available with purchase of Autopilot, though once enabled, I do not know if it can be turned off. Still, you can absolutely adjust its sensitivity. At lower settings, I very rarely experience phantom braking at the like, though I usually set mine to high sensitivity and range.

\-**One-pedal driving**: Your notes are more a preference than a flaw, but they are also my preference. I would like one-pedal driving to never require the brakes as well. Still, once used to it, I find the experience very refined. The recharge curve, for example, feels to me like a lot of thought went into the speed at which deceleration takes place.

\- **Weight of the car**: The Model 3 is clearly amazingly nimble for its weight, as you say, but is of course a good 500lbs heavier than, say, a BMW M3. A good chunk of that can be shaved off with aftermarket wheels, a lighter 12v battery, and other changes but at a cost. That said, you probably drove using the standard ultra-low rolling resistance all-season tires. Grippier tires make a huge difference -- more so than with most cars in my opinion.

\- **Cargo**: ""Not a hatchback"" is not the same is ""not practical"". I find the opposite -- the Model 3 has vast storage space compared to most cars I have owned --around twice what your MS3 has -- about as must as a Mercedes GLA. The trunk opening is not as large as some, and certainly not as large as the Model S or other hatchbacks, but I can still fit a huge stroller (BOB Rambler Jogging Stroller) a car seat base, a booster seat, 5 1-gallon containers, and several bags of groceries, and that doesn't include the frunk or extra space under the trunk, or the fact that the seats can fold down. In this one, I have to say your statement that the Model 3 is ""not very practical"" is simply incorrect.

Good for large cargo? Not for most. Lots of room for ordinary cargo? Absolutely a yes. Practical? Very.

\- **Emotion, Story**: Evoking emotion is a subjective personal matter, but I cannot understand how you would think the Model 3 doesn't have a story. I suggest you do some reading about its history. Watch the Monroe videos. Consider how very different the car is in so many ways, and the risks that went into making it so. It's no Mercedes-Benz W 125 or Tucker 48, nor does it have a shocking underdog Le Mans win (though it has been disqualified from wins for using an underdog propulsion method), but I would argue that it has one of the best stories of any non-corner case production car.

> The Chevy Bolt has a paddle you can pull to enable regen, which I much prefer as it allows you much finer control while also allowing you to rest your foot and just coast as you would in a gas car.

I've driven a Bolt, and I *hated* the paddle. It's totally unintuitive to slow down your car with a hand gesture, rather than a foot gesture. Plus, you can get fine control in a Tesla by applying less pressure to the accelerator. If all you ever did was ""hit the gas"" and ""take your foot off the pedal"" I can see why you had a hard time, but that's not the way to do one-pedal driving.

I've learned what kinds of situations AP deals with poorly (e.g. consecutive lane changes in heavy traffic) and I just handle those manually.

That said, I don't think you'll see Model 3's upgraded battery approaching Model S's battery size - maybe in the 270 range on the top end.

By my back-of-the-napkin fuzzy math, that leaves you with a 55kWh battery and a 70 kWh battery. Given the more advanced, cheaper cells that should be in the Model 3 (which is known as a core feature), and the smaller size differential of the pack, I think you could see that coming down as low as $5k as an option. 

I believe Elon had stated that he wanted the pack to be $10k before for the Model 3, so if that's achieved, a $5k 15kWh boost is actually a better sale for Tesla than the default pack. Similar to Model S, I think you would see that including Supercharging, but if they come all the way down to $5k it might be separate.

TeslaMotors,complaint,4dsudi,d1u349b,t3_4dsudi,"Here is my estimate of costs adjusted for the slightly lower costs of the model 3. I think at this price point, they're going to need to reduce options costs over the S to make them more realistic to the purchase price (and also because of volume causing cost reductions).

- Base price, $35,000
- Supercharging enabled, $1,000-2,000
- Dual-motor AWD, $3,000
- Autopilot enabled, $1,000-1,500
- Smart air suspension, $1,500-2,000
- Sub-zero weather package, $500-1,000
- Solid Panoramic roof, $0 - included (opening panoramic roof $1,000 extra)
- Leather interior, $1,500-2,000
- Premium interior & lighting,  $1,500-2,000
- Ultra high-fidelity sound, $500-1,500
- Battery upgrade, $5,000-7,500 (expecting maybe 55kWh and 70kWh batteries at $100/kWh actual cost with added profit)
- Upgraded paint, $750-1,000 (only value likely not to change much)

This estimates the price somewhere between ~$50,000 all the way up to ~$60,000 for what you're looking for. I do expect many of these things to be packaged up into various packages so you might not be able to order some things individually.

A few other speculative guesses:

- Performance (requires AWD, battery upgrade), $5,000-10,000 (may come with other details like the rotors or a spoiler just like S)
- Data connectivity (user access to online features inside car and with remote access, OTA updates still available), $1,000-2,000
- Wheel/tire upgrades, $2,500-5,000

I'm expecting a fully optioned car to top out at $70,000, if not less. I just can't see a way for all the upgrades to go up beyond that. For those worried about cannibalizing model S sales, I think it's clear that Tesla will be adding more stuff to the S to make it more of a luxury item to justify the price. They'll be able to use the additional margins afforded to them by the gigafactory to do this.

Elon said that he expects the average order to be $42,000 so the average person will opt for only $7,000 in upgrades. The average person will opt for the most popular upgrades (which will probably be supercharging plus AWD or battery) plus paint upgrade and a couple of other smaller upgrades like winter package or interior upgrades- .",geoffreak,4320.0,0.9577,False,False,False,4320.0,2166,False
TeslaMotors,complaint,4dsudi,d1tzspm,t3_4dsudi,"I'm thinking supercharging will be less than that. Like other things they needed the model S guinea pigs to more front the cost of super chargers than model 3 people may be asked to do. Also, was it a given the hardware was standard on those s's?

I could see as low as $500, I'm hoping for $1000. I'd be a little surprised if it's more than $2000, unless there was a package with a wall charger for home. 

Autopilot might be more but it also might be part of a ""tech package"" type stand in with nav and data and whatnot. I'm hoping stand alone is <= $2000, or a ""tech package"" approach is <= $4000 ish. 

I'm also hoping the fixed glass roof is standard or <= $1000. I, or my wife, have talked ourselves into a sunroof the last 3 vehicles and I can probably count on one hand the number of times they've been open, but fixed glass sounds awesome.

&#x200B;

\- Car pre-heat doesn't work in an ideal way since the front/rear defrost doesn't turn on (reports are 50.6 fixes this for rear defrost). Would like to have a way to turn on defrost manually.

\- I cant seem to find a good HVAC setting that keeps the front window clear in really cold (-10C or colder).  When driving on the highway when its very cold, I need to turn on the front defrost every 5min or the window starts to freeze up and ice gets stuck to the wipers.  This makes the cabin too hot, then I have to turn off and repeat when the window starts freezing again. Would be nice to have a setting for front defrost other than HI or OFF. Maybe I am missing something.

\- The window seals stick every now and then even tho I have applied silicone lube which does help.  Before the 'winter update' fix a moth ago and before i applied silicone, I damaged the chrome trim not realizing that the window was stuck up and slamming the door. This issue isn't really due to extreme cold but due to the snow melting when driving, then freezing the window and seal together.  It can happen in any freezing temp, not just super cold.   I think the problem is that the window motor is weak compared to other frameless windows (a family member has a mini cooper without this problem).  To solve this, after a drive when things are warmed up, I usually wipe away the build-up of ice/slush along the door/window seal so it cant freeze everything together.

\- Auto wipers don't have great timing with the highway spray or a light snow/rain. Also, would be nice to have the auto/manual controls accessible via the stock on the main screen (not two+ touches away).

&#x200B;

Overall first world problems. Love the car and confident that Tesla will fix some of these perceived issues with software. Oh, I also don't have the dreaded charge port issue that people in the cold seem to be complaining about. My vin is 95xxx so maybe they fixed the hardware.

TeslaMotors,complaint,aldv9m,efddalm,t3_aldv9m,"My polar vortex experience in Chicago has been mostly positive as well. Monday same as you we got snow but not nearly that much. About 6 inches I would say. I waited until the roads were mostly clear and then left. There was some left over slush and that was fine with my winter tires. Going up a steep loading dock ramp the other day I did lose traction to the point that I had to backup and try again but that was because of lack of momentum mostly. I went up slow just to see how it would handle. It almost made it but then trying again with a bit more speed initially it made it up without any issues. 

I share your issue with the windshield wipers. They get a bit streaky and I worry sometimes if using them will make the window better or worse. 

The cabin for me is usually toasty but can get a little drafty to me on occasion and turning fan and heat to HI seems to produce a cool air blowing out which is obviously not great. Turning on the front windshield defroster usually creates some nice strong heat so that's my solution for now when necessary. 

The biggest issue I noticed this morning driving in when it was -20 out was my steering felt quite stiff and was worse after the 50 minute drive to work. Also it was kinda groaning / squeaking as I turned it. I'm sure this is from the cold but I hope that it doesn't get any worse on my way home. If it doesn't go away when the weather warms I'll take it in for service. Anyone else have this happen?

Range was significantly reduced this morning. I left with 66% (didn't fully charge as was planning to charge at work) and got to work with 46%. I wasn't driving particularly efficiently though and had the heat up a bit around 71. Trip meter said I had driven 26.4 miles at 440Wh/mi which is about double what I have got in the past on my most efficient drives in the summer with mild temps. Before this in like 20 to 30 degree or more normal winter temps for the area I was seeing about a 30% decrease in efficiency.

TeslaMotors,complaint,epfrp7,fejmu2g,t3_epfrp7,"One thing to still consider when looking at the range in winter; One gallon of gas is worth about 33 kWh of electricity. So given Model 3 Long range batteries are 75\~ kWh packs this means Model 3 has 2.2 gallon fuel tank if it were holding gasoline and could somehow extract all that potential energy (which is impossible). So that 50% cut in range (say 150 miles) the car is still getting 68 MPG equivalent!! 

This just shows:

1) How many kWh of energy a gas car can hold in a tank (ex: 12 gallons of fuel = 404 kWh!!), and therefore how wasteful they are since only 17%–21% of that energy drives the wheels. The other 80% is waste heat that is perfectly used for keeping the interior warm.

2) Electric cars are so efficient that any extra energy use has a direct cut in range. 

3) Electrics are still crazy efficient in the winter.

Winter isn't a problem 98% of the time with home (or work for some) charging.

https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/gpd2ui/tried_out_the_model_y_last_weekend_and_currently?sort=confidence

We have had a LR RWD 3 for over 2 years and a P100D X since the summer. Was debating to switch the 3 for a Y sometime in the future since lots of reviews mentioned how big it was and we have a growing family. Took a family members PY for the weekend to test it out and came out underwhelmed.

The Y is quick and handles well for it's size like a Model 3. Still think the 3 is more nimble and more fun compared to the Y probably due to the 3 being lower and smaller but it felt more fun to drive vs a S/X. The Y felt more agile and drives like a car vs a suv which is a huge plus in my book and I'd definitely put it above a Macan S in the fun factor department. Love the interior layout and efficiency and ease of use of the 3 and the Y felt exactly the same. The hatch makes it easier to load things into a trunk vs a 3 but with the back row up it wasnt all that much different in terms of what I can fit. A full size Vista stroller took a significant amount of space in the Y but it was much easier to load. 

The Y also had the biggest downsides I experienced in the 3 carry over. The rear passenger space and comfort is not much improved over a 3. We have a rear facing car seat currently and will need another one in a few months. Have a Britax Boulevard, Uppababy Mesa and Diono radian with angle adjuster and it's a challenge getting a baby in all besides the Mesa infant seat. You have to bend down and do some gymnastics to get the baby in and I have felt the door height on the 3 is kind of tight. Sadly, the Y was difficult using a rear facing car seat too. Forward facing car seats shouldn't be an issue in either a 3 or Y but those planning on kids need to remember that most babies stay in rear facing for around 2 years, and multiply that by number of kids you will have. The 6 seater X is on a whole different world in terms of comfort, can't even be compared. The captains chairs are electronic and can move easily to make room for rear passengers. The falcon wing doors are also incredible in the X. You can literally walk into the car and stand and load a baby into a car seat, once you have experienced it, it's hard to ever go back.

Overall the Y is a great package and feels just like the 3 with some added storage and height. Its an excellent CUV and will be ideal for many people who are looking at BMW x3,x2 Mercedes GLC or RAV4 size. I can't recommend it as a full size SUV or minivan replacement or as a true X alternative. It's more similar to the 3 in terms of size vs an X.",Turtlesz,10568.0,0.9971,False,False,False,10568.0,2655,False

I recently made the big decision and ordered a MS60 (with AP2.0 and sunroof).  I had a very early Model 3 preorder reservation, but decided to buy a Model S now instead.  Here are a few things that led me to the jump:  
-Getting full federal tax credit now vs reduced in the future (either by Tesla getting 200k before my Model 3 gets delivered, or by government cutting the tax credits)  
-Low interest rates now, due to the possibility of a rate hike in December  
-Free Supercharging going away for cars ordered after January 1st  
-Get to drive my dream car now instead of ""someday"" in the future  
-Belief that a well equipped Model 3 in 2 years might only cost a few thousand less than an entry level Model S now  

You may want to check out a local Tesla store to see if you will be happy without the white interior.  If the range of the 60D is suitable for your lifestyle, and you don't mind not having the performance of the 90D, then you could save quite a bit of money with the 60D (as mentioned in another post it comes with a physical 75 kWh battery, so it's unlikely battery degradation will be noticeable in the 60).

Yes investments are great, but so is enjoying life.  I'd say now is a pretty great time to buy with AP2.0 being released a few weeks ago and Free Supercharging going away for new orders in January.  Also, there is currently a $1000 discount for using a referral code good until January 15th.  I sent you a code via PM in case you don't have one already.

My wife's commute has gotten shorter and I work from home, so our weekly average miles have plummeted in recent years. And we make several trips per to one of those black holes of supercharger coverage. And we don't know where we'll be in 4 years - might not need a car at all next year!

TeslaMotors,complaint,9yoyeo,ea39ubl,t3_9yoyeo,"Here's a bit more in-depth of why this is.  

Think of a seesaw. It's most fun when both are going mostly all the way up and down. If one is just sitting on the ground while the other is stuck in the air, that's just no fun.  

Batteries are healthiest at 50%. An equal balance between the anode and cathode. Above 50%, the electrons in the side that has more try to push themselves to the side that has less, which damages the battery.  

The longer *AND* higher this imbalance, the worse it is. So if you charge to 100% *and* keep it there, that's bad. But if you immediately use the battery after is at 100%, it's not that bad.  

The 80% rule is for two things: 1) It's better for the battery to sit at 80% for a long time than it is at 100%. There's less pressure for the electrons to go to the other side. 2) 80% is closer to 50%, meaning you're more likely to drain the battery below 50%. At 40%, the battery will be happier than it would be at 80%, because 40% is closer to 50% than 80%. (Hope that makes sense.).

Before using ANC, Tesla needs to implement halfway decent dampening in the cabin.  You get the biggest bang for the buck with passive noise cancelling.  The X and S can borrow a lot from the S-Class dampening.",xqze6m6ogWo2,2035.0,-0.0428,False,False,False,2035.0,795,False

TeslaMotors,complaint,dprwxw,f60sqym,t3_dprwxw,"ANC is best at damping low frequency harmonic sounds, such as a reciprocating engine.  They generally fail at higher frequencies such as road and wind noise.  Somewhat higher frequency cancelling can be achieved when you put the microphone and speaker right at the ear, as the ear piece has a small volume and supports only single modes at relatively high frequencies.  Higher frequency sounds form literally billions of different modes in a large and complex volume like a car's interior, which would require almost infinite microphones, speakers, and processing power to counteract.

To understand this better, try beating your hand at various frequencies in a large liquid volume like a spa or bathtub.  Low frequencies will make simple oscillations back and forth, easy to counteract with someone elses hand if you could time it just right.  Now do it super fast... you'll see a complex pattern of peaks and valleys dancing all across the tub.  You might be looking at dozens or more modes interfering with each other now.  Do the same test in a small bowl and you'll find that you almost can't move your hand fast enough to make a complex pattern.

TeslaMotors,complaint,4kgr76,d3f2snp,t3_4kgr76,"formatting: 

It's been a week since I picked up my October 2012 P85, and I wanted to share my thoughts and concerns with current owners as well as those considering purchasing a used or CPO Model S.
I spent a lot of time researching CPO cars, and familiarizing myself with every available option and feature. I went into the buying process with extremely high expectations, and after finalizing my various spreadsheets, checking my numbers, doing multiple test drives, double checking tax and fuel implications, and annoying my wife non-stop about everything Tesla, I finally pulled the trigger.
When my wife and I initially drove out of the Tesla Service Center with our new-to-us P85, I had a ton of buyer's remorse. I've never spent more than $20k on a car, I've never considered anything but used Toyotas worth my time and money, and I've never had a car payment. And here I was driving out of the lot with a $48k loan, and trepidation about the reliability, long term value, and practicality of a nearly 4 year old luxury electric vehicle. I was sure I had just committed one of the gravest errors of my adult life. How could I have been so stupid?!?
To calm my nerves, I inwardly agreed with myself that I would give it exactly one month, and if at that point I couldn't justify such an extravagant purchase, I'd sale the stupid thing and go find a used 4Runner.
So off we drove. I'll try to organize my observations to answer some of the frequent questions I hear as well as the questions I had before buying.

**How’s the performance?**

The first thing we realized is that we needed to put our radar/laser detector in our new Tesla ASAP. We had been on multiple test drives before buying, but we never realized how quickly we would settle into going 0-60 mph in 3.9 seconds at every opportunity, or going 45 to 65 on state roads on open stretches, or 75 up to nearly triple digits on those wide open Texas interstates. We have seriously had to regulate our enthusiasm on a daily basis. It’s just too damn easy to annihilate whatever speed limit you're supposed to be following.

**How does the P85 compare to the P85+?**

I’ve never driven a P85+, but I can tell you that the P85 is a little loose in the back when cornering. Accelerating out of turns is not always predictable, and I can understand how others may very much prefer the stability and advanced tuning in the P85+. However, for my purposes, the P85 is great. It’s smooth enough that my family rides in it comfortably, and it’s fast and responsive enough to make even a trip to the grocery store a lot of fun. If you want to do James Bond style maneuvers on the daily, hold out for the P85+. If you want to occasionally imagine you’re James Bond on the way to dropping your kids off at school, get the P85.

**Do you miss not having a pano roof?**

I really wanted a pano roof. It was near the top of my list of features I was looking for in a CPO. Honestly, I can’t say that it matters much to me at this point. Since I’m usually in one of the front seats, I can’t tell what the roof looks like anyways. When I sit in the back seat, even at 6’4” I don’t feel like it’s a problem. I would probably like a pano if I had it, but it has seriously been a non-issue for me since I bought the car. If you can get a car with a pano, I say go for it. If you find a good deal on a CPO and the only thing missing is a pano, go for it as well.

**Is that huge screen distracting?**

I’ve had touch screens in my other cars prior to owning a Model S, and I thought the 17” screen Tesla uses was over kill. Until now. I love that giant oversized screen! It’s smooth and responsive, intuitive, easy to use, easy to see, and very functional. The software works very well, and I wish I had a similar option in my other vehicles. The display unit in the driver’s side dash is also very helpful. I really like the steering wheel controls as well. Overall, it’s a really nice experience, and I’m glad Tesla went above and beyond with these particular features. Could they be better? Probably. But I find nothing to complain about with the way things are currently. I have considered upgrading to 4G LTE, but right now my wife and I agree that the 3G is fine.

**Is the upgraded sound system worth it?**

While the pano roof was near the top of my ‘wants’ list, the upgraded sound system was near the bottom. I’m not an audiophile, and I figured there were other features I’d rather pay for. But if I had to choose today between keeping the upgraded sound system or adding a pano roof to the car, I’d pick the sound system. I never anticipated enjoying listening to music so much in this car, but it really is a great experience. The overall range could probably be a little bit better, and I know there are better systems out there, but Tesla has opted for a high quality, well balanced set up that really is a pleasure to listen to.
Have you noticed any issues with the quality of the vehicle?
I’ve read a lot of negative comments online regarding the 2012 Model S build quality. For my particular vehicle, I cannot tell that it is any different that the 2015 and 2016 Model S test drive vehicles I’ve ridden in and driven in the past. There are no creaks or malfunctioning parts (yet) that I have noticed. If anything, I am blown away with how beautiful and perfect this car is. A friend that test drove and is considering a P90D rode in my car with me for a while, and she commented that she was surprised to find that she couldn’t tell a single difference between the interior of my car and the car she test drove a couple of weeks ago. Obviously, Tesla uses some different parts and engineering in some places today than they did 3.5 years ago, but I think since I don’t have the pano roof, the number of variables and exchanged parts are not significant. It’s also possible that in the 3.5 years since this car was manufactured, Tesla has already swapped out any parts that might have originally created issues for the first owner.

**What do you think of the air suspension?**

While the air suspension is a cool feature, I don’t think most people need it. I live on a dirt road that has some pretty bad ruts in it, and don’t really see the need for using the air suspension. I have not bottomed out on anything yet. It impresses my friends when I show it off, but I bet it’ll cost a fortune to fix when it’s not covered under warranty.

**Do you like using Slacker to listen to music?**

I normally use Google Music at home or in a different vehicle, and I find Slacker radio to be a step behind. While it’s easy enough to use, I prefer being able to search for albums and podcasts. A teenage son of a friend of mine wasn't familiar with Slacker, and when I explained the concept to him he said, “Oh, you mean the most advanced car in the world uses a music player from 2010, right?” And he’s pretty much right. However, the built in Slacker interface is fine for generating radio stations, and hopefully it will get better as we like or dislike certain songs. Obviously, we can play Google Music through Bluetooth, but I’d prefer having the ability to link up the car directly to my Google Music account. Oh well, it’s a small complaint.

**How are the seats? Can tall people sit in the second row?**

Coming from non-luxury and non-performance vehicles, I find the front seats very comfortable. The lumbar support is nice, and the seat warmer function works just fine. I haven’t been on a long road trip yet, so my opinion could change once I have to spend several hours in a row in the car. In the second row, if I sit straight up, at 6’4” my head hits the roof liner. In a car with a pano roof, it doesn’t. However, I don’t really sit straight up while riding in any car, so if I sit comfortably, I usually have about half an inch to an inch of headroom. Honestly, I don’t really think about it when riding in the second row. But if I was an inch or two taller, it would probably be uncomfortable.

**Should I buy a CPO Model S or wait for the Model 3 to come out?**

While everyone has to make this decision on their own, I personally am very happy to have a CPO Model S while also waiting to purchase a Model 3 in a couple of years. While it’s possible I could have a Model 3 in as little as 18 months from now, I also believe it could be 24 or 36 months from now. And since I’m planning on putting in a third row in my Model S and the Model 3 will never have the option of a third row, as a family vehicle I prefer the Model S. In essence, since I can afford either, I’d rather take the Model S today than wait for the Model 3. If you can find a CPO Model S around $45k that you like, I say buy it, drive it for a couple of years, enjoy all the great things about the Model S, and then decide in a couple of years if you want to keep it or switch to the Model 3. Who knows, maybe you’ll end up buying a Model 3 as well as keeping your Model S. What's the only thing better than having a Tesla in your garage?

The easy answer for now and the near future is that the cars won't even know what hit them. Their systems are not designed to detect such objects and no one wants to spend time and money on solving an edge case when the main case (autonomy) hasn't been solved.

Eventually the car will be able to detect potholes and large(r) road debris but it may never be ""perfect"".

Potholes are quite easy to detect (certain shape/color that doesn't match the rest of the road, depth detection, detection based on the behavior of the vehicles in front, etc) and there are papers and hobbyists out there doing it already. Potholes full of water, snow or whatever are a different beast and other than highly sophisticated vision (cameras) or alerts from cars that already encountered them I am not sure there is a better solution.

Road debris can be quite challenging and may be very difficult to solve (especially if it's something that's coming from the vehicle directly in front) but I am sure some solutions will be implemented.

I’d ask about your current power usage and ask what the options are to meet your maximum usage on your most energy usage month.  

I’d ask about what you could do to do slightly more than that.  There’s never an issue with having too much energy, but not enough can be an issue.

Also, make sure you account for the added energy usage if recharging an extra electric car. 

Ask about how easy it is to upgrade your system should you need to.

I’d ask them about maintenance so you know how to take care of them.

I’d ask what happens if one panel is under performing.

I’d ask about the price of adding a battery today versus later and the cost of a second battery later vs today.  I say this because when I talked to them, adding the first battery is the most expensive and adding a second was way easier.  So the main issue is adding the first battery.

I’d ask them what questions you should ask or what they’d tell a friend who was thinking about solar panels...a friend they like lol. 

2.

If you have net metering, I don’t necessarily see the benefit of a battery unless you have frequent power outages or have elderly people and/or medications to worry about.  Not all states require net metering and Texas doesn’t, but some companies do offer an energy buyback program.

If you’re unfamiliar with net metering, I can go into detail if you’d like. 

If you’re dealing with 1-2 outages a year, honestly the batteries are a premium and you can add them later.  The battery tech will keep getting cheaper and better.  Eventually, solid state batteries will be the gold standard and that’s what I would want.  Solid state batteries are basically metal batteries that don’t need maintenance and won’t explode on you like regular batteries can (even if it’s rare).

3.

Some people were over promised on solar.  They were maybe told the system could do XYZ, but the system never did that.  

For example, you can do them in series or parallel and if one panel goes down then the entire system goes down.  That issue has largely been fixed on newer systems due to micro controllers, but if you got an older system before those controllers came out, one bad panel or a fallen leaf screwed up your entire system.

I think tesla panels have this accounted for, but I added that question.

4.

I didn’t pull the trigger because Tesla sucked at taking me seriously and reading the documents I gave them.  Based on my calculations, their basic system would have worked for me, but they kept wanting my bills and when I sent them they weren’t happy with the pdf and they wouldn’t take energy usage from my energy company.

But if I simply said yes, they were ready to install within 3 weeks and despite issues they were still way better than other energy companies.  

Honestly, once you get the total cost of and size of the system, google the price of a similar system.  Honestly, looking them up, Tesla’s price wasn’t half bad after incentives. You can save money doing it yourself, but then you run into issues with permits and the electric company and that’s worth the price to not have to deal with all that nonsense.

Because the federal tax incentives are going down and eventually being eliminated, I’d say more is lost by indecision than wrong decision.

Financially, you’re better off getting a bigger system today than a smaller system in January. 

Overall...

Given you’re in Texas and don’t have net metering and that isn’t happening without massive changes in your state’s leadership...

I’d get a bigger system than you need to account for 2 electric cars and probably one battery.  The battery would mostly just be there to reduce your energy prices during peak hours.  

If you want to go multiple batteries, then screw it, get a much bigger system and go off-grid.  Then, get a generator to help your system if it needs it and only charge at charging stations as charging at home would drain your batteries.",nramos33,156725.0,0.9974,False,False,False,156725.0,3925,False

TeslaMotors,complaint,aarrqx,ecuz20p,t3_aarrqx,"I used to charge with the 110V outlet before we installed our 14-50. During the summer it got 4mph of charge consistently. Once winter hits, that drops to 0mph because the 110V outlet can't supply enough power even to heat up the battery to a chargeable state. We knew this in advance, having been warned by many others, which is why we installed the 14-50.

However, the 110V outlet isn't completely useless in the winter. Even at 0mph of charge, it will heat up your battery at least partially, which is something that the car would otherwise have to drain its own battery in order to do. Your car will be more driveable with the increased regen capability that comes from a warmer battery, and easier to charge if the next charger doesn't doesn't have to burn energy heating up your battery.

Driving from Toronto to Boston in the winter, we charged at Buffalo, Rochester, Utica, Guilderland, and Springfield. 220 miles of winter range can bridge those segments easily. In fact, charging so often is actually overkill. We never encountered a full or broken supercharger, but if so, in each case we would have had enough battery to get to the next one.

I will say that things like Android Auto are artifacts of how resistant the traditional automakers have been in regards to embracing software. Relying on Auto or CarPlay is in effect saying, ""We are a car company, not a software company."" Autos have resisted software for the same reasons that Tesla has to work so hard: making cars is hard and expensive. Compared to other industries, the automotive industry doesn't see a ton of new disruptive entrants, so they have stubbornly competed on terms they all have settled into. A little more HP, a little better mileage, some new sheet metal every few years, an occasional new gadget, some extra luxury. Outsource the components, just be the overall designer and assembler.

But, like all other industries, software is inexorably taking over cars just like it's taken over aircraft design (no one uses wind tunnels any more), financial services, farming, the biological sciences, and pretty much every industry. If it's not obvious now, it will be very soon: the most strategic and valuable part of any future car will be the software.

TeslaMotors,complaint,hyykxw,fzftekh,t3_hyykxw,"Here's the latest edition of the Range Post, because I think the information may be helpful to you.

**THE PROBLEM**

The displayed range on the screen may not be what you expect and it may not have much bearing on the actual driving range of your vehicle. It also might not be consistent with what you've seen in the past or what Tesla advertised.

**THREE DIFFERENT RANGE MEASUREMENTS**

There are three different ways Tesla vehicles report range:

- **Regulatory (EPA/NEDC) Range**: The regulatory range is based on government testing in a test cell, not real life. A car's regulatory mileage numbers are only exactly accurate under very specific test conditions. This calculated figure probably doesn't reflect how you actually use the vehicle. Your Tesla may not get the regulatory range for all the same reasons that gasoline-powered cars do not exactly get their regulatory fuel economy. *This is the number Tesla (and other EV manufacturers) report on their website because the law requires them to.*

- **Rated (Displayed) Range**: The Rated Range is a range number based on a factory-set baseline watt hours per mile or km (wh/mi) and a measurement of the average battery module voltage. This is the number you see on the screen or in the app if you have your range display set to distance. It's Tesla's estimate of how far your car can go under what *they* consider to be average conditions. The *actual* wh/mi that you experience will vary based on battery temperature, variations in voltage between battery modules and cells, cruising speed, driving style, wind, wheel size, tire pressure and use of climate control. Because of all those variables, this rated range number may not reflect your actual driving experience.

- **Actual (Energy App Estimated) Range**: This is the range displayed on the energy app in the car. It's based on *your actual use*, in wh/mi, over the last 30 miles if you have it set that way. This is the most accurate estimate because it factors in your specific driving variables and other factors like the weather you have been driving in. It is updated as you drive and *this is the figure the navigation system uses to recommend charging stops.*

These three numbers *will not match*, even on a brand new vehicle, and this is not an indication that there is something wrong.

**HOW TO ""FIX"" IT**

Imagine if your cell phone had a countdown timer showing the number of seconds until the phone dies. People would worry endlessly about why one day it started with a different number of seconds and what that could mean for the health of the phone. It would make people worry unnecessarily about something that isn't really a problem. Instead, your phone has a simple precentage indicator. It's simple and it gives you enough information without making you paranoid. Tesla thought of this, too.

I recommend you set your vehicle to display energy as a percentage. For the following reasons:

- You wouldn't drive any vehicle down to the last 1% fuel remaining, so tracking each mile missing or gained becomes overanalysis.

- If you're using the Rated Range as a kind of battery health indicator, it doesn't give enough information for that and is too prone to error anyway. If there is a real problem with the battery pack, you'd get an error message from the BMS. 

- Most experienced Tesla owners set the display to percentage and if they need to check the miles remaining they use the Energy app in the car. This is the most accurate tool we have because it actually accounts for your real-world driving habits.

For day-to-day local commuting, just plug it in at home every night and charge to 80 or 90%. If you can't do that, use a public charger or supercharger when the battery gets at or below 20%. For trips that may consume 50% or more of your battery, use the nav system *even if you know how to get there.* It will monitor your energy consumption and let you know if and where you need to charge or if you'll need to slow down to conserve power. If you do this, even if your cars Rated Range varies as the BMS takes new measurements, the results will remain the same over time. 

The navigation system will warn you very insistently if you are leaving the range of a known charger. It is extremely difficult to accidentally strand yourself with a dead battery in a Tesla vehicle. You may hear tales of people arriving with a very *low* battery, but there are few stories of people *actually getting stranded* unless a supercharger is offline. The software and battery management system are *very* vigilant.

*Calibrating Your Battery/Battery Management System:* You may see suggestions about discharging your battery pack to <10% and then charging it to 100% to ""calibrate"" the system. Those techniques worked on old versions of the Model S battery pack from 2012 until about 2016. Those packs would get voltage discrepancies that would cause the range estimates to be more like wild guesses. After 2016, the battery pack and the sofware had matured to a point that this treatment was no longer necessary and Sandy Munro noted that Tesla is now balacing the cells to within one milivolt of each other in the Model 3. You can try this technique if you like, but it almost never actually works.

**YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW ...**

It's possible to get near or even exceed the Regulatory Range in a Tesla vehicle. Keep the windows closed and use the climate control sparingly. Ideally, pre-heat or pre-cool the car while it's plugged in so you're not using battery energy to heat or cool the cabin from an extreme temperature. You'll also need to drive no more than 5 or 10 mph over the posted speeed limit. Accelerate slowly and use regenerative braking, which is easier to do if you set the car to 'Chill' acceleration mode and regenerative braking to 'Standard.' Using Autopilot or TACC can also help because it tends to be more moderate on the acceleration and braking than most human drivers. Operated very efficiently, a Tesla vehicle can almost always live up to its promises.

Batteries to degrade over time. You can expect to lose around 5% of your total capacity in the first two years and another five percent over the following 5 - 8 years. Some batteries lose it quicker than others, but few lose more than 10% over the course of their lifespan. Storing the vehicle at a very high (>90%) or very low (<10%) state of charge for long periods of time can exacerbate the losses, but even that is not very significant over the long term. You should not hesitate to charge to 100% when you will actually need it. If you're fixated on the Rated Range display, you might think you have much higher or lower degradation than expected, but there is a very high liklihood that your *actual driving range* will follow the expected degradation curve. According to Tesla, the vehicle is within specifications if it has lost less than 30% of its Rated Range.

Note: The Model S and Model X have a ""Range Mode"" that limits the maximum energy consumption of the climate control system, but it's unclear how much it really helps. The Model 3 and Model Y do not have this option.

**IF THAT STILL DOESN'T WORK FOR YOU ...**

If, after all this, you think you have a problem with your battery pack then you should immediately contact Tesla in the interest of the safety and reliability of your vehicle. We redditors have a lot to say, but we cannot fix your car. If you're trying to find out if anyone else has experienced an issue similar to yours, try the Search function. Range is discussed *very* frequently.

**TL;DR**: Don't fixate on the Rated Range display; it's often wrong. If you need to see a range number, use the the Energy App. There is probably nothing wrong with your car and you'll be a much happier owner if you set the range display to percent and just drive until it's time to charge. If you still think there's something wrong with your car, you need Tesla, not Reddit.

TeslaMotors,complaint,hyykxw,fzfxmlf,t3_hyykxw,"This has not been my experience.  I'm also in at 2018 Model 3 AWD at 478 km remaining on a 100% charge (72.6 kWh nominal full capacity per the CAN bus).  [Here's a plot](https://imgur.com/3yJAXsb) of a 300 km drive I did last week where I took my car from 100% to 18% then recharged to 70%.  The relationship between SOC and range remaining is perfectly linear.

Both range and SOC are rounded to the nearest integer in the GUI, so with the respective rounding errors each % can cover about 5 km of displayed range.  50/478 = 10.46% which rounds to 10%, but 46/478 = 9.62% and that also rounds to 10%.  246/478 = 51.46% which rounds to 51% - it's possible it changed in between you switching display units?

Having looked at both CAN bus and API data simultaneously, the underlying calculations for range on Model 3 are as follows:

* Nominal Full kWh is estimated by the BMS by measuring the current flow (amp-hours) during a large charge/discharge which had been preceded and is followed by a rest period.  This way the pack voltage is settled and it considers the reading accurate.
* Buffer = Nominal Full kWh x 4.5%, then rounded to 0.1
* SoC is determined based on a known voltage curve of the battery
* SoC = (Estimated Remaining kWh - Buffer kWh) / (Nominal Full kWh - Buffer kWh)
* Range Remaining = (Estimated Remaining kWh - Buffer kWh) x 145.37 Wh/km (EPA constant for 2018 Model 3 AWD/P3D)

This puts a 100% healthy nominal full pack capacity to be ~75.95 kWh and a nominal usable capacity of ~72.5 kWh, though packs come from the factory slightly over-provisioned and values are clamped at 100% until they eventually fall below.

The calibration technique of discharging to 5% then recharging to 100% does work, but only if your BMS estimate of pack capacity was miscalibrated to begin with.  With your pack having recently dropped to 478 km it's likely your pack recently recalibrated itself to be more accurate, and a further attempt so quickly afterwards either resulted in no change or wasn't counted because of insufficient rest period before & after charging.  In my experience the BMS will also recalibrate at lesser percentage changes (20-50%, 50-80% for example), though the final result may not be as precise.

2018 AWDs did not receive a retroactive range bump as far as I can tell.

MobilEye’s patent prevents non-MobileEye Autopilot from reading a traffic sign, then acting upon that sign.  However, your hypothesis is that Autopilot in *one* car reads the sign, then *other* vehicles act upon that sign when they come to the same place.  Since most traffic signs are nearly permanent, this would work for the majority of signs.  

Signs that have changed for one reason or another (construction, new speed limit, intersection changes, etc.) would be a problem for doing that alone, so they might use the camera to see that there is *not* a sign, then act upon *that*.  I don’t see how MobilEye’s patent can prevent that.

Maybe (hopefully) coming when lane keeping is added.

>TACC: The ""overtake accelleration"" should not come into effect if the faster lane has nobody anywhere behind you.

For whatever reason, the car has no rear-facing radar. It can't actually tell if a car is approaching you. This has been really concerning to me, because its possible that the car can make a lane change into a lane that is currently unoccupied, but with a car approaching very quickly, which could lead to a rear ending or side swipe.

Issues:
 Charge port freezing and locking the cable.  Solution was to use a hair dryer for 5~ mins pointed at the charge port until whatever was frozen melted.  Eventually mobile service came and replaced something in the charge port that seems to have fixed the issue entirely.  I expect any new models have this new part.  

 Windows and doors freezing after an overnight snow/freezing rain.  This was an easy fix; just ran the heater at max for 30~ mins and everything opened easily.  Might have to give the door handles a little punch though to get through the ice.  

 Biggest deal: discovered that it’s basically mandatory to turn down regen braking with rwd m3.  I made a “snow” mode driver profile where it goes to chill mode and turns down the regen, it makes a dramatic difference (night and day) in ease of snow driving.  The regen being just on the rear wheels can be a nightmare when it is effectively braking with just the rear wheels.  Snow tires would also be a big improvement (that I have decided to invest in for this winter) this is with the 19in all seasons (rwd).

The more complex whatever you created is, the more iteration is required. This is a universal rule that applies to everything, including production lines.

Right now tesla has been iterating and improving their line for a little over a year. They are to the point where the line can produce 99%(made up number) of the cars to very high standards but the process fails somewhere 1% of the time. 

That means that if they built 5000 cars last week, 50 of them have problems. I haven't seen 50 post of people complaining. Through fast iteration and novel testing methods, they will bring the number of defects further down, but it will never, ever be zero. 

Manufacturers like Toyota , VW or Ford that have produced cars for decades and iterated their processes thousands of times haven't reach 0 defects either. And they never will.

Given the pressure to perform that Tesla is getting, and their rapid iteration processes, it is likely Tesla approaches quality levels similar to the best legacy manufacturers very soon. Tesla probably surpassed quality levels of the worst manufacturers.

Tesla is building many of its Supercharger stations 100 miles apart. You can see this on http://supercharge.info/ by turning the map rings on at 100 mile radius.

I suspect the #1 goal - or maybe #2 behind cost - is to achieve a very fast 100 mile charge at low SOC (30 mile buffer = 15% SOC on a 200 mile car).

Tesla's fastest-charging car today, the Model S 90D, requires approximately 18.3 minutes to add 100 miles starting at 30 miles of rated range remaining.

A 200 mile Model 3 (let's say 55 kWh) would have to be charged from 15% SOC to 65% SOC, or 27.5 kWh added to the car. If it can accept the full 180 kW charge (3.3C), this should take approximately 9.2 minutes, or half the time of the current S 90D.

Why so important? Simple .. faster hops from Supercharger to Supercharger increase the capacity (miles charged per pay per hour) of the Supercharger network. This means fewer chargers to support more cars .. and while peak hours already see queues with the Model S in more popular locations, that number goes up dramatically if Tesla can scale up to selling 500k cars/year from 50k/year.

What does Tesla need to get here?  

1. Very efficient highway drive - the car must have very low drag (short / long / relatively narrow + good aero shape). 200 miles from 55 kWh = 275 Wh/mile highway. Tesla would probably like to reduce this farther; Model S 90D is around 300 Wh/mile (70 mph, 70F, 19"" wheels, AC off).
2. High-powered charging. Obviously!
3. Very efficient battery charging (to reduce heat build-up in the pack while supercharging .. bear in mind that batteries have a pretty high specific heat, so if heat buildup is low then a 9 minute charge cycle followed by a 90 minute discharge cycle (drive 100 miles) is probably tolerable.
4. Chemistry that can accept high charge rates. 3C is pretty high; most lithium formats don't like to be charged that quickly (lithium iron phosphate and lithium titanate exceptions). Tesla has full control over the chemistry for the Model 3 (probably partial control for Model S), so they can hopefully find the right balance of high energy density, low cost, high cycle life, efficient charge/discharge, and high charge/discharge power.",protomech,4690.0,0.977,False,False,False,4690.0,2302,False

* The newer cells will not allow better heat transmission because they are physically larger; the ratio of heat generating chemistry to cell surface area is larger. The cell chemistry itself may generate less heat but none of us here know such details. 

* NCA vs NCM cells: Just from a first principles perspective both manganese and aluminum have a +2 oxidation state. This means that whatever role they play in the cell chemistry the number of manganese atoms in a NCM cell must be equal to the number of aluminum atoms in a NCA cell. An aluminum atom has an atomic mass of 13 vs Mn at 25. Whatever cooling benefits switching chemistries may bring I doubt it will be worth the mass trade off.

It decelerates quite hard when you take your foot off the gas while at low speeds, too, even at the lower settings (though it's neat that you can change that). I'm used to a manual transmission where I put it into neutral though, so I could just be used to coasting instead of decelerating.

Experts have even compared and found that any Tesla with MCU1 will have it's MCU lose function within a span of 4 years and in highest cases 6 years. Basically a chip designed to fail at the amount of stress the Tesla gives these chips. The sluggishness of your Tesla shows the MCU is always running maxed out. I don't think anybody needs to explain what happens to a computer chip if it's running overclocked literally day and night non stop. Because Tesla's keep running even at night.

Any warranty upgrade you get, you'll still get a chip uncapable of your car either in the short term or a very short term. Lots of owners are asking for a MCU2 upgrade. I suggest you ask Tesla for a discount since your issue has not been resolved. Bonus, you'll get a 50 times faster working touch screen and all the new functions.

Really? I think it's gotten a LOT better, and I trust it's arrival time estimates. It's usually within two minutes if I follow its route. The only time it's nuts is when it forgets a turn. (See SR 434 to I-4 Westbound in Seminole County, FL) It maps the turn. You can see the blue line, but it thinks you've stayed on the same road, so it doesn't announce it. The turn that I mentioned is a 90-degree turn to an on-ramp with a traffic light, so it's not like it's subtle.

I have two coworkers who have purchased Teslas and don't want anyone to know about it. They live and work in a community that is not so affluent, and seem to feel bad about such a luxury purchase, and are worried what people will think about them if they learn what car they drive.

Now, clearly, that didn't stop them, but I completely get where they're coming from, and it's an interesting problem. I find this especially interesting because it means that they are actively avoiding the word-of-mouth marketing that Tesla excels at. The only I fix I see for this is to sell a cheaper, very basic model that helps change the image of the company. Some people just need a people mover, and it doesn't have to be fast and sporty.

Personally, I haven't bought one yet because that money is far more valuable for other purposes, and I'd like to buy a model that I want, rather than pick from the limited options available today. Plus, driving a Volt at the moment, there is almost no electric vs gas cost savings to be had for me. Buying a Tesla basically gets me OTA updates and autopilot(oh, and longer road trips). Those two things are not worth 40k to me unless the vehicle ticks some other boxes that my current car doesn't.

1. I like being higher up - 3 and S are too low. X is just too big. Y is hopefully going to be the Goldilocks size.
2. I've committed to no more debt. So I buy my cars in cash. Writing a $60k check for a AWD LR Y is a tough thing to do, once I've even saved up the money to be able to do so. Especially on a depreciating asset. I'd feel a lot better investing $40k and buying a 3yr old SUV for $20k.
3. I'm wanting to get a travel trailer. Which means I'd likely need a truck at some point. So Model Truck (or R1T) sounds decent.. but the range while pulling a big ass wind catcher behind me is going to be absolutely abysmal. At least a Tundra comes with 300mi range on one tank *while* pulling a trailer (eg: 30g tank @ 10mpg).
4. I feel like we're at 'iphone 2' of EVs and especially batteries. In 5-8yrs, I have a feeling 250mi range will be viewed as 'cute' cause the new stuff is 400-500mi on a charge.

* JAN 2017 I was at my local Tesla store and I was told that I could take an S for a test drive even if I had no intention to buy an S and I was in line for a 3.
* FEB 2017 I pick them up on the offer and scheduled a test drive. It was great, but I was not able to test drive the Autopilot since all the cars with Autopilot were busy with other customers, although I has expressed that I wanted to test drive the S only to check the autopilot.  No problem I was told that I could re-scheduled another test drive.
* APR 2017 I scheduled a second test drive only to be told that the test drives are only for people who are interested in purchasing a S or X; this is the same person who told me to reschedule.  Oh well. [read my post on this issues here](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/6b0olk/more_aggressive_sales_tactics_at_tesla/)
* JUN 2017 someone from headquarters calls me to see if I wanted to test drive an S, I tell him the whole story and he's on the defense a bit, doesn't deny nor confirm about the availability of test drives to people interested in the model 3 and the conversation is very awkward.  What's interesting is that he follows up via email as if we talked about me being interested in a model S and wanting a test drive (emails are on record with a CRM system, phones calls are not). I do nothing.
* This past week my buddy from my local Tesla stores emails me, the same one who in APR 2017 told me to reschedule the test drive and then denied me one (unless I was interested in a S r X).  In his emails he was offering me to test drive the S with the Autopilot.  I responding thanking him but reminding him that in no way I am interested in a S or X and I am waiting for the 3 to be available for test drive, and reminded him that he told me that the test drives for the S were reserved to people interested in the Mod S; and that therefore I was going to wait.  He replied saying that I was more than welcome to test drive an S and check the Autopilot feature, never mentioning anything about ""the past situation"". I decided to just leave it at that, and wait for the 3 to be available in the showroom and test drive it then, and I will do so at a different Tesla store.

I do believe that the sales channel of Tesla is under pressure to perform, to sell as many S/X as possible with the old school of selling:

The model 3 is no doubt wider than most domestic cars here but I wouldn’t say it’s any worse than all the Mercedes and Audi you see driving around the city. Regarding machine parking, I’ve never had any issues with “scraping” as you mention. The car has always fit fine and my work place has machine parking. 

Fortunately I don’t live in an apartment so I installed a wall connector myself, but I completely agree that if I couldn’t do that it would have been a hard sell. 

Regarding supercharging, I recently drove all the way down to Kyushu. You can make it all the way to Fukuoka using only super chargers which are almost all just a 5 min detour off the highway. After that though once your in Inaka you need to rely exclusively on Chademo chargers from Nissan which are almost everywhere including pretty much every parking stop on the highways. 

Overall me and my wife are extremely happy we went with Tesla. Agree it can be stressful on some of the more narrow roads but that would be the case with any foreign car EV or ICE.

While wide cars will not be for many in Japan you have to remember the success Toyota and other companies have had with cars of virtually the exact same width. These however tend to be SUVs and minivans such as the Alphard, RAV4, Harrier, although include some cars in the luxury sedan segment. Saying that, the Y being 2.5inch/7cm wider then the 3 may struggle to sell. There is also the Land Cruiser which has found success while still being 1970~1980mm in width, but this should probably be treated as an exception

The 1850mm limit is generally specific for mechanical parks. These accommodate for cars with a width of 1850mm and are in fact wider than this (but not enough to make parking super easy). Outside of the most central areas of each city which are easily accessible by public transport I don't think these parking lots are as common as you seem to be suggesting. Other parking lots you see out in public often have a rated limit of 1900mm which rarely seem to be enforced judging by how these often you will see a Land Cruiser parked.

Tesla hacker Green has found that zenrin has been integrated into the new firmware for Japan vehicles, but does not yet appear to be active.  Once active this should hopefully give details on road width making Tesla more viable in Japan. https://mobile.twitter.com/greentheonly/status/1424822434239336460

Tesla has had success in other parts of the world with narrow streets and where people typically live in apartment buildings (Hong Kong comes to mind). I think there are factors other than size which have influenced sales.  Word of mouth seems to has its limits in Japan making it difficult to sell without advertising. It is made worse by the semi-media blackout on Tesla (probably thanks to the likes of Toyota who lobby against EVs), concerns around the power grid (especially since Fukushima), and misinformation about EV on general.

If you have the necessary adapters you can still charge a Tesla in more locations than virtually any other EV in Japan. Electricity is virtually everywhere in Japan (vending machines at the top of hiking trails lol) giving room for various charging networks to expand. Also, the difference in price of the M3 LR over the SR+ seems to smaller relative most parts of the world.

I can't think of an environment better suited for the electric car actually. The lack of an engine and transmission in an EV opens up design options (can make them small). Also, building an electric infrastructure to support charging is much easier, than say hydrogen. 

Japan is the second largest importer of fuel, I would think the Japanese would be more excited to move away from fossil fuels than most countries for that reason alone.

I’ve road tripped to all 4 islands mentioned above, with much of the charging done on the silly CHAdeMO system with its bulky adapter and J1772 overnight charging. I drove to Hokkaido in the middle of winter for the Sapporo Snow Festival, and my rear-wheel-drive-only P85+, fitted with Michelin X-ICE tires performed beautifully. At that time, there were no Superchargers in Hokkaido and there were no highway CHAdeMO between Hakodate and Sapporo—quite the adventure. 

As for size, there are sacrifices to be made when driving my MS. I have to pick and choose roads and parking spots. Elon has said Tesla should be building compelling cars. If you want a smaller car, they’re available, but it takes a certain size to have the battery capacity (providing range) and safety features we’ve come to expect. 

A couple of nits to pick with OP’s OP. The #2 island has 2 Superchargers (not 3), and the second one came only recently. I can’t for the life of me understand why Tesla chose Kumamoto for the second one. Tosu should have one for its location in the middle of the island.

Sold/bought a home, sold cars, bought cars... it was a while.  I finally pulled the trigger on a $76,700 (excluding taxes) Model 3 and paid **$8k** for EAP and FSD.  Took delivery late 2018.  Needless to say, I was actually shocked they sent refunds for the Performance folks.   I doubt another manufacturer would do the same.  I am not asking for any refund...

My car has depreciated, sure.  But when I bought the car, to me that price was worth it, even *knowing* that Tesla makes changes at any point in time.  They have an inherent disadvantage because they make changes on the production line and people don't wait for 'the next model year'.

If I got nothing else from them, I still love and paid for the car I got.  Some people don't get that, some do... and I'm one that waited years.  Does it sting, maybe, it depends, but I do know that historically Tesla has tried to make it right when they never had any obligation to.  They've always tried to do the right thing way back in the 75kWh > software-limited 60kWh days.

I think the overwhelming response is because Tesla has not defined what their 'line in the sand' will be.  They need to define that, because as the owners grow, the backlash will grow too.  Not sure what else to say on it other than people are beggars and you should just enjoy the car you paid for...  I wouldn't expect another manufacturer to give me money for depreciation as soon as I drove it off the lot or if the next model came sooner and my model price dropped.

Existing customers being disappointed in the price drops is an understandable reaction, but Tesla isn't screwing you and I'll attempt to explain why, it is just an unavoidable chain of events.

Telsa could have done things slightly better, but I think this transition was always challenging for them.

I agree in not attacking other posters, but that extends to attacking the company,  more specifically if you are going to attack reflect on the big picture and why things are happening.

Old Tesla\_

* Low volumes of Model S/X produced inefficiently
* imported cells
* free supercharging
* referral program
* stores and high SG&A expense with barely adequate servicing
* Ramp on GF1 and Model 3 production in progresses,
* FSD more of a concept than a product, EAP devised as a product that could be sold ... (boundaries probably wrong)

Under the ""Old Tesla"" model Model S/X prices had to be high, even with those high prices, Tesla wasn't profitable.

New Tesla:-

* Around 7K Model 3s per week in addition to streamlined (or to be streamlined) Model S/X production.
* GF1 makes cells and packs for Model 3 (and I think soon for Model S/X)
* Paid Supercharging
* No referral program
* Stores, sales and delivery  overheads reduced, hopefully service is being ramped up.
* 35K Model 3 which limits prices  and margins on higher trims (new pricing very good)
* In turn Model 3 prices put pressure on Model S/X prices and margins (Tesla can't afford to make cars which sit in inventory)
* FSD closer to happening, a clear path has been defined, new product boundaries are a good thing.

For Q1 2019 margins on Model S/X are taking a hit, IMO cars are being sold at the new price, even though all efficency gains are a work in progress.

Most of us would rather buy a lower priced car from New Tesla, but there is no path to New Tesla which did not go through Old Tesla.

I'm happy for customers to vent and I think some compensation is warranted, the mix is not about right and people should move on.

Customers should reflect on the fact that they would be very happy to buy their current car at today's prices, so overall the company and the mission is making great progress even though these price drops are like hitting a very large pothole.

Yes, you have had a bit of pain, Tesla management and employees have had their share of pain, no one has had it easy, sometimes progress is hard.",M3FanOZ,24099.0,0.9903,False,False,False,24099.0,2469,False

The flood of Model 3’s being produced now will be a flood of affordable used EV’s in a few years. There’s also EV’s from Audi, Porsche and Mercedes coming out this year, the i-Pace from Jaguar last year, and all the upcoming VAG MEB-based cars, the Audi e-tron Fastback and GT, plus upcoming offerings from Rivian, Hyundai and KIA, and Renault and Nissan. A used Tesla will be competing against a new car. 

Competition, mass production and battery advancements will drive new prices down for similar range vehicles and increase range for similarly priced vehicles. Used car prices have to be low enough to compete with new cars. IMO Tesla’s recent price change was a correction, but don’t expect the current price/mile of range to be set in stone.

\- The Audi Etron looks to  be the size of a Q5 which is a 45k car but will cost near 80k in its EV form. Initially it will sell, but the range for a 95kw battery seems lackluster compared to a Tesla and don't think it will be a high volume seller. Nothing ground breaking and price is high compared to equivalent ICE.

\- The Mercedes EV does not seem to have great range either, low 200s and no extensive charging infrastructure. If it is priced near their GLC-GLE class then it will be successful, but if its 80k+ it will remain a low volume seller.

\- The Jaguar Ipace cant compete with the Model S or X as its smaller and seems more similar to the Model 3 in terms of dimensions. If its discounted and has good lease rates it can be a good alternative to a Tesla Model 3 for those who want a EV from a traditional luxury company and don't care about autopilot.

\- The Porsche Taycan is the one I am most interested in. Porsche generally delivers up to its expectations of being a drivers car.

Starting price is supposed to be under the Panamera and starting at 75K, however it will balloon up with options.

The Model 3 *needs* a lot more processing power because it has to do *everything on the single processor.* The Model S/X run the navigation routing and voice recognition on the Instrument Cluster (IC) computer, dividing the workload. While these processors are old, you have to take into account the fact that they aren't being asked to do anything substantial. *How much processing power do you need to play streaming music and display a map?*

>The Model S is not more premium than the Model 3 because there is no difference between the Model S and Model 3 gross margins.

Gross margin does not make a product more or less ""premium."" The Model 3 you are seeing now is the most luxurious version of that car that they will be building. If you are happy with that, then it's good for you. If you want more wood grain and more aluminum accents, you're going to have to upgrade.

>Model 3 steering wheel has scroll buttons that with extra functions.

You can assign what the scroll wheels do on the Model S while you drive as well as use them to summon various vehicle data to the IC screen.

>Horizontal 15"" screen vs vertical 17"" screen. It is unclear which one is better.

Tesla has stated that their premium cars will be using the portrait 17"" screen and their other cars will use the 15"" landscape screen. The Roadster 2 has a 17"" portrait screen.

>Model S door handles extend but they also break down frequently and cost $850 each to replace out of warranty.

What percentage of door handles break down and how often do they break down? Do you have a reasonable, non-anecdotal statistical basis for this assertion? I've owned two Model S's over the past 2 1/2 years. I've never had a door handle mishap on either of two cars. Does that make me a statistical outlier?

So if they make 200k model 3s in 2018, then there will only be 400k people ahead.

Considering they need to raise money to take production from 5K a week to 10k a week, then maybe we can get it by the end of 2019. But that is only if they raise capital shortly and increase capacity to schedule, which for Tesla is unlikely.

Overall if I order a model s or x now I can get it reasonably soon. If I order a model 3 I will be in for a very long wait.

Regardless of the features found on the 3, the S is available.

Their is a lot of speculation about a refresh on the S, we would expect the S will standout in it class. 

I would disagree about the battery degradation of the 3 vs a 100D as the normal discharge currents per cell on the 100d would be lower.

The S and x have a better temperature management system on the batteries, where as the 3 uses a cost optimised solution.

Storage on the s is better

The S can tow

The S has many wiz bang features door etc.

The s has better door handles

The S back windows open wider

 * First off, it is far safer as your foot is over the brake pedal which reduces response time in the case of an emergency.  
 * Second, it can all be done in software.  
 * Third it can completely mask the dreaded lack of regeneration we get when the pack is cold. The difference in driving dynamics can be severe  
 * Easier hyper mile driving, the ability to glide with ease without any loss of speed until you feather the brake/regen

A) Despite many members' refusal to believe it, people base car purchasing decisions on more than range and 0-60 times. I don't understand why that's so impossible for many on here to comprehend. Preferences that don't exactly match yours aren't invalid. The E-tron might turn out to be a better car for a lot of people, despite being slightly less efficient. The focus on price is silly too. ""Why would anybody buy an Aventador? It's like $200k more expensive than a Prius and gets way worse mileage!!!"" 

&#x200B;

B) People have become used to Tesla making insane (and insanely cool) products. Each thing that Tesla released represented either a huge step forward for the company or an application of technology that hasn't been cobbled together in that way yet. The Model S was a performance car that was electric and not some piss-ant little Nissan Leaf. It was a cool car to drive and to be seen in. The Model X was the same, only it sat 7 people so it was a way to have a Minivan without looking like such a mom/dad. The Model 3 carried the same tech over but with a much lower pricepoint, making the vision of an affordable, legitimately usable EV for the masses look within reach. The Semi brought the same tech to a huge and vital industry in a way that nobody has quite yet done (including Tesla, but the thought is compelling). 

&#x200B;

The Model Y? Well, it didn't really do or show any ""new"" thing. It's just a taller Model 3. That's literally all it is. I don't buy the 7 seat thing, they'll be like the rear seats in a hypercar. Useful for a doll maybe. Other than that, what does it do exactly that's groundbreaking or particularly compelling? It's a taller Model 3. It exists to appease people that don't want a regular car, don't want an SUV or truck, but rather a vehicle that gives you the advantages of neither and the disadvantages of both. I guess it lets you sit a little higher to feel more important on the road. That describes the bulk of the crossover/mini-SUV segment. I don't know why it's so popular but it is, so Tesla made a car to fit into that category. A car that (like basically every other crossover) is pretty unremarkable from a bird's-eye view and add's nothing novel besides being a little bit taller. Because that's what it is: a taller Model 3.

&#x200B;

So yeah, it's not a particularly exciting launch. It's a good thing for Tesla (if they can avoid the delivery/service/ramp issues of years past) because it lets them break into a new market segment. That's very good and practical but it's not particularly exciting, and we're used to being excited by Tesla reveals. Hence the disappointment.

Ever since then, I have tried to convince people in my company that we need to retrofit stations at some of our older communities. I have gotten quotes and proposals to install more ChargePoint stations or even simple clipper creeks or tesla wall connectors for residents.  it always comes down to money. I’m not very good with financing and accounting and so I have a hard time coming up with a return on investment for if we were to charge people money to plug-in.  personally, I would like to just offer charge stations for free.

MUD charging challenges can be overwhelming if you ask EV enthusiasts or experts. Challenges include high upfront capital costs for the charging stations, the lack of awareness about EV technology, siting issues, installation costs related to these units and billing challenges as you begin to scale at residential buildings.

I'm up to 14k miles on my Sep '19 Model 3 SR+ in the UK.

The one thing I would change is the rear opening. I can get my road bike in, but have to take the front wheel off and it's a tight fit even then. I've got back seats covers so my German Shepherd can come on adventures.

I've had 2 BMW 3 Series both with the fastback tailgate which were great for moving stuff.

I love the 3, but will probably trade for a Y when they are available in the UK.

The SR+ is easily enough performance for even really spirited driving. In my ICE cars I've always felt slightly bad unleashing the power knowing how much wear it puts on the powertrain. No concerns about letting the electrons fly.  With a 50 mile commute each way I was expecting  to log 30K miles until this lockdown happened. Do check your range requirements.

* only the SR and SR+ trims are eligible for the federal rebate; the LR AWD (what we have) is not;
* we live in a rental apartment too; we're fine with just a normal power outlet (~ 1 kW, 6–8 km per hour of charging) but it'll depend on the distance you need for your wife;
* pain points: delivery service remains lackluster and requires you to be on top of the delivery advisor to make sure you get it on time; you do lose 25% of your EPA/summer range;
* generally speaking, you shouldn't spend more than 10-20% of your household gross income on a car though; our LR AWD with FSD (color options came free) came to just under $1200/month, after a $10k downpayment; if you really want a Model 3, a fair compromise to keep the costs down would be a SR+ without FSD (eligible to rebate and lower overall cost) and with a healthy downpayment;
* consider buying/accepting delivery at the end of a quiet quarter to maybe get some freebies (white interior, non-white exterior paint);
* house vs. car, that is really a personal utility-function question; for us who are saving for a house in TO, we got the car because my partner really wanted a Tesla since forever and the monthly costs were still fiscally reasonable; at the end, it is just $10k of savings for the down-payment and an extra $600/month extra (we had a 2017 Chevy Volt Premier before).

Generally speaking, cars with a wide track and scalloped body come from factory with some kind of pre-applied PPF to mitigate this. Usually a strategically placed piece less than a foot square & that probably only cost 50c at volume price.

Range: Speed is the worst thing for these cars in regards to range. The faster you go, the lower your range. I’ve found in my Model 3 the sweet spot is 60-65 MPH. Which is fast enough for me going down I-10. Climate control can also be a huge drain in the winter. Use seat heaters more than cabin heat. 

Autopilot: Your phantom brake slam was, and I’m guessing here, a speed limit problem. One section of I-10 west in Brookshire is a 65 MPH zone and when you pass the Brookshire offramp, the car slams on the brakes and shows 50 as the speed limit. Just keep your foot near the go pedal and be ready to accelerate if needed. AP will not disengage if you feather the throttle as needed. 

Doors: I 100% agree. To the point where I’ve ordered the stickers from amazon to apply to the button so people know that opens the door. 

Console: A wrap is definitely required to help keep the console clean. But I don’t find the center console impossible to keep closed or even remotely close to hard to close. Your mileage may vary I suppose. 

Steering stiffness: Go into settings and change the setting? There’s three after all.

Second big thing for me is Android Auto.  I actually use it every day, and as much as the Model 3's screen is amazing, not being able to have that integration sucks.  Tesla truly does remind me of Apple from a few years ago.  They want you to not have choice.  They know best, and having choice is wrong for the user.  

Third thing is that the Bolt actually DOES have more interior passenger room than the Model 3.  I couldn't get our rear facing child seat in the seat behind the driver with the driver seat in the correct position.  I can in the Bolt.   There's no difference in width in the rear seat between the two, but there is more combined legroom in the Bolt between the front and rear seats, which I was shocked by.

Other little things I prefer, having a heated steering wheel in the Bolt.  Having two rear view cameras in the Bolt, one being integrated into the rearview mirror with the push of a button.  The surround view, top down camera when backing into spaces or parallel parking is also extremely cool and useful in the Bolt.

But the things I thought I would absolutely love, like the glass roof and the ""open"" feel of the cabin were nullified for me by how dark the tint is on the roof.  I absolutely hated how dark it felt inside the Model 3 versus what my expectation had been.  And the autopilot did not feel ready for prime time.  I'd experienced AP1 in a Model S that my neighbor let me borrow a few years ago and commute to work in.  The AP2 in the Model 3 doesn't feel quite as good.  It moves around way too much in the lane, and had way too many close calls where I had to take over.  If I'm going to drive one in traffic, I'd choose the Bolt right now because of the one pedal driving.

The Model 3 is an amazing drivers' car.  But it's also a $55k car as configured.  It handles so damn well and just feels so planted and controlled. The Bolt by comparison feels dangerous but fun.  There's so much torque on the Bolt that it feels out of control sometimes when you push it, but to me that gets my heart rate up and makes it actually feel more fun to drive in certain situations.  I think the Bolt would actually be better for autocrossing.   ",[deleted],-1.0,0.9955,False,True,False,-1.0,3220,False

Even with the rumored solar panel option on the CT, which may give you a few miles a day or so, it won't be enough to confidently go exploring that far away from the grid.

But watching various test drive videos, where it showed the motion of the truck going over bumps, and gave a sense of scale when people were getting in and out, changed my sense of the shape.  I feel that the negative reactions are from disappointment that it didn't match the vision people had created in ***their*** heads. One part of the sales numbers for pickup trucks is the flexibility to do various things. Run it as is and put stuff in the back. Put a topper on it. Put a ""roof"" rack on, and carry kayaks, or ladders, or whatever up their, put a camper body on it....... The cybertruck cannot (easily) do most of that. But what it can do, it does much better. It's success, or failure, will come down to whether it gains enough of that enormous market to make a profit. I think it will sell well enough, that simplicity of manufacture means good margins, the base price indicates that, why else would Elon set the base price $10,000 lower than he had previously mentioned?

The various modified renders, Will. Not. Happen.  Not on this version anyway.

They just had too many people distractedly running around to actually handle my sale with any continuity and I think everyone involved thought someone else had explained it.

Luckily I am in a position financially that putting the extra money down on the car wasn’t going to break the bank. Also luckily I am understanding and didn’t choose to go to war over the issue.

The reality here is that this is a company whose processes (such that they exist) are completely insufficient, inconsistent, and constantly in flux. I get the sense that everything is changing for these people every day.

The whole concept of selling an in-stock vehicle to a walk-in customer is totally foreign to their previous way of doing business, but they need to get with the program ASAP if they plan on growing as fast as they need to.

What other dealer in town requires you to put down $2500 just to “reserve” a vehicle in the lot — before you even do your finance paperwork???!!! Tesla can not afford to vaporize customer good will as their demand increasingly penetrates a mainstream market with mainstream consumer wants, needs, and expectations.

It’s great that they are selling a ton of M3s, and I can plainly see that the demand is growing in my little slice of the market, but if they don’t get their act together I could easily see them derailing that.",alexmarkley,882.0,0.9272,False,False,False,882.0,2193,False

&#x200B;

Ordered a White TM3. My delivery was scheduled for a Saturday. I get a call the day before pick up that my car was not going into drive and either I could wait 3 weeks while they tried to diagnose the car or they could find me a new VIN. Of course I told them to get me a new VIN since I didn't want a car that was having issues before delivery.

They find me a new VIN and say it would take about half a week for the car to be in the delivery center. They gave me a loaner for until that day (I super appreciated that). A day before I am to pick up my new VIN, they call me again and said they just realized the car already had 1000 miles on it. How do you only see this the evening before delivery? Anyhow, he says they will get me a price adjustment and kind of overestimates how much he can get me.

I was so tired of this by then I said okay and picked up my 'new' car with 1058 miles on it. It just pissed me off that if I wanted a inventory car, I would have asked for one but I wanted to just go home with the car since I had taken the day off. After pickup, it was missing (basic) AP and I only realized it when I was driving it home and the car got too close to the car in front of me because it was also missing TACC (the loaner had got me into the habit of using basic AP). I had to call them again and they pushed it out that night for me. I also found out it didn't have HW3 because it was manufactured before the cutoff date but since I don't have FSD, that didn't annoy me too much.

At the end, I got a \~800 price adjusment, a HPWC, and I had them throw in a keyfob too, so that honestly did make up for it but I wouldn't have asked for anything if I had just gotten what I was expecting in the first place.",sikhcoder,9185.0,0.4395,False,False,False,9185.0,1751,False

As a new owner whose had a Honda and Scion, and parents who own a 12 year old Lexus, there’s no beating around the bush that my ~180xx VIN Model 3 when sitting next to them has poorer exterior build quality - specifically panel sizing and alignment. This isn’t a unique problem to Tesla. I have a friend with a Mercedes E class whose hood looks like it had a few inches chipped off. Tesla however seems to have (or have had) more persistent misaligned builds. My buddy’s CPO P85 has gaps between the doors so big I could stick my finger in them.

Interior however for my 3 is stunning and well put together. I’d put it on par with Lexus build quality.

Even though I've written-up wrecks for 25 years, and know what I'm doing, and own (and have even been in a crash with) my own Model 3, my Tesla estimates often balloon by 100% once the cars are in the shop and taken apart for thorough inspection. They have a lot of repair requirements that are sort of ""Porsche-like"" in their thoroughness. 

Your mechanical damage alone was $10k since they require replacement of every single steering and suspension part in such a hit, whereas with say, a Malibu, you might get away with 1/10 that cost.

The salvage resale values on Teslas are also still extremely high as well, so it takes much less of the percentage of vehicle value in damages to total a Tesla than other cars.

Good job going through your own insurance. Always do that when you have a policy that covers some form of ""replacement cost"" since your own policy pays-out more in that situation than what the other party is legally liable for. 

It's usually a good thing to go through your own policy even without replacement cost in a situation like this since you could easily run-up against the other driver's low policy limits with an expensive car and another person also making a claim against her for their damages.

In Massachusetts, California, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey you're legal if you're carrying a liability limit for property damage as low as $5k, and in New Hampshire and Virginia it's possible to legally drive around with no insurance at all.

The pluses:

- the unbelievable responsiveness to right foot inputs at any time and at any speed.

- the way the low center of gravity keeps cornering flat.

- the way the low moment of inertia makes the car eager to rotate to get around a corner.

- the fact that the car is virtually silent at full throttle means you can stomp on it at any time without drawing undue attention.

- charging at home means you start every day with a full tank without ever having to make a stop somewhere for fuel.

- the lack of maintenance - you don't even need to check the oil, let alone change it.

- the buying experience. 

- the app.

- the excellent practicality in terms of passenger and cargo space as well as all weather capability (with dual motor versions and appropriate winter tires).

The minuses:

- it's heavy, and the tires aren't really wide enough to get the most out of it, especially in the corners.

- the lack of an engine note. Not all ICE sports cars have a good one (my 911 Turbo's was non-existent, for example), but it is something that you miss if you're used to a good one.

- ""refueling"" on the road - the limitations on long distance traveling in terms of route selection, total lack of DCFC charging infrastructure in some areas, and the time it takes (this depends greatly on the kinds of places that host Superchargers in your area, as some host locations make for a much more 'painless' wait than others).

My previous car was an 06 mustang GT (manual of course) that I had a lot of fun with and got me through my college years. Had it tuned, cold air intake, racing headers, cat back exhaust (California), etc. I had been eyeing Tesla since they came out with the OG roadster. 

Sometime after I graduated I wanted a car that was a little more “professional” and “sophisticated” than a fire breathing V8 muscle car. I was looking around and finally test drive a Model 3 Performance. 

LIFE CHANGING. 

The torque, acceleration, handling, and fit an finish compared to a muscle car just took everything to a new level. 

I couldn’t afford a performance but kept my eye on all sources until I found a really good deal on Long Range Dual Motor (4wd was important to my decision - handling + power) that already had the FSD package and had to buy it. 

You can still mod the Tesla to a certain degree with suspension, wheels, or a “tune” if you are willing to risk it and have the right variation. Check out the Ghost Upgrade from ingenext if you have a 2018 with a “980” rear motor - probably going to pull the trigger on that fairly soon. It basically turns my Long Range into a Performance with some features of track mode.

For all the amazing positives of the Tesla including its awesome EAP, it was pretty obvious that we were having to wait around for it to charge, and the overall trip was noticeably longer than previous ones with cars running on gas.

A bigger battery or faster charging would certainly fix this problem, and our guess was that the bigger battery would be a more attainable goal in the near-term.  We, too, would be interested in such a vehicle.

Since it seems as though the highest rate of charge (100+kW, or \~100 miles in 15 minutes) happens when the battery is \~0% to \~50%, we found ourselves trying to get to the furthest Supercharging station possible and barely making it in order to achieve the fastest charging rate, which is really the opposite of what one should be doing when on a roadtrip...  ;)

1)Most smells (odors) are gasses, not particulates. A HEPA or ULPA filter will have no effect on odors. Carbon does remove some gasses for a short amount of time. 
Expecting a layer of carbon beads to make a difference in a single pass is unrealistic. 

2) Using a duct to contain the air to your anemometer may improve accuracy

3) Verify the fan power draw with each filter. The speed controller may be controlling airflow. The more restrictive the filter, the lower the power consumption of the fan motor. If the fan is set up to compensate for dirty filters, the power would increase with more restriction.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,73zzjb,dnuexfh,t3_73zzjb,"I'm confident that just the opposite will happen. I think that when competitors finally start to produce BEVs at scale, it will signal to the marlet that BEV technology is mature enough for the early majority of consumers to begin purchasing electric vehicles or else they will risk losing a lot of money on their new ICE. When these consumers make the leap from ICE to BEV, Tesla will stand out as the company with the most experience building BEVs and the company that caused the market to finally make the big shift to happen in the first place. Also at thiat point, the Model 3 will likely have a great reputation while other OEMs will only be starting to compete at scale. 

When people are adopting a new technology, they are going to want to pick the company with the better reputation that will guide them through all the rapid changes that will occur as the new technology disrupts the market. Tesla will stand out as the company to trust over the other companies that are only just responding to market demands. Just like we have seen time and time again with new technology adoption (search engines, social networks, streaming video, smartphones) the rising tide will lift all boats but disproportionately lift one company.

As for build quality. Its important to remember that cars are commodities. There will be less cars with considerabely higher advantages in quality when all of them have BEV power trains. More cars will become very fast and reliable and autonomous and these cars will become cheaper. The only real possibility for different quality is in the user interfaces and infotainment systems (which Tesla has an early lead on) or the interior, which will become less important as more cars become autonomous and ride sharing begins to get popular.

So in short, I think Tesla will be framed as a market leader when other OEMs begin to produce competitive BEVs at scale. After that happens, the real disruption of autonomous vehicles begins, and whoever can scale an autonomous network solution the fastest will have disproportionately higher market share and value.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,73zzjb,dnukxhz,t3_73zzjb,"Three points:
1) Your friend's point could be applied to just about anything new in life (i.e. don't buy anything new and disruptive or from not the largest player because it could fail). That approach misses the boat in a couple ways.  First, nothing would ever change if no one took a change with a new market entrant. Second, ignoring the disruptor and sticking with an incumbent is also risky in the fact that the incumbent faces significant issues in responding to the change and can quickly find itself in its own bad position. Remember that GM went bankrupt recently for not being nimble and VW has been in all sorts of trouble over its emissions cheating.

2) The automotive industry is not a zero sum game. Tesla will be a major player in EVs for at least a decade (which is about as long as most people own new cars) and that's if they do nothing more than only make the 3, S and X.  Electric car production (and more importantly, battery production) will be significantly constrained for decades as worldwide production transitions from ICE to electric. If other companies start to invest in production now, that is great, but it will only build out the market for EVs and provide more options... it shouldn't hurt Tesla sales for a long time.  If Tesla is able to grab 2-3% market share from each major player during the EV transition, they would be one of the largest auto companies in the world by the time all is said and done.

3) The Chevy Bolt proves that a large company does not automatically make a new car cheaper, better quality, have longer range, or safer.  That is complete nonsense. Teslas are leaders in safety, range and consumer rankings (look up best luxury sedan and luxury SUV on US News rankings... Tesla is #1). Building an EV is completely new to every major automaker right now, and the company with the most experience is Tesla, with Chevy and Nissan in second place.  It's unclear how being a larger company will fill in that experience gap.  As to quality, Tesla has made huge strides in improving that, and you can do research to compare them to other automakers.  In my view, the 3 should do a lot better in initial quality than other models because they are making this car easy to build and not including buggy stuff like falcon wing doors.",NoVA_traveler,106393.0,0.9812,False,False,False,106393.0,2284,False

The most expensive part of an EV is the battery, which gives Tesla the theoretical advantage of owning the largest battery plant in the world.

Also many people say Tesla is more of a tech company than an automotive one. These other companies don't fully understand tech,  OTA updates (or lack of) is just one example of this. 

Lastly, and this ties a bit into the last point, Elon Musk is almost ruthless about acquiring the best talent. He knows its the employees and their abilities that make the company successful.

Perhaps building great products is incredibly difficult.  It takes vision, leadership, driven employees, and a certain kind of corporate culture.  Innovative organizations are born in fire and forged over time.  

A legacy corporation, full of old engineers that don't want change, bogged down by miles of red tape, is like trying to race the titantic at LeMans.  Just saying ""ok everyone its time to innovate"" doesn't cut it.

I would applaud the rest of the industry if they could get their act together.  They are at least a decade behind, and only just now slowly waking up.  Let's be honest.. the legacy automakers are not good at innovation.  They are good at making the exact same product with slight tweaks for a century at a time.

\- Love the car, it keeps getting better via software

\- It's still completely fun to drive, and even though it's my first car payment in 15 years I don't mind.  (Super low interest rate) 

\- The car is versatile:  Finally installed the roof rack, looking forward to kayak/canoe season, oh and it did great even in heavy winter slush/snow. 

\- I've already saved hundreds of dollars of gas

&#x200B;

So given the above - I don't mind if the price went down or up from when I bought it - it was worth it to me at the time of purchase, and I know a year or two later you can always find a model cheaper.  That's not unusual for any car.  I paid about $44K for my 3D (black\*, aeros - which is what i wanted) after incentives - federal and PA state.   

&#x200B;

If I bought now it would be $43K.  Even though this is the most expensive car I've ever bought (I usually pay $15K for a used model) a 2-3% drop in price vs. the 6 months of having the advantages of a long range EV don't bother me at all.  

&#x200B;

Would I have waited for Model Y?   I debated this for a while.  The logic won out that 1.  Model Y is likely to be even more expensive, 2.  I assumed the price drops wouldn't be as drastic given the federal incentives are going away (and there's still $3750 in incentives to go, I doubt the Y price will drop before launch), and 3.  I can always add a tow hitch to the model 3 and use my small trailer to transport bigger things without renting a truck.   I just wish they made an official option for the tow hitch..     I'm glad to have the Model 3 for 2 years before the Model Y.

Specifically:

* early white cars had issues with the bumper color not matching. Tesla had the car blended to fix it

* early cars had an issue where the accent light strip below the daytime running lights would break off in their housing, which would cause a very difficult to see issue where that light strip no longer appeared illuminated. Fixed by mobile service in my driveway

* clunking noise from the front under some circumstances. There was a panel that was missing fasteners. Fixed under warranty, but has come back since the repaint and replacement of the aforementioned headlight. Really doesn't bother me enough to deal with

* early cars had issues with the back glass cracking over time. Replaced under warranty and I haven't seen that issue come up in almost a year now

* my car has some rattles from the back that I haven't nailed down yet. Only over very broken pavement. Also a rattle near the dashboard area, the 90k vin car has it too but I haven't seen many complaints about it, so I don't know if it's prevalent

2011 Nissan Altima coupe:

* passengers side vanity mirror lights stopped working at about 7k miles. Replaced under warranty

* drivers seat squeaked horribly. Seat replaced under warranty

* Rear parcel shelf rattled if a fly landed on the car. Never resolved and ended up being a factor in me getting rid of the car

2012 VW GTI Autobahn:

* front subframe bolts stretched over time (about every 1000 miles) causing the subframe to clunk against the body of the car. VW had a TSB for this in the Jetta but not the Golf (even though they're the same bolts and the same issue) and would not fix under warranty beyond tightening the bolts. Had to pay to have the TSB performed on the car which fixed it

* door panel rattles, never fully resolved

* body flex caused a felt seal at the top of the doors to creak badly, had to apply a special seal lubricant ever few weeks to prevent it

* drivers side B pillar had bad welds, which caused a separate creaking noise over undulations. Spent time in the body shop for that

* Drivers door was dented by the dealership and needed body work (noticed first night after bringing it home), dealership fixed it for free of course

2014 Chevy Silverado:

* seat frames and runners were Rusty, apparently this is normal

* several paint chips around the truck (this was a new truck with 75 miles on it when I bought it)

* rear window leaked, never had it fixed since it didn't cause any problems beyond some water runs on the glass from time to time

It's not an accurate comparison to compare a leased vehicle (for which you own $0 at the end of the lease period) with a financed vehicle (for which you retain some residual ownership at the end of the loan period).

If you bought a $55k Model 3 and got the full tax credit, the comparable monthly payment for 60 months is $833. This [article on depreciation](https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/cars/844807/Tesla-Model-3-depreciation-value-Mercedes-Audi) says it would lose 1/3 of value by 60k miles.

Full self drive is still an idea at this point, and I think the 2018 numbers are optimistic for a wide consumer release. The problem with full self drive is that it needs to cover better than 99.99% of driving, not 95% of it, especially if you are incapable of driving a car safely on your own.  At 95% complete you would expect something like 18 trips each year to require human intervention assuming one trip a day, which wouldn't be safe for you alone. 

It will come, and it will be faster than people who expect it to be here in 15 years, but I think Elon Musk is overselling what Tesla has right now. 

When it does happen, I think you should expect a car that can drive on local roads and highways safely, provided there are no construction zones and that the parking lots have been mapped. You will be limited to clear weather (no snow, rain, or fog) and it will have to be in well mapped areas(no rural driving) that have cell data coverage. 

TBH, the part about your plan that is ""stupid"" isn't the self drive part, you are just early on that. The ""stupid"" part is thinking that a new grad can afford a Model S. In most cases it would be financially irresponsible for a new grad to buy a Model S.

Let's generously assume you have more than say 5k saved.

The down payment for an auto loan is usually 10-20% where the higher the percentage you pay down the less money you pay in the long run.  Another thing to hold in mind is that the higher your APR (interest rate) is the larger of a down payment you should make. Seeing as you are fresh out of college don't expect anything below 7%.

20% of the $30,000 is $6000 dollars. Well let's say you get another $1000 dollars to make the down payment. Now it's time to figure out what you will be paying per month and for how long.

You will end up having to pay 24,000 dollars plus interest per month.  The average American time to pay off a car is about 5-6 years. Let's say you want to get it done in 5 years which means 60 months of payments.

$25,000 / 60 months = $400 per month +interest 

=$440 per month
This is how much your car would cost per month. Now add your rent, your food, your utilities, etc. 

You are looking at about 2500 dollars in fixed expenses. That is 30k a year gone. 

Let's say you miss some payments well there goes your credit and the young age you already are. You accumulate debt and you can't start saving for your future until your 30s when you finally paid that expensive car off you bought in your 20s.

I understand you have a visual disability but a huge purchase such as this at such a young age is going to give you a financial disability.

Full Self Driving (FSD) is currently $7,000 after the Autopilot upgrade. It includes the following:

Auto lane change, wherein the car will change lanes for you when you engage the turn signal.

Navigation on autopilot, wherein the car will navigate from interstate to interstate, and take the appropriate exits off the highways where necessary, where possible.  I add the ""Where possible"" disclaimer because in my area a interstate interchange has been updated and the exit is now a half mile sooner than where it was, now the car doesn't take the exit anymore.  It'll get fixed later, but a bit annoying at the moment.

Autonomous lane change while in navigation on autopilot.  This differs from auto lane change in that, if enabled, the car will autonomously change lanes in to adjacent lanes, as necessary, in order to try and maintain your speed. Furthermore, as you approach exits the car will change you jn to the appropriate lanes to take the exit, then take the exit.  So, in theory, the car will take you from on ramp to off ramp entirely on its own.

Summon, wherein the car will go back and forth up to 36ft.  This is mostly used for getting a car in and out of a garage.

Smart Summon, where in the car will come to you within 200ft.  This appears to have gotten nerfed a bit on HW3.0.

Autopark, wherein the car will perpendicularly, or parallel, park itself.  However, this feature is not commonly used because it requires two cars, or a curb, for the ultrasonics to ping off of, and pull the car in.  Furthermore, it's slower than if a human does the parking.  Additionally, it's been observed that the parallel parking feature has a tendency to rim rash every now and then.

And i believe that covers all the features.

Over time FSD will include stopping at red lights and stop signs, I believe we're about 2-3 months from that.  And I believe 6 months from now we'll have ""navigate on autopilot"" from main road to main road, wherein the driver needs to get to a striped main road, vs non striped residential streets.  Figure about a year before door to door.

At best.  Two years for door to door.. But we're getting there.

Another ""soon to be released"" FSD feature is reverse summon, wherein the car will go park itself.  Though, if it requires cars to ping off of I can assure you I won't be using it, because I never park near other cars

So, if you're going to buy it, ask yourself if you're going to use the features.  With the exception Autopark, I use all the features, though I'm going to be using Smart Summon less because it has become a tad unreliable after the HW3.0 retrofit.

* On its website and in their app (both free) select the type of car you will buy. 
* Then tinker with battery/charging settings: how full will you depart (100% SoC), how low when you want to charge (20%), how low do you want to arrive (depends. charger there = 10-20%, no charger = more) 
* how low speed, temperature, wind, dry/wet roads, weight and so on.

Then plan a route from A to B and you'll see what the optimal driving & charging strategy will be = where to charge and for how long (if at all).

Upfront: Yes, trips beyond the range take longer. Yes, rest of the year charging saves time.

Spoiler: weight is a marginal factor. Low temperature & speed are 90% of the ""problems"".

Forget EPA  range. It's only to compare EVs, not about usable range. It's a 100% to 0% relatively slow driving cycle on flat roads with a nice temperature. Don't run your battery to 0, that will harm it (and pushing it to a charger...)

EPA range is where calculations start......

* EPA vs. highway driving = -10% range
* Degradation (battery wear) = -3% range
* Usable range trip 1st leg = 100% to 20% = 80% of the battery available
* Usable range trip next legs (charge 80% to 100% takes too long) = 80% to 20% = 60% of the battery/range
* Cold weather = - 20 to - 30%

This means: on a bad day you have 50% of the EPA range.

Realistic highway range MY LR in nice weather:

* 100% -> 20% SoC at 70mph = 215 miles
* 80% -> 20% SoC at 70mph = 160 miles

TeslaMotors,would buy if,6zmlte,dmwwa1h,t3_6zmlte,"Looks like a reasonable assessment to me.  I've never been in the market for a BMW X5, but here are the points I'd add a little personal experience color on:
1.  I love my Model X.  Best car I've ever driven by far.

2.  Autopilot is phenomenal and makes highway driving vastly more pleasant.  I also believe that used properly (i.e. with the driver still paying attention and acting in a supervisory capacity) it significantly improves safety, because the Autopilot never falls asleep or gets distracted by an interesting bit of conversation/radio/whatever.  It can fail in other ways, but distractions are a huge cause of accidents, and if you step in to resume control when the Autopilot misreads a situation, the combination is likely much safer.

3.  You're spot on about the doors.  They look awesome, they produce lots of (to me) feel good ""Tesla moments"" (""wow, your car is awesome--do you mind if I take a video of the doors opening to show a friend?""), they're really cool... but they're also a lot more complicated than sliding doors with only marginal functionality improvements.  They're great when they have plenty of room on either the side or above, but if you're constrained in both directions (say, in a tight garage), they're a pain, even if they can still open fully with manual control.  And obviously you're much more likely to end up needing to bring them in to the shop than you are with more traditional doors, although we haven't had to.  (We have had some minor problems with them in winter when it was very cold (e.g. below 0 F), but nothing else.)

4.  To my mind, the helping put us on a pathway away from ICEs is the reason to buy.  The Model X is great--it drives great, I love the autopilot, it's quite comfortable (although I have no comparison set of how it compares to the comfort of a BMW)--but no way would it be worth the price but for the fact that it's electric.

5.  Re: supercharging/range anxiety/long distance travel:  It does require a little more planning for long-distance trips, but it's very doable.  We've driven to the East Coast and back to Michigan twice with our Model X.  The advantages of autopilot more than made up for having to stop at superchargers.  It's not nothing, especially if you're driving a lot many days in a row or trying to drive very long distances straight through, but it's very manageable.  And hey, free power on long-distance trips beats paying to fill up the gas tank multiple times any day of the week.  (I assume you'll get a referral code from someone to get the free Supercharging.)

6.  Minor point:  no oil changes is a nice little quality of life perk.  In general, there should be less routine maintenance on a Tesla than on a BMW, although that's dependent on Tesla quality control, which has historically been spotty but is supposed to be better than it once was.

Good luck with your decision.  I certainly encourage you to go with the Model X, but it does depend on what you prioritize.",CerebralPaladin,9066.0,0.9986,False,False,False,9066.0,2978,False

Even if we're assuming the battery and motors can do 1M miles, there's no way to actually use it for that long unless you're willing to keep fixing everything over the years (body, computer, etc). Most average people won't do this and the cost adds up.

Additionally, Tesla will roll out new improvement throughout the years (due to advancing tech and their need to grow their top line revenue) that even if they are small incremental improvements, it'll get substantial over the years and after 5 or 10 years (average Americans keep their cars for 6 years), you'll probably want to look at purchasing a new one.

She has lived in this little trailer in the woods of rural Arkansas on a small plot of land she bought 40 years ago. I have been trying to get her to move to the city where she is closer to services and family since she reached her mid 70s. I even offered to buy her a house if she would move but Nooooo she wants to remain there till she dies, stubborn old gal she is. We've notice her starting to get an early on-set of Alzheimer and she can no longer maintain her property. My last visit there proved it as I couldn't even find her driveway it was so grown over. I live in the PNW and my brother and his wife live far away too so its a journey for us to get up there and help her out but a few times a year.

Not a week into my refi and my mother spots a house in the city for sale that she fell in love with. Its walking distance to a senior center, grocery store, bank, etc. She proceeds to tell me if I buy it she would agree to live there. Shit, a promise is a promise.

Do not _ever_ get yourself into a bad financial situation for a luxury item. EVER. Seriously. You need to be able to put 20% down without worry, plus have the money for registration, taxes, fees, and whatever else you'll need. Which includes a way to charge the vehicle at home. I'm not one of those people that will tell you to never finance a vehicle, but when it comes to a luxury vehicle...eh...the more cash you have on hand the better.

You also need to be able to make the payments while saving money for life events. If you can't _easily_ afford to save 20% of your income, pay for the car, and pay for housing, then you're making a serious mistake.

Ok, having said that, if you actually _can_ afford the vehicle, then screw the haters. What you do with your money is your business. No job is ever guaranteed, but if everybody just worried about that nobody would ever buy a house, or a car of any cost, or have a credit card, or spend money on anything other than essentials.

You don't have to be a millionaire to get the car, but you do have to realize that you're going to be spending probably $12,000-$16,000 a year on car payments (again, MINIMUM of 20% down, 48-60 month term). And that's if you have good credit for a good interest rate. If $16,000 is a significant portion of your income, then you need to assess what your goals are over the next 5 years. If your goal is to have a paid off 5 year old car, then great! If your goal is to have a paid off car and a home of your own, and money in the bank, then it's time to figure out which is more important to you.

I was in a similar position as you, so I'll relay my thoughts.

**What I ended up doing:**

Bought a P3D-, which after taxes/registration/etc came to $60k.  I originally was going to just get a cheap car (Toyota Yaris, my old car, was most likely).  So I went over budget by about $40k....this made me feel irksome.

**Thought process:**

I started like you, wanting just the base model.  Then I decided, if I'm going to drive this for 5+ years, I should future proof it, right?  So I went AWD.  Then I found out about the Stealth Performance, so grabbed that.  ""It's just a few thousand more..."" I said.  Enhanced Autopilot?  Yea, lets throw that in because I know I'll want it some day!

**After purchase thoughts:**

I got a charger installed in-home.  I got a bunch of accessories (most suggested online).  Now I'm considering getting a ceramic coat to protect the paint.  As a note -- I have ***never*** given a crap about my car before except to make sure it runs well.  Washing, detailing, etc I never cared.  Now I do, because it was a ***lot*** of money.

I've been driving the car mostly for 3 weeks now.  A few days in the shop to fix some delivery issues (squeaky wheel that required a whole new drive shaft).  I love driving the car.  I want to go on road trips where before I didn't even want to drive to the store.  I love being in my car.

***However***, I'm about 95% sure I would have been happy with the base model.  Sure the interior would be worse, but I wouldn't be so crazy over keeping the car perfect.  The AWD was enticing at first, but from what I've read it only really comes in handy if you are in some ***serious*** trouble with getting stuck in snow or water.  Normal driving it doesn't matter.

**Relevant thoughts towards your decision:**

Buy the Tesla if you are in the position where you feel like you can ""treat yourself"".  If you are in a position where you are thinking of saving money and retiring, then go for the cheaper cars.  If you are truly set on the Mazda vs Tesla, get the base model SR+.  For equal cost cars, the Tesla is a superior experience.

You'll also likely save money on maintanence (no oil changes) and gas.  Can you trickle charge somewhere?  Relying on supercharging like it's a gas station isn't a good idea -- it will seriously degrade your battery.  See if your apartment has a place to charge.  Or your place of work.  But I'll let other renters comment here more as I did not need to worry about it.

*Investments:* I sold investments to buy mine.  The market is in one hell of a bull run, and my decision was kind of based off a presumption of a small downturn.  However, that wasn't enough for me to make the decision.  For me, it was talking to everyone I knew who said ""You never buy something for yourself, do it this one time"".  If that's you, then go for it. If not, then I would suggest remaining frugal.

***If I were in your position***: I would buy the cheapest new car possible.  Probably the 25k Mazda.  But, outside of the Tesla purchase, I'm aggressively frugal.  And I'm in a decent position where my past frugalness can bring me immediate joy.  Just ask yourself how much you drive, and how important the car is to your identity and daily life.

I think my question is academic per Electrek I'm pretty sure Tesla will honor the original price, but I actually tend to think of that ""honor the lower price"" thing as Tesla being awesome, not as a legal obligation.

Here's why: my cellular company has post-sales services I can buy, and every once in a while they change offering or change prices. Same with various products on the shelves at Best Buy or on Amazon. Perhaps a better analogy would be a digital app in Oculus VR's app-store: if an app was available for $10 when I bought my Oculus Rift, does that mean it would be ""false advertising"" if Oculus ever raised that price? Would Oculus be forced to always & forever honor the $10 price for that app? At least to those who saw the $10 price when they bought their Oculus Rift?

Again, please don't downvote me for asking: it's a valid question, IMO. *IF* companies have the legal right to raise the price of digital addons, then I think we should *applaud* Tesla for their (apparent! hopeful!) willingness to honor the original price for those who saw it. Obviously if Tesla has a legal obligation to honor that original price then no thanks is due - it is their duty and obligation. But if they have a choice, IMO we should be appreciative.

I took my aeros off (so lose ~5% right off the bat) and I drive faster than 65 on the freeway. This handy chart shows you your true range based on driving:

https://i.redd.it/fcd1127n4ut11.jpg

Also - you never want to get close to running out, so you plan your trip to give yourself some extra wiggle room, i.e. reaching your destination with ~30 miles left. Finally, you need to take into account the slight degradation that will happen overtime. Put it all together, and true comfortable range is more like:

310 (stated range) - 15 (5% degradation) - 15 (driving 70-75 on freeway) - 30 (wiggle room for reaching destination) = 250 miles.

Do that again for the mid-range RWD:

264 (stated range) - 13 (5% degradation) - 15 (driving 70-75 on freeway) - 30 (wiggle room for reaching destination) = 206 miles.

You have to consider these numbers, especially if you are making day trips where you don't want to worry about finding a charger at your destination in order to make it back home.

Outside of range - the AWD is much quicker and more fun to drive - I test drove a RW LR (similar acceleration to the mid-range RW) and definitely can tell the difference when driving. It is fun to have that extra acceleration. The RWD was quick, but the AWD was noticeably quick, fun quick you could say. I'm sure the P3D is even better, I almost wish I had one with that price drop...but o well.

IMO what you should do is figure out how many times you'll make trips where the LR can do it without stopping where the MR would need a stop. 

If they can both make a trip then, duh. 

If they both need a stop, then there's not really a ton difference. I used trip planner on a coast to coast US trip once comparing the SR and LR and it was like a 6 hour difference on something like a 60 hour journey. The kind of thing where the time could fade into the noise of what you're doing. Most stops are in the ""go do something else"" range anyway. Is eating for 35 minutes instead of 28 really that big of a difference? 

It really only matters if there's a trip you can't make in the MR you can in the LR. (And in that case, maybe even THAT will be solved with destination chargers where you're going. Don't need to make a stop in the MR either if you can get 40 miles back parked at whatever you drove there for.

First of all, you should most definitely test drive the car if you haven't. I drove the Performance AWD... I practically shitted myself. I also live in California and the day I test drove it was raining hard. I pushed the hell out of that car, I cannot explain to you the feeling I got the first time I floored it. Now as much as it sounds like that is just about speed it isn't. It just solidified how stable the car feels, especially the AWD version of the vehicle. I never felt the car get away from me, cornering was superb, no hydroplaning, it was just so solid.

The next important thing for me was the milage. This might not matter as much to you, but for me it's important. My situation changed recently, so I had to move into a place without a garage. So now my only means is to charge publicly or at work for around a year. Even though you're looking at 310 for LR and 249 for MR, you're really looking at 248 for LR and 199 MR because of the recommended 80% charge. 199 miles is definitely fine for everyone's commute. I have the challenge where I might not be able to get a charger every night. So I rather not think about it at all, which has pushed me to the Long Range.

Either way, test drive them to see what you think. Honestly, I can't see you going wrong either way. It really is an amazing car, and I cannot wait to get mine

What state are you in? Sounds like a new car, but I have no idea why it would not be labeled brand new with the DMV unless maybe that's an issue Tesla has in certain states (i.e. Michigan) where they can't technically sell cars. It also doesn't make any sense because you can't claim a tax credit on anything but new cars. Obviously, they expect you to claim the tax credit, so I'm guessing it's really not an issue and there's something specific with the DMV in your state.

>Then, he told us the car was a 2018. This was surprising to me as we ordered a new 2019 direct from the Tesla web site. 

I really wish Tesla would switch to model years like everyone else. If someone goes to buy a Tesla on 1 Jan, they get upset if they get a car made on 31 Dec because it's 'last year's model'. In reality, it's not last year's model since Tesla doesn't have model years, but that's the year it was manufactured in. Of course no one cares if they buy a car in August and it was made in June.

Some people are going to tell you it will kill your resale value. That's not **totally** true for Teslas. What drives your resale value more than anything will be the features on your car (i.e. autopilot HW, battery size, MCU version, drivetrain, premium features, mileage, etc.). If you go to https://ev-cpo.com/hunter/ for instance and look at used Teslas, they don't even have a default sort option for year. That said, no one can tell you for sure it won't hurt your resale value (certainly it won't help). There may be situations where someone decides your car is a 2018 vs. 2019 and you may have to point out it's made in Dec 18 and Tesla doesn't have model years. 

If you're happy with the car, I personally think you'll have less headache by keeping it. You can always try to return it, but I feel like you'll go through a lot of ass pain that way that might not end up mattering much. You're justified either way though.

My original delivery date was almost two weeks before when I actually got it.

They did an excellent job. I can't tell it was repainted, and the bumper color matches the body perfectly. Super happy.

From videos I've seen this is not correct and the amber lights should be off when braking. Maybe someone from the EU (or UK) can chime in.

The opposite is also the case... In the US version, the entire brake light will turn off when the turn signal is active thus increasing the visibility of the turn signal (even though it's still red). With the EU version this is no longer the case and the brake light is still on while the turn signal is active thus possibility decreasing visibility besides the color difference.

The larger packs is a must have to significantly differentiate the S and X from the 3 and the Y. They also need to charge even faster than the 3 and the Y. They can do this with a larger pack that can hold the 250kW rate for a longer period of time. Even though they are less efficient they will charge faster.

And before I get a hundred replies about “300 miles is all you need ever” consider these areas as well:

1.) Cold Weather - A true 300 miles in cold weather would be nice.

2.) Towing - With the Model X uses a lot of energy.

3.) Going Fast - Obviously if we stomp on our Teslas even a few times we are not getting 300 miles right now.

4.) 80% Charging - Rated range is at 100%. As we know that last 20% takes forever to charge. Would be nice to hit 300+ miles at 80%. Will significantly help with road trips.

5.) Driving in mountain areas.

6.) Off road or go to areas without any plugs.

7.) Significantly reduce road trip times by eliminating entire stops. 

8.) Better longer lasting camping mode.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,st3ycz,hx2fc5n,t3_st3ycz,"I was in your position.  I went with a used X.

I had a pre-order for a 7 seat Model Y

My Model Y was going to be $64,450 at the time, give or take a bit.  That was for the dual motor, red, 7 seats, and FSD package.

I started poking around at used Model X prices and found they weren't *too* bad.  I eventually found one in Burbank, CA for like $70,000, but it'd cost us $2,000 to ship it to Florida, plus the $500 order fee.  Well, the cost of the Model Y Pre-order was $2,500, so I just refunded that and applied it to the X.  Ultimately it only cost about $5,000 more to go to a 2017 Model X 100D, which also still had FSD on it.  This occurred in November 2020, so I've had it for over a year now.

I had to go in and do the MCU2 upgrade, as it shipped with MCU1, so that was an additional $3,000 because I got the FM radio tuner installed too (There's a drive in theater near me, I wanted to still be able to go there)

In the course of making our decision we went to the local Tesla showroom and had them show us a 7 seat Model Y that they had, so we opened it up and looked around and realized that the 3rd row was *not* convenient.  We wanted something that would be able to meet the needs of our kids as they grew into teenagers and not see them on top of each other, or crunched in the vehicle.  The Model X we settled on was a 6-seater that we agreed the middle aisle/row for access to the rear was super convenient and handy because someone in the back can just stretch their legs out.

I recently did a trip with my son in it and chuckled because he referred to the 2nd row as the ""dining row"" because there was more room to eat, and then he'd go back to the 3rd row so he could lounge around.

The falcon wing doors take a little getting used to as you have to mentally keep track of making sure there's enough room to open them.  I can open mine fully when in the garage, as long as the garage door is closed, but if the garage door is open then I can't open the garage door.

It hasn't been without issues though.  For the first year of ownership I've had to bring the thing back to the shop on a monthly basis for a variety of issues.

Last month was the first month I haven't had to take it in to be looked at for something.

There's *a lot* that can go wrong with them, so just be mindful of potential repair costs.  I wouldn't buy one out of warranty because of the number of issues I had.  I'm now in the 1 year of ""used vehicle"" warranty that Tesla offers and am debating on either buying a 3rd party extended or making sure my savings account is flush.

Fantastic vehicle though, I am glad I chose it over the Y.

If you have MCU1 (built before March 2018), you will not get many new features. Likely just bug fixes.

You can upgrade to MCU2 (built after March 2018) for ~$2000. This is what I did. However, I'm noticing that I'm not getting many new features either. I will not receive the blind spot camera, nor the car color selector. These are small features, but indicative of dwindling support.

Us ""legacy"" owners will have to either upgrade to MCU-Z (AMD Ryzen, but an official upgrade has not been announced) or buy a Palladium (2021+) Model S/X to get these new (and future) features.

Doors  
The coolness factor is a thing, mainly because of the doors. When we’re unloading the kids from the car we often get looks and comments/questions. The falcon doors get a lot of hate for being form over function, but they are pretty useful. When it’s raining it creates a nice little awning for loading children. And third row passengers don’t have to worry about hitting their head when exiting. The doors are pretty smart and are easy enough to override if needed.  
  
Space  
Compared to the Y, the X just has so much more space. Just about every weekend we use the third row.  In fact, I was initially bummed that we'd be missing out on a 7th seat, but the ""hallway"" between the captain’s chairs has been super useful for luggage and misc items if we're loading up. Legroom is a bit tight for adults sitting in the third row though.  
  
Tech  
The Model X shows it’s age with the tech when you compare it to the Y. Our X has the FSD computer, but has the older MCU1 infotainment computer. This makes some things lag quite a bit, like searching with the maps and touch response in certain apps. Plus we miss out on some of the fun stuff like video apps, quite a few games, and full sentry mode. We can upgrade to the new MCU2 computer for $1,500 which I think would definitely be worth it.  
  
Driving & Range  
The X drives as smooth as butter, but so does the Y. I do enjoy the air suspension, but mostly have it set to LOW at all times. I’ll put it on standard height when towing our boat. My biggest gripe (and largest FOMO) is that the drivetrain was upgraded for the late-year 2017 models, which made the car more efficient. There’s an option to “uncork” the car via software to give it faster acceleration for those later 2017 models; we just missed the cut. Also the range is not as good as the Model Y. We’re rated at like 210 when charged to 100%. Realistically we see about 190-195 miles from 90%.  
  
Quality  
Build quality seems good. It’s a weird thing but the first thing I noticed that was “cheap” feeling about the car was the sound of the seat motors and rear liftgate. Compared to Japanese luxury cars our family has always owned, if just sounds and feels a bit cheap. As an older car, the seats show some age, and it’s subjective but some can argue the interior looks dated stylistically. We did have to bring to the X to the Service Center for warranty work, including control arm replacement, new weatherstripping Falcon Wing top glass, and steering issue just to name a few. I would definitely advise on budgeting for extended warranty if buying a used Model X.  
  
Overall, if you don’t need the extra room and want the most refined, up-to-date car with the latest tech, go with the Model Y.  
If you can trade off some tech compatibility and range for more room and unique legacy-flagship, go with the Model X.",liamnado,412.0,0.994,False,False,False,412.0,3055,False

TeslaMotors,would buy if,7snfhe,dt62umn,t3_7snfhe,"I took the plunge a little over a year ago on a CPO Model S with 41XXX miles. Had a 50A/240v outlet installed in my garage at a cost of a little over $1,000 (it was expensive because of the distance from my breaker box, having to snake through ductwork and a crawlspace).


I'm thrilled with the decision I made and could hardly imagine going back to daily driving an ICE vehicle. Having said that, here are some lessons learned:


* Outside temperature matters a lot. In the coldest days of winter (high temps below freezing), my range is somewhere between 50% and 65% of the rated range. That means I leave home with 150 miles indicated range, drive 40 miles, and have 70 miles indicated remaining -- which is probably only good for another 30-40 miles, realistically. On the other hand, on cold days I preheat the car using the iOS app, and it's great to get into a warm car (and also helps extend the range a little). As a result of the cold weather impact, I tend to charge nightly in the winter but only every 2-3 days in the summer.
* I'm located on the East Coast, and my car has unlimited supercharging for life. Around here, it's rare to find a Supercharger with more than half the spaces occupied, except perhaps on holiday travel days. Nevertheless, we usually take my wife's ICE minivan for road trips, for the combination of interior space and refueling convenience. I'd love to use my Tesla more for long road trips, but it requires a mindset of ""enjoying the journey"" rather than rushing to complete the trip as quickly as possible.
* Supercharging is pretty quick. If you run your battery pretty low before plugging in, it'll be topped off in an hour or less in most cases. And they're typically located where you have things to do, such as highway service areas with restaurants, or shopping malls, etc. Using generic EV charging stations is not as quick as supercharging -- you'll want to plan road trips to hit Tesla Superchargers (as the car's Nav system will automatically route you do to!)
* Occasionally, EV charging stations offer an advantage -- such as when they offer better parking locations (and often, free charging) at places like malls, airports, etc. This is more for just ""around town"" driving.

Also, just my bias: You can get a hardwired Tesla Wall Charger installed at home. I opted instead for a generic 50A outlet. I don't know if I'll own Teslas for the rest of my life, but I'm pretty confident I'll have at least one EV from now on. The 50A outlet offers the flexibility to charge any EV.

Happy to answer any other questions.

At 40 miles per day, you could get by with a 120v socket; some people do. Though it is very common to install a 240v socket for much faster charging. 

With 240v at home, you could get by with charging every few days, but it's best to build the habit of plugging in every night so you don't forget. 

Traveling is very easy with Tesla superchargers. Finding all of the slots occupied is really only a risk in a few metro areas like Los Angeles and San Francisco; with some extra risk on holidays. Personally I’ve never waited more than 5 minutes in California.

Test drive before doing anything else because if you don't like driving it. All of these other concerns are moot although you might put that money down even faster than you can say ""ludicrous"".

Regarding the time for filling a gas tank. You actually save a ton of time charing most of the time. You will charge at home if you have a charger at home most of the time. Let's say it takes you 10 seconds to plug it in every night. You actually save a ton of time. With the average time to pump gas is around 5-10 minutes depending. With the exception of road trips etc, it will take longer, can be 30-60 minutes to charge enough for the trip. But assuming you do not do that every day, you still save a ton of time.

TeslaMotors,would buy if,7snfhe,dt6abfj,t3_7snfhe,"Others have answered your questions pretty well, so I’ll focus on a few things that you may not realize if you’re new to electric cars in general.

* Electric cars are more efficient in stop and go traffic. Generally with gas cars you get the worst mileage in the city. With electrics it’s the opposite, you’re using the most juice at highway speed.

* Expect much less maintenance on EVs. Obviously things like oil changes are things of the past, but also things like brakes are used less often due to regenerative braking (which slows you down without wearing on your brakes)

* Tesla Superchargers are the way to go when you need juice on the run. They’re faster and more reliable than other charging networks.  In addition to superchargers Tesla has a larger network of “destination chargers”, which are a slower charger. They’re called destination chargers because the intention is to plug in at your destination, since they may take 6+ hours to charge the car. If you install a home plug, it will likely be similar to a Destination Charger. Other networks also exist. They use different plugs, but there are adapters that will allow a Tesla to plug into some of them. EVgo and ChargePoint are two of the larger networks, each are best used with an account. Take a moment to research the different plugs. Tesla can interface most commonly with j1772, which is a slower charger, similar to Tesla’s “Destination charger”. These plugs are increasingly common at malls, hotels, grocery stores, etc. PlugShare app is another great resource that’s lets you find chargers across all networks and plug types.

* There is a such thing as charging etiquette. Be respectful of your fellow EV drivers by only parking at a charger while actively charging, and obey observed / posted time limits where they exist. 

* Expect a drop in range in cold weather, by as much as 20%. This is due to batteries performing less efficiently in the cold, and the fact that the heater is the single most intensive draw on battery life. If range is a consideration, heated seats are much more efficient than running the heater.

* Buy something you can take delivery on soon (S or X) and there’s a $7,500 federal tax credit + some states offer credits on top.

2. I just plug the car in every night, set it to 70% (more if I have a long trip the next day), and let the car figure out the details.  Plugging it in only takes a few seconds.  With a short commute, you probably only actually need to charge 1-2 nights per week.

3. See supercharge.info for supercharger locations.  There are enough to make road trips simple in most populated areas.  You can also use L2 chargers, but they're slow.

4. I've never had to wait for a supercharger, on the East Coast of the US.  I hear there are sometimes waits in parts of California, where there are more Teslas.  Tesla knows that and builds more.

5. Superchargers are pretty fast.  You can go from 0 to 100% in less than an hour, or the more typical 15% to 75% in about half an hour.  If you can eat within walking distance of a supercharger, you don't lose too much time on a road trip.  (You do lose some.)  Other chargers are much slower, and you want to avoid them if possible unless they're at your hotel where your car is sitting overnight anyway.

If you have a 240V outlet at home, an EV is just better than an ICE car around town, because you never have to go to a gas station.

>5 year olds are mining lithium, naked

Obviously isn't true. No kind of mining is ""perfect"", but lithium mining is like one of the least damaging kinds there is. Look at huge coal or copper mines, and compare them to lithium.

>Electricity to charge is generated with coal

Just tell them this. A new long range Model 3 can drive almost 600km, on its 75kWh battery. On a 100% coal powered grid, you produce 2.21 pounds of CO2 per kWh, so a full 75kWh charge will create 165.75lbs of CO2. Every gallon of gasoline creates 19.6lbs of CO2 when burned, meaning 8.4565 gallons of gasoline will create the same amount of CO2. That converted to miles per gallon is 44.1mpg. On a PURELY 100% coal grid, a Model3 is as good as a vehicle that gets 44.1mpg. There are only a handful of gasoline vehicles that get that good of gas mileage, that are not hybrids. As the grid improves, that fuel economy improves. Natural gas only creates 0.9lbs of CO2 per kWh, which is 2.45x as good as coal, so that 44.1mpg turns into 108mpg by switching to a natural gas grid. Start adding in hydro, wind and solar, and it just gets better and better and better.

>The batteries combust

And gas doesn't???

>The batteries have to be replaced every 3 years costing you thousands.

Obviously a load of shit.

But seriously, just use the math I said to shut them off. You can't dispute those numbers. My calculations might be slightly off, but everything I got is straight from government and EPA websites.

These mills had harnessed new sources of energy (water power in the form of water wheels and the new-fangled steam engines) to run the newly-invented automated looms than manufactured cotton and silk textiles--one of the largest and most important components of the British economy at that time.  These new mills were endangering the centuries old cottage industry that produced these textiles by hand in small shops using the method of hand-powered looms that date back thousands of years.

Today we have battery electric vehicles (a new source of power for transportation) that threatens the incumbent 120-year-old ICE industry with its huge number of workers, just as the steam-driven power looms threated the old fashioned ""putting-out"" method using hand looms in small shops 200 years ago. Fear is the driving force behind present day Luddite vandalism as it was then--fear of losing jobs, fear of the progress that leads to disruption in old established industries, fear of the effort needed to retrain to stay employed.

I am someone who has a major interest in cars in general and what I would consider a higher than average interest in technology. Because of this I frequent many communities online related to both cars and technology, and the last few years Tesla has sort of caused a ""crossing of the streams"" so to speak.

The result is a hoard of people who don't know what a carburetor is for thinking they are now car experts, last week they reviewed a new cell phone and this week they reviewed a car with the same mentality. In addition I'm seeing a lot of ""techy"" people who were driving 15 year old beater economy cars jumping into brand new $70K Teslas, then telling the world how great Tesla is when they have little to no experience with other modern luxury offerings. 

I guess to sum that part of it up, it's just generally frustrating to see a lot of inexperienced people jumping into a part of a hobby/community while acting like they already know everything.

The Seko union joins the conflict with Tesla. The union announces sympathy measures that involve a stoppage of letter and package deliveries to Tesla.
""The fight that IF Metall is now taking is important for the entire Swedish collective agreement model"", writes the chairman Gabriella Lavecchia in a statement.
More and more trade unions are now joining IF Metall's conflict against the American car manufacturer Tesla. In the past, the Real Estate Employees' Union, the Transport Workers' Union, the Harbor Workers' Union and the Electricians have announced sympathy measures.

Now the LO union Seko also joins the conflict.

After a meeting with the union board in the afternoon, the union decided to announce sympathy measures that will come into force on November 20 at 01:00.

In a statement, the union writes about the measures that involve introducing a blockade against ""distribution, delivery and collection of shipments, letters, packages and pallets made by Postnord and Citymail to Tesla"".

Seko's union president Gabriella Lavecchia writes:

""IF Metall's fight is also our fight. By refusing to comply with the rules of the game here in Sweden, Tesla is trying to gain a competitive advantage by giving the workers worse wages and conditions than they would have with a collective agreement.”

The harder part has always been hardware. Seems like Tesla has wonderful progress on that end thanks to their in-house expertise and bunch of folks they hired. Once they master the hardware (high DoF fingers, high-torque motors, enough battery to last a few hours, tactile sensors and F/T sensors), they'd spend time (or parallely working on it rn!) on high-fidelity simulators and collecting human-demonstrations data to train it to do tasks end-to-end. Remember that this is completely different from the approach Boston Dynamics took over the last many years - their work has always been on the traditional controls side without much learning. Learning has certain downsides, but with enough compute and data they can be eliminated! Boston Dynamics realized the importance of learning too - they started Boston Dynamics AI institute, although AFAIK it is independent from Boston Dynamics as an org and I am not sure how much of it is actually going into the product. 

Don't forget that there are multiple billion-dollar valuation companies working in this space, and Tesla is making insane progress when compared to all of them! This is a whole new market segment for Tesla! It's funny cause Brett Adcock tries to be Elon-like by starting Figure ([https://twitter.com/Figure\_robot](https://twitter.com/Figure_robot)) but Tesla seems to beat them on all ends by a huge-margin.

TeslaMotors,hate,69ey61,dh617x2,t3_69ey61,"Mainstream media outlets make a lot of money on controversial topics. The more people get scared, offended, or upset, the more they click links and leave comments. Hence why your FB news feed is so notoriously awful and why news in general tends to be pretty negative.

This is a win-win scenario for wall street, because as Jim Cramer explains [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMShFx5rThI&feature=share), hedge fund managers with a lot of buying power like to manipulate stocks by producing controversial media. Forcing the stock price to swing just a fraction of a percent downwards can be very profitable if timed correctly. And while long-term shorts have suffered on TSLA, it's still possible to make a pretty penny on short-term short bets.

Controversial media is also a win-win for long bulls, because it allows them to keep their cost basis down while they gradually build their positions. Therefore no amount of success will prevent TSLA from being subject to negative articles. Too many powerful people benefit from them. Basically the only people who get burned are weak bulls who take the bait or long shorts like Mark Spiegel who use the negative articles to continually reinforce their bias despite 60% losses. So expect the cumulative number of negative articles surrounding TSLA to almost certainly increase as the company becomes more successful and gains more attention from investors.

The takeaway is that you should not believe any of the garbage you read from mainstream media outlets. The information on those websites is pretty much only useful for gossip and entertainment. And using google news to get your information is like using McDonald's to get your nutrients. If you want to cut out all the harmful fats and carbs and put yourself on an information diet, go to the source of the content for these articles instead (namely earnings calls) and read a lot of books/papers produced by independent technologists and investment firms.

 Months ago, Tesla ordered tens of thousands of parts in supplier contracts. Tesla told suppliers ""to get ready for a massive production run because we're going to be making tens of thousands of cars each month"". A fair number of companies literally grew in size just to accommodate Tesla's gargantuan part orders. This did involve some risk on the supplier's part.

But Tesla's estimate was quite, quite wrong. The original ramp was a complete failure. They expected 5,000 Alcantara headliners this week and the supplier expected to be paid for 5,000 Alcantara headliners. **But Tesla doesn't have that payment** because they haven't made, much less sold, 5,000 Model 3s in the past six months, much less this past week.

So they cancelled part orders and supplier contracts. A ton. Tens of thousands. **They had to**. **They have no revenue** to make payments nor a place to store nearly 20,000 units each of every part in a Model 3, which Elon claims has thousands of unique parts. These are **millions** of parts.

So the Alcantara supplier likely said, ""Yeah, if you cancel this massive production contract we spent months preparing for, we are not interested in ramping back up just for you because who knows if your next estimate is right? Find someone else.""

And Tesla hasn't found someone else.

EDIT: LMAO, update from Tesla. This is a pathetic bait-and-switch by Tesla and an absolutely inane reply:

> As we continue to increase production of Model 3 and produce more high quality cars for customers, all Model 3 vehicles are being made with the same premium textile headliner found in our flagship Model S and Model X vehicles, **which has always been planned at this stage of production**.

Growth companies in general are getting a lot of scrutiny in a growth-constrained economy. Look at what’s happening with tech stocks- they can post Revenue and EPS beats, and the price still tanks because investors expected even more growth. 

Imo Tesla and BYD are now bumping up against a soft-ceiling on growth: new customers will be exponentially more difficult to acquire than the existing ones; for example, at this point, almost everyone who wants an EV SUV either has one or just cant afford one. So Tesla has a lot riding on the Cybertruck and the Model 2, the two most popular vehicle-classes currently missing (or rather, not sold in big numbers yet re Cybertruck) from their offerings (Pickup and Small Economy ).

I’m honestly not sure how well the Cybertruck will do, but I will say this- people on the internet vastly overestimate how “practical” American truck-buyers actually want their trucks to be. ~75% of truck-owners report using the bed once per year or less.

Isn't the fact that Teslas look just like any other car but are electric one of the nice features? This is like saying the i3 was going to change the game because of its weird design.

While correct... you have to keep in mind here that the average new truck price paid going into this year was \~$38k. 

This tends to fall in the light to medium duty range, fairly optioned. This is a large majority of truck sales and drives the sales figures numbers we all see and hear.

If Musk is fighting to get his truck to come to market at a price just \~$50k ... i don't really think the major manufacturers will be shaking in their boots. 

$50k+, for other manufacturers, skims the surface of their luxury, or heavy duty, segment. 

Although this is still a big market, it's no where near the size we all see and here in terms of truck sales. 

Now - if Musk turns around and drops a $40k 'bare bones' truck that can tow a house, has AP/FSD, 300+ miles of range... i think at this point everyone would be a bit concerned.",TheTimeIsChow,174351.0,-0.8761,False,False,False,174351.0,1025,False

Trucks are best selling in the US, but they come in a million different configurations. 3 different cab/seating sizes, 3 different weight/towing/hauling classes, Dually or fleet side, Towing or nah, 4x4 or RWD, 6' bed/8' bed, HD/Off-road suspension....

There is no way Tesla will be able to grab more than a couple configurations worth of market interest.

If the bed is less than 8', that probably rules me out, and many trades-people as well. Less than 6' and you are nearing ""not a real truck"" territory.",nreyes238,98603.0,0.802,False,False,False,98603.0,605,False
